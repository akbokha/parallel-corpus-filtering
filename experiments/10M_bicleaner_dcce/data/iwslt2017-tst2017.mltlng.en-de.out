this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before somebody heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which it is spectacular that N@@ SA was illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones from Americans .
but there is another chapter , that should leave a lasting impression .
it describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c US intelligence in it , in which the CIA was literally dra@@ fted for a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not do the chapter at all ?
the US Government .
for almost 10 years the government has been determined against r@@ amp@@ ons and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he was a symbol to condemn the government of the government , Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to bes@@ p@@ ate journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information , and if they don &apos;t protect identity of cour@@ ageous , they give price .
so as the government at R@@ isen ank@@ lo@@ p@@ ia , he did something , what many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ter had already been before him : he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , only days before the trial , something wrong happened .
suddenly , even though they were long@@ lasting for years , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in time electronic monitoring can hide the repor@@ ter and sources more and less .
instead of failure and fr@@ aud to make statements , this could also be done with the digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so the investig@@ ators did , without being an agreement , wor@@ ried his telephone at home ,
just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and banana information , his credit card , and even travel dates with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ Whi@@ st@@ ine and Ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised at his asc@@ ension to protect Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the Justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on National Security was the result that a Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ ars went to an journalists .
so we put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has always more possibilities to choose all .
but just as technology the government allowed to handle the rights of repe@@ ats , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact the moment , in which they get in contact , rather than in the following .
today , there are communication software , which has not yet been written when he had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is a Secure@@ Drop , an open source transfer system for Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet &apos;s most famous , which was developed by us today , and today I have been working at the end of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , such as in each ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the relevant news agency .
so the government cannot pro@@ cure any more information secretly , and many of the information that she would ask , would not be available from advance .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments develop all over the world always new sp@@ y types of sp@@ y technologies that all of us are at risk .
it is possible to ensure that no technology products such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to add abuse . it is the same important that we protect the next Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ ars ,
the over mis@@ ery in the supply of soldiers is modest and of over@@ crowded hospitals , the alarm to the sigh@@ ted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ In@@ sider that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect all of the constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global W@@ itness to provide a statement . &#93; this week we asked of news about a lottery from 11 million documents , based in Panama &apos;s law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax v@@ ases .
we will receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are invited to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the very first direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is returned .
there is also reports that a ban on the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ar al @-@ Assad writing neu@@ tered companies in tax @-@ rab@@ bits .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin carries a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are wor@@ ried about the next release , and to the next un@@ veil documents .
now , it sounds like the plot of an agent r@@ iller or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ ROM .
it seems to be removed from you , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty one are able to hide their assets in tax bun@@ nies and not all its taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global W@@ itness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret control phases of some few , to hide and veil@@ s -- something that we have been discus@@ sing and reveal themselves since ten years .
I think of many people all this world will be very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this control phases may work .
I always present it as a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what is the matter .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans so far , who came in these revel@@ ations to this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax phases .
but through the principle , after which these tax phases work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the United States .
in fact , it is so that one needs less information in some U.S. states , to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of non @-@ transparent in the USA has allowed employees to zo@@ omed to school children .
it permits sc@@ ammers to zoom out especially an@@ cho@@ es .
it is this type of behavior that concerns us all .
here with Global W@@ itness , we wanted to figure out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator presents itself as an African Minister , the susp@@ ects money in the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all until one lawyer &apos;s lawyer made suggestions how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course there was no money to get money . but there is no problem with this system .
it is also important to consider it as a single cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who sp@@ read@@ out our covered investigations .
it is not about a single political politi@@ cian , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works to be established by corruption , tax cur@@ ses , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to handle this , we must change the rules .
we have to change the rules in order to make this type of behaviour .
this may be very comfor@@ ter , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing could have changed , as if it is always the rich and mighty one .
but as a better optim@@ ist , I see that something has begun to change .
in the last few years we have seen more transparency , which concerns the owner of companies .
the theme took political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been captured in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the United States left behind .
representatives of both parties in both parliam@@ ents have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ents , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of control phases , is used as a means to ensure more transparency to the U.S. and globally .
for us with Global W@@ itness , this is a moment of changes .
we need ordinary people who are mad if they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy , who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use this type of transparency to terminate this type of the In@@ transparency .
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now allows such kind of tax s@@ cur@@ ses , corruption and money la@@ under@@ wear .
this is the story , just as I ab@@ duc@@ ted almost and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das were landed .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a ticket office .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; Where does you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he did even worse the whole thing : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says that he would go to the peace sc@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land the boot room of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I fro@@ ze on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken off ?
a wild strange living in my living room .
what if he is mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I rose from the bed , on the tenth of the flo@@ wery , and closed my sleeping door .
but he was not mad .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had bought from me , depends on his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as hosts . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood is foreign , actually friends who were waiting for him to be discovered ?
it was normal to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let us take a time step , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , attra@@ cting my fellow inhabitants and the rent is increased .
I knew that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , Cre@@ ativity can create it , be afraid of fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow @-@ inhabitants Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how we could earn something like something . our apartment will be able to stay in a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and established so &quot; pneumatic mattresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure to taste our cheese ham @-@ ear , completely different because we made them for our guests .
we were touring with them through the whole city . when we ro@@ wed our last guest and the door into the castle , Brian and I arrived .
had we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
the things came in rolls .
my former roomm@@ ates , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to figure out if you could make a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people public images from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the art room , whose doors can be reached when you come over .
on the Internet , it can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missile would be ign@@ ited .
but did not do it .
no one who is still with consol@@ ation would be investing in a shop , the foreig@@ ner allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned as children , they are strangers .
if you have a problem , you can refer to things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we had learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create confidence by design , among people who had never met before .
can design be made such a thing ?
is it possible to create design trust ?
I would like to give you a treasures , the degree of trust we moved .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs high when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I &apos;d like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock mobile phone with your left seat .
this quiet flight from pan@@ ic , which you see now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can &apos;t just read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel that they un@@ locked up a stranger in the hands of a stranger ?
most feel the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they stay anywhere else .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just times , who is actually Al Go@@ res Mobile ?
could you report on Twitter that he is the president of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your descendants have been revealed only once with his name ; when he tells you how he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you would have 150 Be@@ ur@@ ings they all say : &quot; he can really drink it very well . &quot;
how would you feel when your mobile phone would have to leave ?
because a good feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence of confidence .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to give negative reference messages .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their findings , before we asked them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we examined with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are similar to age and residence .
little surprising we trust people at most , which are similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ ten@@ ure .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by reference .
when one has less than three messages , nothing changes .
but if more than ten , it will change everything .
a good reputation is a good reputation .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted benefits .
in addition , we drove that trust is dependent on how much you get from .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells a little , as an example , &quot; hi ! , &quot; I don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not be accepted on request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is thus an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ ler works in your dwelling place ! I &apos;m doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how to create it with design , to produce this degree of content ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics should write something .
our entire company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages compared to strangers .
as we did not reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than prepared to put these advantages .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first , incredible luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a demand that had not been covered before .
for us the business is very good for us .
of course there are times if not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not been celebrated party or apartments have been devast@@ ated .
you will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project , I worked with customer service at the beginning of the project . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the beginning front when confidence has been broken .
there is nothing wor@@ sen@@ ing it than these calls . it works as much as I think .
the dis@@ appointment which one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , the 123 million over@@ sized nights had only a fraction of the 123 million .
for people entrusted each other to the right .
when trust works , it can be wonderful .
one of our guests did a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to remain heart attack due to seated activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives of life even though they are not really known .
they drive one in their own car to the hospital , when you dies , and wait while one gets a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they do not want to feel , they bring books over .
they even leave a longer stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , of course not running every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled about this concept for the first time , I asked me :
how does the thought of part with money inter@@ actions fit together ?
it is about economic trade here .
but it just is just called &quot; rental industry &quot; to name , it is not just the case .
share Economy describes trading , the human relationship promises .
people make a part of itself open , and that changes everything .
when one travels today , this is to compare fast food with fast food . it is efficient and is essential , but less authentic .
what would be when travelling a rich buffet from local im@@ press would be ?
what would be , if in every place one would have visited , a group of resident would have to wait for a rinse thoroughly and to show a quarter of a pub tour , of which you have never heard .
or if you want to learn from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to create apartments of a reason for each other ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would have the thought of common share ?
I imagine cities which allow us to provide society and relations , instead of sol@@ itude and atten@@ u@@ ation .
in South Korean capital Seoul this project has already begun . many parking lots , who belonged to the government .
were now offered to people . students who were looking for a stay ,
were conve@@ yed to people whose children were moved out . In@@ cub@@ ator has started .
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest for a stranger or even a host .
so the idea seems not to be so crazy as it was attached .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
therefore there was also before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why has just our works ?
apart from luck and timing , we noticed that one can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us to overcome pro@@ found@@ ly pre@@ judi@@ ce .
I find this amazing ,
straight to overwhelming .
I have to think about it , when a red Maz@@ da is over to me .
of course , we know that design can not solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I ask myself what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
an believers ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain under@@ wear , a terror ?
or just a delay in security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the bl@@ ame for your negative impressions .
that &apos;s how the media represent how I look like .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show that Americans think most would have no Muslims .
presumably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee shop -- double Esp@@ res@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a carrots @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ ke ,
and I am a practi@@ cing , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , for baby , I was not born so .
I decided to decide .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as hom@@ osexual men , as some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you afflicted yourself ? &quot;
that was then : at that time it was a fem@@ inist declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty deal .
I have not only passed the faith of my parents .
I have with the cor@@ als .
I read it , I thought in question , doub@@ ted and thought out .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication , which deep@@ ening with each reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me sometimes to the crying .
I know myself there . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel the feeling that someone does , you under@@ stands , and yet somehow loves ?
so it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I was later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the valley of the Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen in my kitchen , looking at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ at . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes in buildings , people spread out of buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock has changed quickly in indignation .
why should one do so anything ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I moved to the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country had been attacked , but in the N@@ u , the acts of others from one citizen into a susp@@ ects .
on that same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and begin with post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I continued to wel@@ ve myself -- so deep it went into my seat in my seat , and I feared the first time when Muslims are recognized .
we moved in this night to our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Watch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in well lit areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t give you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was a week in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathered together .
and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; does not go on that first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting on me .
the feelings were foolish , and I heard also of attacks on Muslims or men who was held for Muslims who were drow@@ ned for Muslims .
there was really Bran@@ dan@@ es on Mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right now .
because the people who attacked this land have attacked our country .
I have dar@@ ed the rage of the people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was mad .
it is not easy to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the exc@@ uses that are hard .
nowadays we can actually tell people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like from a tumor in the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or gut@@ ters ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor size can be removed as a whole and a well @-@ like tumor to observe even under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are Muslims , as all other Americans , not a tumour in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ go@@ el@@ fers and Olymp@@ ion@@ aries .
will I make the closure of the Mos@@ ques safer ?
it may be a few parking lots , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faith , and to show greater participation .
and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently declared : people are actually not ra@@ dic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are ra@@ dic@@ alised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer .
at the Radi@@ ation process we have found that it starts out online . as the first one , the person may believe that the person does believe that the terror@@ ists are real Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alisation , we need to keep people going to the mosque .
some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
after all , a group of like the IS is justified with the Quran .
as the Muslim , as a man , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would like to add to its creation , if one recognizes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups say their ide@@ ology grounds in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but when you cast a look at her , she doesn &apos;t drive what they read in her &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me a amazing story :
a girl came to him because she was able to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they have been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit , with whom she had spoken , she brought her wrath to silence , and said that her anger , her sense for the un@@ righteousness of the world , she would only bring in trouble .
nothing inspired and something that had been given to her rage , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization of the extre@@ mi@@ sts which you promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m turned the connection to God and their church .
instead of having accused her anger , he showed her constru@@ ctive paths for a real change in the world .
what they learned within the mosque , they kept it to the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy , on our thought freedom ?
a study -- actually need several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show if we fear us , at least three things happen .
we do not accept an author@@ itarian system , conformity and advantages .
a study shows : if one exam@@ ining test persons , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
it is not just an academic problem .
when you look when the sen@@ timent ended up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened on the ap@@ ron of the war of Iraq and two elec@@ toral periods .
so is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia not just the natural reaction to mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public in order to compens@@ ate the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizen .
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear fell upon us all .
at the assignment of collective debt , it is not only to explain to themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most beautiful , most generous man , whom they knew .
she visited him there , and he showed her life @-@ run . she was amazing and said :
&quot; when is like my Bru@@ der@@ lein such a wasted young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had arrived in the afternoon . he did in her apartment , as with the execution of Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ at@@ ism can not just be un@@ mor@@ ally , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or we stayed safe at home ?
we contempl@@ ate it and for us it was not easy decision , because the America we wanted to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion free .
we chose us for the Mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove silence , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes went out into the building hall , and what I saw , let me keep .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked , and called our guests welcome , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , faithful and non @-@ believers who came not to attack , but to stand by us .
in that moment I have collapsed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion on pan@@ ic and inci@@ dents .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on for number ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than the ones .
thank you very much .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so Dal@@ ia , you seem to have hit a Ner@@ v .
but I ask myself what you say that you don &apos;t think that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a reas@@ oning with deep @-@ dive factory , i.e. one exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
Dal@@ ia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , I don &apos;t say . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually how it is allowed .
if one looks to Muslims in all over the world , and I did that with the greatest ever done , people want to experience normal things .
they want to be prosper@@ ity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no sense an exception .
if people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . Dal@@ ia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , just before , a one @-@ one .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air @-@ packages in our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines built in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
you can reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space through connecting units .
you can also build un@@ load@@ able structures as well .
they have learned to carry loads to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and to react in general on natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order to be an autonomous system , it has to know collective en@@ ei@@ d , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new location technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available at the highest point e. g. &quot; start &quot; and landing . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail starter ,
a flight device tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other starters , it is efficient in the backward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most starters , it can h@@ over , and it has great advantages to start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a fli@@ rt page .
a limitation of rear @-@ rigid is that it is sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il as wind arches .
we develop new controls and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ bag does not matter in which the optimal position is achieved and the performance can be improved through practice .
okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the cause .
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller potential number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to a question .
Hel@@ icop@@ ter Hel@@ icop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate in order to viol@@ ate you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote control units , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear suspension .
we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner that used mechan@@ ically remote control device . it was invented in front of short .
it has only one mobile part , a prop@@ eller ,
no c@@ apping , hin@@ ge and trans@@ verse nature , no further positions or controllers , just a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much , so that it can fly stable and can move up in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the Heck@@ el . to get it to flies , I have to do it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , it is right to throw it right when I all meet , is low , so I show you a video which was filmed yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ ey@@ ard is a exercise in gen@@ res , this machine is here , the Omni@@ pot@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ers , a exercise in excess .
what do you do with all this transition ?
they see that he is very symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is equivalent in the alignment .
this will receive the au@@ ght ability to get there ,
move in space to all directions , no matter in which direction he is turned , or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from eight prop@@ ellers .
some of them can be displayed in models , the rest will learn directly at the fly .
let us see that .
if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliably .
this machine consists of two separate twin prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise direction .
when one builds them , they act like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly on the machine even though .
we will now demonstrate that , by doing half of air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took retail micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit it with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where in room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully motiv@@ ating these demonstrations to develop new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine can practice on Broadway a flying lamp screen .
of course it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us is the reward in the development and the work act .
it serves as memory , as wonderful and magical to our universe , and that it permits creative , smart skills to form them to a spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential , the bag is pointed out on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very far away , there were two black holes to each other in a very far away ; they walked through the mass of three suns in a ten@@ ths of pure energy .
for this short moment , it sh@@ one brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big button .
but they put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time po@@ uring itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
sort the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago , the life was just similar to the earth .
since then , the Earth has brought quite a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God arise , -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago a group of special -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most kept them for crazy .
but enough people recognised them as a crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation was financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O increased significantly , which improved the detection rate enorm@@ ously .
therefore we call him Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
in early September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some small , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colored mol@@ ding black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me ,
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : just two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the Birth of my daughter
and the leave of my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically , it was the fruits of my life .
all this , what I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at M@@ IT . he studied Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and its by Observ@@ atory like L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a tur@@ us@@ sing in the slope of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and put into the other .
at the illustration of the theory of the theory of the theory of rel@@ ativity , a correct dance is often found on the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts are extremely weak , even sm@@ iling , are .
on 14 September , for example , everyone was stretched out and stressed by us on the boom . the expansion of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the Com@@ ma , followed by a 1 . this is the L@@ IG@@ O staff to go crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , which is already absur@@ d , this length would have to be measured less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of the radius of a nuclear power . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text on gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt after the waves in the following way : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are great .
but physi@@ cists are Finnish and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published his success in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claimed that L@@ IG@@ O is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : fac@@ tions , the size of your mobile phones .
that &apos;s quite practical . for that way you can manufacture a picture or a card of things by taking it by several points coming around you .
in tones , this is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
it is therefore very difficult to produce a picture of things to produce you especially much :
the face of your child is about .
instead , we are looking for certain properties such as audio and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ break@@ eth them . &quot;
&quot; number Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
with them , we cannot produce any simple images of objects in all .
but by looking forward to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least the measured frequencies measured in the audi@@ ble area are at least .
therefore , if we convert a wave pattern to loops , we can hear all of them literally .
the gravity to listen , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has been busy very long .
SH : two black , not turn@@ able holes , zir@@ cons simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very fast , one hears the same zir@@ cons with an additional tone change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ Section @-@ Section @-@ Pro@@ gress !
it is a kind of motion package , shaped into the wave shape .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- L@@ IG@@ O following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ al noise &#93; , I heard this noise of the noise of -- SH : ... two black holes , each 30 @-@ fold s@@ ungl@@ asses that can be turned back as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : we are superior to us what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a weight of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , each other one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine that forces you imagine .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
there is a permanent meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this path we can listen to all no@@ ises and listen to the invisible .
much in all we can see -- practically or basically -- not seeing .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ia &apos;s stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about all of them .
however , the thr@@ illing physical processes occur in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through , since these op@@ aque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the ur@@ gy is covered by its own desc@@ endant .
with the aid of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible until the beginning .
and the most important thing I am optimi@@ stic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we have never seen any idea . things we only discover , by listening .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found the first start of things we did not expect .
my colleague at M@@ IT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : ME : the type of stars that carry out black holes such as L@@ IG@@ O , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to speak the suction bone for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O allows us to make a completely different angle of view on the events of the world , on the emergence of the stars and finally , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be done so cour@@ ageous as only possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great Det@@ ectors and the noise of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Observ@@ atory - a brand new generation of Observ@@ atory in Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the roots ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you .
some time I tried a experiment .
for one year I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I feared .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it brought me nervous that brought me in un@@ pleasant situations I forced to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I wanted to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I want to be live on television ?
no , but yes !
would I wanted to play with the scene ?
no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , removed my fear .
my fear , speaking spe@@ eches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes , changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , that changed my life deeply , on an unexpected . it started with a question of my little ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for all &quot; valu@@ ations , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; the estim@@ ation , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
she asked them once , if I could play with her , when I was straight on the jump , and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from then I swe@@ ars to play with them once you want me to do . no matter what I am doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I always say Yes - every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I am making myself very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has a great amaz@@ ingly tri@@ bution : just before short , I actually understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things out , get rid of life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create television . I create TV .
I make television , in large style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for this about 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each programme offers hundreds of jobs that have not existed before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three episodes , while at the same time are four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series will run on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series is running in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are par@@ c@@ els that I have created myself , and not only produced , so there will be time , really st@@ ille , creative time to assemble my fans of bon@@ fires and tell my stories about it .
four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , around the world burning .
do you know who this still makes ?
no one , so I am a titanium .
dream job .
I would not want to im@@ press it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author falls . &quot;
I tell you all of you who are so hard to work if you are now a company , a country or a class@@ room to say that I am not only on the computer when I say , I understand that there is no dream of dreams during a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all silence -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I stepped into the job , there is no other feeling .
my work has always been created a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s when I saw troops , when I painted on a canvas .
so as we dream a high sound , running a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and li@@ vid , funny and anno@@ ying , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cru@@ el@@ ly and r@@ ational . and the best of it is that sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when the work runs well .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sum@@ s sound like a busy street , I could always drive for ever .
many people take this when I declare to them the sum@@ s that I persu@@ ade me writing that the letter is prepared for me .
do not understand me wrong , that does it .
but the Sum@@ m@@ ity -- when I began to work with television as I began to work and to work and to build up , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t do any other than after size .
the feeling , not to be able to achieve , as according to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a work@@ man .
maybe it is called gen@@ ius .
maybe it is E@@ go .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of the ver@@ tex .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for the failure , and I know that I love the sum@@ s .
I only want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask them .
to make one clear : the more shows , the more shows , the more work , the more work , the more things at the same time , the more things keep me , the more things I write story , the more expectations it exists .
the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land , which I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ taken , over@@ hau@@ led , out@@ dated .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that their m@@ om is one worker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the kids of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine was silent .
I don &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not return .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ day , transparent weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , with perfect heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan Poker .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s .
so , what do you do , if that what you do , work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ y you out , uncovered the author @-@ Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what you do , one loves us to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves another , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s , if you stop the sum@@ s , if you stop the sum@@ s , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan Poker ?
when the song of my heart hears , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am on the way to the outside , but late and she says : &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to tell me when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and secon@@ dly , she did not call me &quot; valu@@ ations . &quot;
she called no more &quot; valu@@ ations . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I don &apos;t miss it when I am Titan bin and my sum@@ s , and here all changes from my own eyes .
and so , she says : &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and hit their sisters , we laugh much and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is excellent because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum@@ mer@@ ing , I can do nothing but to fit .
I am focused .
I &apos;m silent .
the land I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist anymore .
all that exists can be stick@@ y finger and hum@@ bled k@@ isses , delicate voices , juni@@ ors and song , in which it goes , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so just that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
the opposite is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost is in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work towers , the titanium box , that &apos;s just the substitute .
if I ask you , who you are , if I am talking to you , if I am sending me with the aid of shipments and TV lessons , and how functional my brain , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is not strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the river , which comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s ignored the pressure of the history that is to be done , the anticip@@ ation and the pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
true sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it just is love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me I will say Yes .
I am doing this rule , so that I can release me as a work@@ horse of any gu@@ ilt .
it &apos;s law , I have no other choice . I have no different choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
do not play for me as well as work .
the truth do@@ eth ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work as a home .
this confession &quot; confession is painful , because what a man really works than to be a house ?
well , yes , I .
be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too much is none of them .
we spe@@ ars around the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we grin@@ d soap bubbles .
in this process , I feel mainly sti@@ ff@@ ness , absent and confused .
I always check out after my cell phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you live , and the sum@@ s of the universe meets me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ?
you can also say it ! they always say Yes if your child want to play with you .
maybe you hold me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day@@ dream .
you may well , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Marien@@ ch@@ afer or K@@ eks have been replaced .
and my teen@@ y daughter speaks for 15 minutes long with me , am I mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , no need it does not need .
everyone can bring 15 minutes on the piece , even on a drag @-@ day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile phone , no lack of laundry .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my feeling , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for peace in peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it is about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
give yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find it out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;m g@@ onna make friends to read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I got when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in training when I wanted to survive for more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why can &apos;t be able to indul@@ ge in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return , if I do not work .
work not working without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens up , and I find myself in my office . I listened to a very well @-@ known tune , they meets me and my soul . she has led me up to new ideas . I put it back in full trains and love my work again .
I like that sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , that &apos;s not me ... no more .
bubbles and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but only one part . and I am so than@@ k@@ ful .
it is good to me that I am a Titan Poker . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan Poker trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play .
and yet I have everything in the grip . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like good mother .
the more I play , the more it is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the Sum@@ mon . the land , I create the marathon which I run , the soldiers , the soldiers , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel , the more you feel that unusual , naked and new living feeling within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I &apos;m getting born to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en here have no chance here .
&quot; you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am neuro@@ surgical gin .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us Neuro@@ surgeon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very small ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury to the central nervous system the patients often have a constant , heavy disability .
this is the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , trying to improve the nervous functions by different surgical measures .
surely they have heard from one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stim@@ ulation . &quot; thereby im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits ranging from neur@@ ons to influence the neuro@@ logical function .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , which led with severe trembling and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgical is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach to this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with something help , the brain can help itself .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was the executive doctor and worked on a day and night in the emergency recording .
I often supply patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at the skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a , you must control the brain and rising the skull .
in order to save life , one must decrease the skull of the skull .
this is sometimes necessary to remove a part of s@@ wollen deer mass .
instead of the s@@ wollen deer mass , we decided to analyze it with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is not a slight task .
cells of a tissue amount to grow , comparable to a very small children , which are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , it was able to stand Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a trunk of cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you are still known from Bi@@ ological lessons , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small denom@@ in@@ ings .
it is surprising to preserve that kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made a further fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells stopped different .
they divided slowly , and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells , but changed elsewhere .
we needed a long time to understand how they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large eb@@ rum cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the F@@ öt@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they remain ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of brain , as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted a piece of bra@@ ins from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells exactly cul@@ tured as it was Jean @-@ François
and then select color , to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the exception of the same individuals .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ transplan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re@@ im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we have im@@ planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and observed that they had completely disappeared after a few weeks , they returned home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so disappear they disappear .
in the second scenario , we have added a violation and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells were obtained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been im@@ planted .
the proof that they show , are these little points . these are the cells which we were in vitro in the culture .
we were not able to stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so , we trained monkeys with a manual de@@ x@@ ad problem .
they had to take food pellets of a tray .
they made it very well .
when they had achieved a stable skill level , we last recorded in the motor Cor@@ tex in the motor@@ ic Cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were gel@@ ding , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side , they see the monkeys that was spont@@ ane@@ ously made spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can perform about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury to injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
now see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later .
we can use them in other newly @-@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still , they be@@ ati@@ ate them with men .
I hope really that I can see you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that is wonderful , I am sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely fall .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one must fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : that is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- You have completed the research and tried the permission to launch clinical studies . if you see further into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will we allow the authority to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to select the patients receiving treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
you have to prove it first , that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us of it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we are doing a great mistake in the West , as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable feelings .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not correct .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev from Singapore and its major im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democr@@ atically .
in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not influence the savings programs , which were implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev or the Communist Party of China , or some of my re@@ se@@ ers friends who would repeat me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy .
I pray you , together with me again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save us the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ sive and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy , our societies become common , our future is dark and our great , new technologies .
on the subject of wear , I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction at the moment our business ships are threatened .
I call it the &quot; Z@@ will@@ ingly Summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and know him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who raises his long shade about the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but only a few know his ken@@ illing .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the waste spar@@ es and concert , however , could be investing there where it would be productive and income could be able to produce and even all the things that humanity are urgent needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds much money until one compar@@ es it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were around the same time in the same time and our financial institution , and absolutely nothing did , besides the stock and to rub the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital create the twin summit , which are not equal with the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , which could not invest heavily . just as Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who could not be investing in which they could not kill him that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ rolled up the circumstances that lead him to k@@ ills him .
this is my shar@@ ks with capitalism --
its extremely complex funds should be used to improve our lives , developing human talents and finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
I already believe . but before we continue , what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the company form , in which the Free and the Po@@ or are the majority of the government .
of course , the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy made of course too many --
women , foreigners , and natural slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these inclu@@ sions .
the decision of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that she gave them the working arms , and not only the right to free expression of expression , but more important and decisive , to give them the right to political determination with the same voting rights in question of state @-@ up .
although the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy had not kept long enough --
like a candle that shines very light , it is also burned quickly .
however , our present @-@ liberal democr@@ ats have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the US constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was concentrated on the free citizens and the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy occurred only when a complete separation of politics and business is possible and the democratic process has been laid down on the policy during the economy -- so the world of the concert -- a demo@@ cra@@ cies .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ inherited battle between the two , and the economy gradually mig@@ rated the policy and de@@ comp@@ resses them .
do you want to find yourself why the politicians do not have any more like before ?
it is not located at a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is the fact that one can still be in the government today and nevertheless not in power , because the power of politics into the economy has gone aside and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that makes it sustain@@ ably the animals , of which she feeds that they are hungry at the end .
it is similar with the economy that has the policy so far can@@ ni@@ ated that it grows by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . political assets is growing , the overall economic growth falls and the managing director of the concert are fri@@ gh@@ tened to invest the cash of their company .
the greater success of capitalism , the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the disappearance of human labour power and prosper@@ ity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must meet the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; reserves the control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the expulsion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t sunny .
the doctrine of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be , that the working arms can only recover a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : create the working arms !
capitalism does it , replacing a low wage employed by automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics separate areas , the automation can be higher , the fusion of interest , and the social conflicts deeper , as it was already very soon , as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re@@ designing the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and consider that we will democr@@ atically democr@@ ize the re@@ united area , otherwise we will be able to release the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
so the question is not that capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements that he has brought to survive . --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is re@@ sembles a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the human being in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; or through something that are stuck in the machines of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in a long convers@@ ations of the sense of life .
I think we may be optimi@@ stic .
so what would like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I want to give you all soon , some examples .
in the area of companies : please make a capital market before , in which one follows money , while you work and in which your Capital follows to you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is property of them who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and proceeds are derived from redeemed and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no differentiation between them that belong to the company , but not to work there , but employees working there , to which the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and au@@ ster@@ ity , and ultimately there is no ra@@ ining twin summit .
in the field of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies have had a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is acted in this currency , we call it &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos , &quot; and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially in particular before the background of a re@@ united politics and business .
the world that I want to protect you are more liberal , in which they preferred privileged persons and mar@@ x@@ istic , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ve , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ve .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a true democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we drop in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide on .
it is in our hands , and we are doing better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you compla@@ in in your biography themselves as the liberal mar@@ xi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something from what I &apos;ve just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we do that , technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Larry &apos;s &quot; long term stag@@ nation &quot; is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it is not only our Democ@@ ra@@ cies dest@@ abil@@ ize , but also the countries whose interest is low in liberal democracy .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant .
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and so I am perfect .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough after .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosop@@ hi@@ cal explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who mentioned the day . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the Red@@ ner you have told it very clear what you stop from the view of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the note of a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited the democracy to politics during the area where most of it plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely demo@@ cra@@ cies zone .
in some respec@@ ts , if I may say that such pro@@ voc@@ ative may say that China is quite similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- recall -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically seen .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
it was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what you can now watch in China , re@@ sembles the development that we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now planning to do what the West has done for the West in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of great dis@@ hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about their experiences as financial ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone .
not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone ,
namely , to say good@@ bye to self @-@ pleasing to say , and the per@@ ple@@ t that went on a massive ver@@ ge line through the Eurozone , and continues to fall massi@@ vely in the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek suburb -- the way , the first proposal was , who was the first suggest@@ ion --
unfortunately it was right to do . unfortunately , the powers will be chosen within the Euro Area , within the European Union , continues to be denied .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain a economic system that is not viable , through political will and authority ar@@ ism in life , it might be hes@@ itation for a while , but if the change happens , it happens to ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what do you want to see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change its layout .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously . ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who claimed after 6 months in office , especially in such a cl@@ amped situation , claims that he did not have a mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to submit the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honour@@ able interest in the sites of the wal@@ ker , to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring out our government , but because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distortion , they ran through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to stand that she had a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the ATM which has imposed us these policy , and said : &quot; this was a Colom@@ bian mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite a European European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
my criticism of the European Union and the Euro Area comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the dra@@ fting forces will be demon@@ ic , and the European Union shall destroy .
that will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , which will appear to me , it will also be the same for the future of the European as well as the non @-@ European .
BG : we hope very much that you lie wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you very much that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price have never heard the majority , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back on the decision , which Roy had arrived three years ago .
Roy Price is the leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it , shows the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fought industry .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that will be on the turn right onto this bend .
this curve is the valuation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows show this review .
if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , where you have seen a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this type of show .
on the left hand side , here on this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should say you enough , what goes at this end of the turn .
Roy Price does not give up to the left side of the curve , because I don &apos;t need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean age , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are in@@ spire them .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something like something , so Roy does not want to risk it .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he will receive many ideas for TV shows and chosen by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and to watch them online where they can watch them free .
and if Amazon gives out free things to get out what is right ?
millions of spectators look at these episodes .
however , they do not know that while watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who will start everything .
they capture when you start the show , when one p@@ auses the parts you ski@@ p or check out again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show them to produce .
in fact , collect the data , process this and the answer is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com for four republi@@ can U.S. trans@@ formers . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many to remember this show , because it was not so good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time when another company has pla@@ gued a Top Show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always looking for to find this a Super @-@ Show and he uses data to it but he makes it something different .
instead of a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews , which they give the shows , their course , what shows it etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like producers , which actor .
when they had together all the parts , they went a carriage , and decided not to make a Sit@@ com on four channels but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 @-@ evaluation on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course now is the question : what is happening here ?
one has two very competent , data reversible firms .
they connect these many data , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that about it ?
because logic would be somehow , that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work so , this is somewhat terri@@ fying because we live in a time , in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one can ever come in touch with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the USA , and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather to decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether one person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . this is not about that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data reversible companies are also false .
yes , even Google does not make mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is possible to predi@@ ct data analysis from influ@@ enza , the worst way , -- through data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a great news feeling . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it wasn &apos;t working suddenly ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the contradi@@ ctions of the publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data reversible companies such as Amazon and Google can sometimes understand something .
in spite of these errors , the data in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in case of legal translation , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ protected gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
do you have to solve a complex problem , do mostly two things :
as the first place to place this problem in its individual parts , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , put the single parts back together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only be able to break a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we own all : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces again , even if the information is in@@ complete , to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they should not have been able . but the decision on how to assemble all these parts , and make it a show such as &quot; House of Cards &quot; that doesn &apos;t stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first in order to contest TV ideas , then when they chose the Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision because they always could say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not lead to the required result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will become ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions with a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you will only shake the ball to get a reply . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will remove it later with a techni@@ cian demo .
so far , I have met some decisions in my life , whereby I should have to listen to the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more frequent , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic body .
perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . finally , it is on us to make decisions , if we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right corner .
and I tend to be very encour@@ aging news that in spite of the large amount of data on data , decisions can still be paid to be an expert in what you do , and risks involved .
for the end is not the data , but the risks , with which you will land at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
