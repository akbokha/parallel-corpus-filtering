<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before somebody heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which it is spectacular that NSA was illegal telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter, that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">It describes a catastrophic US intelligence in it, in which the CIA was literally drafted for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not do the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been determined against rampons and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he was a symbol to condemn the government of the government, Whistleblower and to bespate journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information, and if they don't protect identity of courageous, they give price.</seg>
<seg id="14">So as the government at Risen anklopia, he did something, what many courageous reporter had already been before him: he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the trial, something wrong happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though they were longlasting for years, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time electronic monitoring can hide the reporter and sources more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and fraud to make statements, this could also be done with the digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators did, without being an agreement, worried his telephone at home,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as his e-mail data, financial and banana information, his credit card, and even travel dates with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistine and Risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised at his ascension to protect Whistleblower. but instead, the Justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on National Security was the result that a Whistlebars went to an journalists.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has always more possibilities to choose all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology the government allowed to handle the rights of repeats, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact the moment, in which they get in contact, rather than in the following.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software, which has not yet been written when he had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is a SecureDrop, an open source transfer system for Whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet's most famous, which was developed by us today, and today I have been working at the end of the Press Foundation, where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, such as in each ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the relevant news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot procure any more information secretly, and many of the information that she would ask, would not be available from advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments develop all over the world always new spy types of spy technologies that all of us are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is possible to ensure that no technology products such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to add abuse. it is the same important that we protect the next Whistlebars,</seg>
<seg id="39">The over misery in the supply of soldiers is modest and of overcrowded hospitals, the alarm to the sighted water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect all of the constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leck of the story was published.] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to provide a statement.] this week we asked of news about a lottery from 11 million documents, based in Panama's law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax vases.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are invited to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very first direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is also reports that a ban on the brutal Syrian dictator Bar al-Assad writing neutered companies in tax-rabbits.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin carries a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are worried about the next release, and to the next unveil documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now, it sounds like the plot of an agent riller or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be removed from you, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty one are able to hide their assets in tax bunnies and not all its taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret control phases of some few, to hide and veils -- something that we have been discussing and reveal themselves since ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think of many people all this world will be very confusing, and it's hard to understand how this control phases may work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it as a Matrjoschuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what is the matter.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans so far, who came in these revelations to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax phases.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which these tax phases work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that one needs less information in some U.S. states, to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of non-transparent in the USA has allowed employees to zoomed to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It permits scammers to zoom out especially anchoes.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness, we wanted to figure out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator presents itself as an African Minister, the suspects money in the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all until one lawyer's lawyer made suggestions how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preferences. none of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course there was no money to get money. but there is no problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider it as a single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who spreadout our covered investigations.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single political politician, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works to be established by corruption, tax curses, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to handle this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules in order to make this type of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may be very comforter, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing could have changed, as if it is always the rich and mighty one.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a better optimist, I see that something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen more transparency, which concerns the owner of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme took political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been captured in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States left behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties in both parliaments have introduced a bill in both parliaments, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of control phases, is used as a means to ensure more transparency to the U.S. and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness, this is a moment of changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are mad if they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy, who stand up and say:" "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use this type of transparency to terminate this type of the Intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparency, which now allows such kind of tax scurses, corruption and money launderwear.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, just as I abducted almost and in the trunk of a red Mazdas were landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a ticket office.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him, "Where does you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He did even worse the whole thing: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says that he would go to the peace scps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land the boot room of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me say:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I froze on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I broken off?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild strange living in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I rose from the bed, on the tenth of the flowery, and closed my sleeping door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me, depends on his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as hosts. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood is foreign, actually friends who were waiting for him to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">It was normal to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a time step, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, attracting my fellow inhabitants and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I knew that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, Creativity can create it, be afraid of fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow-inhabitants Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought how we could earn something like something. our apartment will be able to stay in a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and established so "pneumatic mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure to taste our cheese ham-ear, completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We were touring with them through the whole city. when we rowed our last guest and the door into the castle, Brian and I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came in rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommates, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we would like to create a website, on the people public images from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the art room, whose doors can be reached when you come over.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, it can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still with consolation would be investing in a shop, the foreigner allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned as children, they are strangers.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can refer to things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we had learned that design is much more than just look and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create confidence by design, among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be made such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a treasures, the degree of trust we moved.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs high when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock mobile phone with your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight from panic, which you see now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can't just read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel that they unlocked up a stranger in the hands of a stranger?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they stay anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just times, who is actually Al Gores Mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you report on Twitter that he is the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your descendants have been revealed only once with his name; when he tells you how he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 Beurings they all say: "he can really drink it very well."</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when your mobile phone would have to leave?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a good feedback system strengthens the confidence of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to give negative reference messages.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their findings, before we asked them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We examined with Stanford a study. we examined how probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are similar to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust people at most, which are similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social pretenure.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by reference.</seg>
<seg id="182">When one has less than three messages, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if more than ten, it will change everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted benefits.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we drove that trust is dependent on how much you get from.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells a little, as an example, "hi!," I don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell much, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- "" "" will not be accepted on request. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">There is thus an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Toller works in your dwelling place! I'm doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design, to produce this degree of content?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages compared to strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">As we did not reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than prepared to put these advantages.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, incredible luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a demand that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times if not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not been celebrated party or apartments have been devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">You will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project, I worked with customer service at the beginning of the project. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the beginning front when confidence has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worsening it than these calls. it works as much as I think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment which one hears in the voice of the callers, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, the 123 million oversized nights had only a fraction of the 123 million.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people entrusted each other to the right.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it can be wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests did a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to remain heart attack due to seated activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives of life even though they are not really known.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive one in their own car to the hospital, when you dies, and wait while one gets a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they do not want to feel, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They even leave a longer stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, of course not running every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this concept for the first time, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part with money interactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it just is just called "rental industry" to name, it is not just the case.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes trading, the human relationship promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People make a part of itself open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When one travels today, this is to compare fast food with fast food. it is efficient and is essential, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be when travelling a rich buffet from local impress would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if in every place one would have visited, a group of resident would have to wait for a rinse thoroughly and to show a quarter of a pub tour, of which you have never heard.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you want to learn from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create apartments of a reason for each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thought of common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which allow us to provide society and relations, instead of solitude and attenuation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul this project has already begun. many parking lots, who belonged to the government.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to people. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were moved out. Incubator has started.</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest for a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be so crazy as it was attached.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Therefore there was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that one can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome profoundly prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, when a red Mazda is over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I ask myself what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">An believers? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain underwear, a terror?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">That's how the media represent how I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would have no Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee shop -- double Espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrots-Fitness-fanatikerke,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, for baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to decide.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual men, as some of my friends, but as the Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you afflicted yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">That was then: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and compared to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old felt to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty deal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the corals.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, I thought in question, doubted and thought out.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow dedication, which deepening with each reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik brings me sometimes to the crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself there. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel the feeling that someone does, you understands, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the valley of the Egyptian-American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen in my kitchen, looking at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "Eilat."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes in buildings, people spread out of buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock has changed quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do so anything?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I moved to the television channel and heard:" "" "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "..." ""... "..." ""... "..." ""... "" ""... "" "..." "" "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country had been attacked, but in the Nu, the acts of others from one citizen into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On that same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and begin with postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I continued to welve myself -- so deep it went into my seat in my seat, and I feared the first time when Muslims are recognized.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved in this night to our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "when I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" "" "Watch," "" "be careful," "" "lead in well lit areas" "" "don't give you." ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was a week in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathered together.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again, the warnings: "does not go on that first Friday, the mosque could be a target."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting on me.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were foolish, and I heard also of attacks on Muslims or men who was held for Muslims who were drowned for Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really Brandanes on Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right now.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this land have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have dared the rage of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was mad.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the excuses that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually tell people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to close Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like from a tumor in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or gutters?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor size can be removed as a whole and a well-like tumor to observe even under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are Muslims, as all other Americans, not a tumour in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ergoelfers and Olympionaries.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will I make the closure of the Mosques safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may be a few parking lots, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faith, and to show greater participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently declared: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the Radiation process we have found that it starts out online. as the first one, the person may believe that the person does believe that the terrorists are real Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology, is a traitor or faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to keep people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">After all, a group of like the IS is justified with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As the Muslim, as a man, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add to its creation, if one recognizes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups say their ideology grounds in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you cast a look at her, she doesn't drive what they read in her "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she was able to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they have been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit, with whom she had spoken, she brought her wrath to silence, and said that her anger, her sense for the unrighteousness of the world, she would only bring in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that had been given to her rage, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization of the extremists which you promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of having accused her anger, he showed her constructive paths for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned within the mosque, they kept it to the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy, on our thought freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually need several neuroscientific studies -- show if we fear us, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We do not accept an authoritarian system, conformity and advantages.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one examining test persons, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">It is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look when the sentiment ended up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened on the apron of the war of Iraq and two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So is Islamophobia not just the natural reaction to moslem terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public in order to compensate the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well-informed citizen.</seg>
<seg id="366">The use of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear fell upon us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">At the assignment of collective debt, it is not only to explain to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most beautiful, most generous man, whom they knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he showed her life-run. she was amazing and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is like my Bruderlein such a wasted young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had arrived in the afternoon. he did in her apartment, as with the execution of Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not just be unmorally, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or we stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We contemplate it and for us it was not easy decision, because the America we wanted to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion free.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose us for the Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out into the building hall, and what I saw, let me keep.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked, and called our guests welcome, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, faithful and non-believers who came not to attack, but to stand by us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion on panic and incidents.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on for number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than the ones.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a Nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself what you say that you don't think that you are a TEDTalk, a reasoning with deep-dive factory, i.e. one exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, I don't say. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usually how it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If one looks to Muslims in all over the world, and I did that with the greatest ever done, people want to experience normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to be prosperity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no sense an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, just before, a one-one.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-packages in our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines built in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">You can reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space through connecting units.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build unloadable structures as well.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads to deal with turmoil and to react in general on natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to be an autonomous system, it has to know collective eneid, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new location technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available at the highest point e. g. "start" and landing. "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tail starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the backward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can hover, and it has great advantages to start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a flirt page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-rigid is that it is sensitive to turmoil as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airbag does not matter in which the optimal position is achieved and the performance can be improved through practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that penetrate the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller potential number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate in order to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote control units, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear suspension.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner that used mechanically remote control device. it was invented in front of short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one mobile part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No capping, hinge and transverse nature, no further positions or controllers, just a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much, so that it can fly stable and can move up in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the Heckel. to get it to flies, I have to do it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood, it is right to throw it right when I all meet, is low, so I show you a video which was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Moneyard is a exercise in genres, this machine is here, the Omnipotter with its eight propellers, a exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this transition?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is very symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is equivalent in the alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">This will receive the aught ability to get there,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space to all directions, no matter in which direction he is turned, or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some of them can be displayed in models, the rest will learn directly at the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliably.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them, they act like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly on the machine even though.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that, by doing half of airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took retail micro-quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit it with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivating these demonstrations to develop new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine can practice on Broadway a flying lamp screen.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and the work act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as memory, as wonderful and magical to our universe, and that it permits creative, smart skills to form them to a spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential, the bag is pointed out on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very far away, there were two black holes to each other in a very far away; they walked through the mass of three suns in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, it shone brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big button.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time pouring itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Sort the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, the life was just similar to the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has brought quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God arise, -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of special -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most kept them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as a crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation was financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser-interferometry gravitational-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO increased significantly, which improved the detection rate enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we call him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some small, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, just a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colored molding black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me,</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the leave of my todsick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied Gravitational waves from black holes and its by Observatory like LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a turussing in the slope of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the wave, the space and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">At the illustration of the theory of the theory of the theory of relativity, a correct dance is often found on the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that Gravitational shafts are extremely weak, even smiling, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, everyone was stretched out and stressed by us on the boom. the expansion of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the Comma, followed by a 1. this is the LIGO staff to go crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, which is already absurd, this length would have to be measured less than a thousandths of the radius of a nuclear power. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt after the waves in the following way: "the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are great.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are Finnish and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published his success in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claimed that LIGO is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: factions, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite practical. for that way you can manufacture a picture or a card of things by taking it by several points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">It is therefore very difficult to produce a picture of things to produce you especially much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we are looking for certain properties such as audio and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaketh them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"number Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them, we cannot produce any simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking forward to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least the measured frequencies measured in the audible area are at least.</seg>
<seg id="521">Therefore, if we convert a wave pattern to loops, we can hear all of them literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has been busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not turnable holes, zircons simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very fast, one hears the same zircons with an additional tone change. this sounds like this: Wu-Section-Section-Progress!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion package, shaped into the wave shape.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- LIGO following: [Surrenal noise], I heard this noise of the noise of -- SH:... two black holes, each 30-fold sunglasses that can be turned back as fast as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we are superior to us what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a weight of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, each other one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine that forces you imagine.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is a permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to all noises and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can see -- practically or basically -- not seeing.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why masseria's stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">However, the thrilling physical processes occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, since these opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urgy is covered by its own descendant.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the aid of gravitational waves, it should be possible until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of whom we have never seen any idea. things we only discover, by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found the first start of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the type of stars that carry out black holes such as LIGO, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the suction bone for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to make a completely different angle of view on the events of the world, on the emergence of the stars and finally, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be done so courageous as only possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great Detectors and the noise of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatory - a brand new generation of Observatory in Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the roots?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year I would say to everything "Yes!" I was afraid of whom I feared.</seg>
<seg id="556">It doesn't matter whether it brought me nervous that brought me in unpleasant situations I forced to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I want to be live on television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I wanted to play with the scene?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speaking speeches, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes, changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, that changed my life deeply, on an unexpected. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for all "valuations,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"the estimation, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked them once, if I could play with her, when I was straight on the jump, and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from then I swears to play with them once you want me to do. no matter what I am doing, or whither I go, I always say Yes - every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect but I am making myself very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a great amazingly tribution: just before short, I actually understood that the "Yes" -Sagen to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out, get rid of life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I create TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for this about 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each programme offers hundreds of jobs that have not existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three episodes, while at the same time are four episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series will run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series is running in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are parcels that I have created myself, and not only produced, so there will be time, really stille, creative time to assemble my fans of bonfires and tell my stories about it.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, around the world burning.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this still makes?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, so I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not want to impress it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who are so hard to work if you are now a company, a country or a classroom to say that I am not only on the computer when I say, I understand that there is no dream of dreams during a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I stepped into the job, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work has always been created a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I saw troops, when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as we dream a high sound, running a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and livid, funny and annoying, clinically and motherly, cruelly and rational. and the best of it is that sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums sound like a busy street, I could always drive for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take this when I declare to them the sums that I persuade me writing that the letter is prepared for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Summity -- when I began to work with television as I began to work and to work and to build up, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you can't do any other than after size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not to be able to achieve, as according to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workman.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of the vertex.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for the failure, and I know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I only want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask them.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more shows, the more shows, the more work, the more work, the more things at the same time, the more things keep me, the more things I write story, the more expectations it exists.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overtaken, overhauled, outdated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mom is one worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells you:" "" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "I would like to go to Shonda Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the kids of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not return.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titanen-work, 15 hours-day, transparent weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, with perfect heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan Poker.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, what do you do, if that what you do, work that you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think of" "" "hay you out, uncovered the author-Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know what you do, one loves us to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves another, and knows how to feel the sums, if you stop the sums, if you stop the sums, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan Poker?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then, my" southern states "waitress" "" "is a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way to the outside, but late and she says: "Mama, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to tell me when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me "valuations."</seg>
<seg id="675">She called no more "valuations."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I don't miss it when I am Titan bin and my sums, and here all changes from my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so, she says: "Mama, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and hit their sisters, we laugh much and I read quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is excellent because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the summering, I can do nothing but to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists can be sticky finger and humbled kisses, delicate voices, juniors and song, in which it goes, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so just that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">The opposite is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost is in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the work towers, the titanium box, that's just the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who you are, if I am talking to you, if I am sending me with the aid of shipments and TV lessons, and how functional my brain, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, which comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignored the pressure of the history that is to be done, the anticipation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">True sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It just is love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this rule, so that I can release me as a workhorse of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no other choice. I have no different choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Do not play for me as well as work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth doeth,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession "confession is painful, because what a man really works than to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Be honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too much is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We spears around the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We grind soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In this process, I feel mainly stiffness, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always check out after my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you live, and the sums of the universe meets me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! they always say Yes if your child want to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naiv, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You may well, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienchafer or Keks have been replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teeny daughter speaks for 15 minutes long with me, am I mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, no need it does not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes on the piece, even on a drag-day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>

<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feeling, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for peace in peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Give yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and store it.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return, if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work not working without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens up, and I find myself in my office. I listened to a very well-known tune, they meets me and my soul. she has led me up to new ideas. I put it back in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like that sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums, that's not me... no more.</seg>

<seg id="778">It is good to me that I am a Titan Poker. I've never seen a Titan Poker trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the grip. my brain is still working. my campfire are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like good mother.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical gin.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very small ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system the patients often have a constant, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, trying to improve the nervous functions by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard from one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." thereby implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits ranging from neurons to influence the neurological function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which led with severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgical is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach to this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was the executive doctor and worked on a day and night in the emergency recording.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supply patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at the skull-Hirn-traumata, you must control the brain and rising the skull.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, one must decrease the skull of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">This is sometimes necessary to remove a part of swollen deer mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen deer mass, we decided to analyze it with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a slight task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue amount to grow, comparable to a very small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, it was able to stand Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a trunk of cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still known from Biological lessons, that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small denominings.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to preserve that kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly, and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like stem cells, but changed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large ebrum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the Fötus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of brain, as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brains from the non-linguistic area and then the cells exactly cultured as it was Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then select color, to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the exception of the same individuals.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotrantransplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we have implanted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and observed that they had completely disappeared after a few weeks, they returned home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so disappear they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we have added a violation and implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells were obtained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show, are these little points. these are the cells which we were in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We were not able to stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So, we trained monkeys with a manual dexad problem.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable skill level, we last recorded in the motor Cortex in the motoric Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were gelding, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side, they see the monkeys that was spontaneously made spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can perform about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other newly-ropathological models, for example with Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still, they beatiate them with men.</seg>
<seg id="882">I hope really that I can see you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I am sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely fall.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one must fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- You have completed the research and tried the permission to launch clinical studies. if you see further into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to select the patients receiving treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to prove it first, that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us of it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We are doing a great mistake in the West, as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable feelings.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not correct.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yev from Singapore and its major imitators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratically.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not influence the savings programs, which were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yev or the Communist Party of China, or some of my reseers friends who would repeat me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I pray you, together with me again to believe that Lee Kuan Yev, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save us the democracy, but that we need a trusive and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies become common, our future is dark and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of wear, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction at the moment our business ships are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Zwillingly Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and know him as the Schuldenberg, who raises his long shade about the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few know his kenilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the waste spares and concert, however, could be investing there where it would be productive and income could be able to produce and even all the things that humanity are urgent needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds much money until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were around the same time in the same time and our financial institution, and absolutely nothing did, besides the stock and to rub the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital create the twin summit, which are not equal with the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, which could not invest heavily. just as Ödipus father, who could not be investing in which they could not kill him that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled up the circumstances that lead him to kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely complex funds should be used to improve our lives, developing human talents and finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I already believe. but before we continue, what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the company form, in which the Free and the Poor are the majority of the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the athenic democracy made of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and natural slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the athenic democracy due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the athenic democracy was and is that she gave them the working arms, and not only the right to free expression of expression, but more important and decisive, to give them the right to political determination with the same voting rights in question of state-up.</seg>
<seg id="935">Although the athenical democracy had not kept long enough --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very light, it is also burned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-liberal democrats have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the US constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenic democracy was concentrated on the free citizens and the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy occurred only when a complete separation of politics and business is possible and the democratic process has been laid down on the policy during the economy -- so the world of the concert -- a democracies.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an uninherited battle between the two, and the economy gradually migrated the policy and decompresses them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you want to find yourself why the politicians do not have any more like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not located at a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is the fact that one can still be in the government today and nevertheless not in power, because the power of politics into the economy has gone aside and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that makes it sustainably the animals, of which she feeds that they are hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar with the economy that has the policy so far canniated that it grows by the self-caused economic crisis itself. political assets is growing, the overall economic growth falls and the managing director of the concert are frightened to invest the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">The greater success of capitalism, the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the disappearance of human labour power and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must meet the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" reserves the control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the expulsion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't sunny.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be, that the working arms can only recover a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: create the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, replacing a low wage employed by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics separate areas, the automation can be higher, the fusion of interest, and the social conflicts deeper, as it was already very soon, as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to redesigning the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and consider that we will democratically democrize the reunited area, otherwise we will be able to release the movie "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not that capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements that he has brought to survive. --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is resembles a Dystopia, similar to the human being in "Star Trek" or through something that are stuck in the machines of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in a long conversations of the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would like to look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I want to give you all soon, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please make a capital market before, in which one follows money, while you work and in which your Capital follows to you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is property of them who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and proceeds are derived from redeemed and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation between them that belong to the company, but not to work there, but employees working there, to which the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and work, no major gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately there is no raining twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please imagine that our national currencies have had a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [group of 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of the entire humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is acted in this currency, we call it "Cosmos," in units of "Kosmos," in units of "Kosmos," and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in particular before the background of a reunited politics and business.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I want to protect you are more liberal, in which they preferred privileged persons and marxistic, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesive, global keynesive.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we drop in a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide on.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we are doing better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You complain in your biography themselves as the liberal marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something from what I've just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and business is... do we do that, technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry's "long term stagnation" is called "" "" long term stagnation. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it is not only our Democracies destabilize, but also the countries whose interest is low in liberal democracy.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and so I am perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough after.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who mentioned the day. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the Redner you have told it very clear what you stop from the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the note of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited the democracy to politics during the area where most of it plays, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democracies zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, if I may say that such provocative may say that China is quite similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- recall -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically seen.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">It was especially skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can now watch in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now planning to do what the West has done for the West in the 19th century, smells of great dishypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as financial ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to self-pleasing to say, and the perplet that went on a massive verge line through the Eurozone, and continues to fall massively in the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek suburb -- the way, the first proposal was, who was the first suggestion --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately it was right to do. unfortunately, the powers will be chosen within the Euro Area, within the European Union, continues to be denied.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain a economic system that is not viable, through political will and authority arism in life, it might be hesitation for a while, but if the change happens, it happens to abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what do you want to see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future, if we do not change its layout.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously....</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister, who claimed after 6 months in office, especially in such a clamped situation, claims that he did not have a mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to submit the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honourable interest in the sites of the walker, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring out our government, but because they didn't want to deal with the distortion, they ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to stand that she had a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the ATM which has imposed us these policy, and said: "this was a Colombian mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you seem to be quite a European European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Euro Area comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the drafting forces will be demonic, and the European Union shall destroy.</seg>
<seg id="1032">That will not be catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post-modern 1930, which will appear to me, it will also be the same for the future of the European as well as the non-European.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope very much that you lie wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price have never heard the majority, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back on the decision, which Roy had arrived three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is the leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it, shows the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that will be on the turn right onto this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows show this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "" "Game of Thrones," "" "The Wire" -- all the shows, where you have seen a season, your brain asks: "" "" where there is more of these episodes? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left hand side, here on this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should say you enough, what goes at this end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not give up to the left side of the curve, because I don't need special intelligence to entertain "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean age, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something like something, so Roy does not want to risk it.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He will receive many ideas for TV shows and chosen by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and to watch them online where they can watch them free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out free things to get out what is right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who will start everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They capture when you start the show, when one pauses the parts you skip or check out again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show them to produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, collect the data, process this and the answer is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom for four republican U.S. transformers."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many to remember this show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time when another company has plagued a Top Show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy is always looking for to find this a Super-Show and he uses data to it but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews, which they give the shows, their course, what shows it etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like producers, which actor.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went a carriage, and decided not to make a Sitcom on four channels but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1-evaluation on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course now is the question: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data reversible firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that about it?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic would be somehow, that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis doesn't work so, this is somewhat terrifying because we live in a time, in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one can ever come in touch with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the USA, and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather to decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether one person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not about that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data reversible companies are also false.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does not make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is possible to predict data analysis from influenza, the worst way, -- through data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news feeling. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it wasn't working suddenly,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the contradictions of the publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data reversible companies such as Amazon and Google can sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of these errors, the data in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in case of legal translation, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-protected genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have to solve a complex problem, do mostly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As the first place to place this problem in its individual parts, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, put the single parts back together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only be able to break a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we own all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they should not have been able. but the decision on how to assemble all these parts, and make it a show such as "House of Cards" that doesn't stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first in order to contest TV ideas, then when they chose the Alpha House "as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision because they always could say:" "" "tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It does not lead to the required result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will become...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions with a Ja- or No-question you will only shake the ball to get a reply. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will remove it later with a technician demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have to listen to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more frequent, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic body.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. finally, it is on us to make decisions, if we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I tend to be very encouraging news that in spite of the large amount of data on data, decisions can still be paid to be an expert in what you do, and risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For the end is not the data, but the risks, with which you will land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
