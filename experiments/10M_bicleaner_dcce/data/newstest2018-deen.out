Munich 1856 : four maps showing your views to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where youth meet today .
a sal@@ ft@@ chapel , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers have the same reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s nervous if landing cards are not current .
this knows each one that had to be exciting because the Nav@@ i Auto Nav@@ i takes place in a green grass .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al of Bavaria in the State Government , are all other than current - but therefore very easy to play .
especially when you compar@@ es them with current online @-@ cards .
then the cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a til@@ table carpet , which one recognizes as such .
the large crossing card has been incorporated into the cities and municipalities of detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets .
this originated according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches Meas@@ ure@@ ment Administration council between 1810 and 1864 , and jump the first survey of Bay@@ at@@ ric .
your Customer : Napoleon .
in the spring of 1800 the French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops finally went away with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 1801 , today &apos;s neighbours , who created the idea of an extensive Bavaria @-@ card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian government management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original location for Munich dates from 1856 , and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian National Library .
the comparison of early / Today is the most impressive example of the state of the state .
the town has expanded in all directions and has grown .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
in 1877 , on the establishment of the map , in 1877 , was designated as the Munich district .
today S@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located right in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower Austria are concentr@@ ating around 1856 alongside today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmer against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the western park is , you can see nothing at the first glance : when zoom out a smaller part with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten flat pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ absorption &quot; which was derived from the property tax .
little plots there , today there are no farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Theresien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 , in the October 19th century , was in fact a meadow and a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar there &apos;s the historical map an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ qu@@ ons@@ leaf , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street names &quot; in the track &quot; or from the height &quot; on the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ field street , people were once locked to people with ma@@ dness .
there , in 1858 / 59 the Munich county @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was created .
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den accompanied the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist who is brought to death by King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the purchase of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
in addition , he denied the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition at the Anst@@ alt .
for 280 patients had been first place , later it was added to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ re complex in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ atri@@ cs in Germany .
young people now meet at the premises of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth shelter with training .
west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co , &quot; established by bombing of the Ir@@ ene anstalt , was destroyed during the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz was listed as &quot; Head of Place , &quot; the shopping street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change in the Second World War also brought in the heart of Mün@@ ker .
the bombs of the Allies broke out in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
a big remained until today - at the Marien@@ yard .
the English Institute , small business houses and a greeting from the Middle Ages were once at the Marien@@ yard , where these days work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der of the old Munich map , the old Munich map will compare with the aerial view today - and fill the hole at the Marien@@ yard .
civil rights group released Travel Guide for Missouri
the National Federation for the Promotion of Colour has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri by the discri@@ min@@ ating policy and ra@@ cial attacks of the state after Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for regular attention due to the state , since a set of frag@@ ment@@ alists to present themselves in the entire state and noted here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently approved law of Missouri , which makes people difficult to compla@@ in discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , caused the group to publish the travel agency , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have the injuries of the civil rights , who happen to people .
they are put together because of their skin colour , they are put together or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear Complaints in such a frequency which we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group of inci@@ dents such as ra@@ vis@@ ors against black students at the University of Missouri and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders died in the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state , and by the police of Missouri by the police , without having charged a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council also shows a recent report published by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri , in which there will be 75 percent more common than white in the state .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be ready to bring it , whether they bring chew@@ ing money or their relatives , they are going to travel through the state . &quot;
in 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 Hass@@ im in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ ver@@ bre@@ k report of the FBI , which flows the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
it is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of employment or employment discrimination .
previously , the American National Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued bud@@ war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , having committed local prosecution authorities to shed people due to hi@@ kes , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s further rein@@ pro@@ filing .
traveling companions are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in the last time advoc@@ acy groups have the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ Project is elementary
the fisher@@ b@@ acher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n @-@ Project is a successful project and will continue in the next year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag sealed Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture in front of the site .
at the right excav@@ ator of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the fisher@@ b@@ acher CD@@ U @-@ town centre met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into his operation in which he maintained 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and houses five apartments of holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is only regional guests at the table of the holiday guests .
since he is also called BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisher@@ bach , he called the Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ Project as &quot; Elem@@ ent@@ ar important . &quot;
I can not lead to such a steep areas .
the green area care for a lot of work , much must be processed with the motor sense .
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and top photography , &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann emphas@@ ised .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ on@@ ial operation and cultiv@@ ate this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he do not lead a bio @-@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the community has recognized the meaning of the wheat project and is happy to promote the leader of the leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the list of areas could still be gone out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and thought about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often standing in criticism of criticism
a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els of eleven people were enclosed in 2013 .
the conservation area is 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ged for at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of them was promoted over leader , a quarter the municipality of Fisher@@ bach .
thus the farmers stay for 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you make a really good job , without farmers and landing . &quot;
also for Peter White , the best food being produced here . &quot;
the state of Land@@ scape ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ t@@ emberg enables state funding of Wei@@ de@@ fer@@ ns .
the goal is the dis@@ closure of the Black Forest .
a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR conve@@ y@@ alties .
in addition , the un@@ ic@@ ir@@ ated area may not be tra@@ cted ( han@@ dic@@ tion@@ ist over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the claims .
for the fisher@@ b@@ acher wheat project 2018 , the application is currently being able to build eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build 16 kilometres of fence .
the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , which are calculated at more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House takes up the Statue of Liberty in front of the Statue of Liberty
the safety signs of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate these equally like any other - hence the overthrow Saddam Hussein &apos;s place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic number with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to dra@@ gging the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat bes@@ ee@@ pers and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have looked at him if he had done it .
but he attacked her meaning , and especially the importance that her was attributed to the famous po@@ em of Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta imp@@ anz@@ ee : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom which enligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em that you refer to which you have been added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively right , but as he formulated himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the ra@@ ged words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your labour , and your afflicted masses , which year@@ ns to breathe free to breathe in , to the afflicted waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ abor@@ tion &quot; was better to see on our screens .
he did not engage in literary criticism - he made clearly that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who were forced to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they had a high political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism , in an un@@ used classic image depic@@ ting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the object with the picture is a brilliant fem@@ inist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change the right wing of the right wing .
the large Schre@@ ih@@ as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , ar@@ gued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not allowed to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it is supposed to carry the torch from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is entirely and even a question of perception of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative fact of Lazarus was in it , to see how it exhau@@ sted from the exhau@@ sti@@ ve , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travels on the ships of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people that seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear .
and this is of course not to recognize the perspective , the Miller and tr@@ ump .
their torch should not shine on the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black , Scottish members of the United Kingdom
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle reminds of a time when two sk@@ ies were owned by the Great Britain .
the power director of the Field Athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Championships &quot; team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland has developed something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we will try to understand , and we will continue to continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type of road corner .
whatever the combination of the circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals , among whom Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team for the team mates .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
their surrender address was amazing , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and real feeling that Eil@@ id@@ h took all of course , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m Hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible , &quot; that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championships were seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ stretch of Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has been positioned five British and two European records last year .
it will take part of the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of races .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another ch@@ otte , which one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remembers her first world championships when the only other sc@@ otte was in team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Mann@@ a capitalist states that it is very proud of the fact that many of their country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ ishers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is so special , that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chosen me , making it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I obviously am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it shows only how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ des .
what do my speech concern as chapters ?
yes , I think it was good .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home World Championship .
it &apos;s really important to sit on this home support and to benefit from that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
I get a second chance to go there and compete again and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
block by critics on Facebook : do not work for a public service if you do not toler@@ ate the heating of voters
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him for all , from the internal policy to its political principles .
he ch@@ imp@@ ly imp@@ ly for the criti@@ que , safe .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Re@@ def@@ ness can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and dum@@ b , we will be like the sheep for battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work on it , to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people , and er@@ ased their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American National Liber@@ ties Union shortened him about the beginning of this week .
the governor of the Govern@@ ors dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vol@@ e , and the online comment was full of counter@@ acting effect with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when there is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest vote of the 50 governors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary thermal head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sent to use fac@@ ebook as pri@@ cel@@ est@@ res to join himself with its voters and to perform his ha@@ un@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ ade of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is officially referred to and of employees who will be paid with public tax @-@ dollars - unnecessary , and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ gan@@ s spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the governors and ar@@ gued that the block@@ ade of the comments was nothing further than a present@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of cast@@ ors or sp@@ ammers or h@@ ash filled people that vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a pastor , no roller .
they all told that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful , and not prof@@ ited .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ani of Bo@@ like , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ash full , but she asked to Hass@@ ade .
&quot; I commented on that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ ure and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary range of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think this idea , if a number of people takes place on the same topic , then they will be used by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the governor as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ cession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply block a critics , or deleted a negative comment .
it &apos;s much cleaner than in former times , when one had done the same thing , employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical leaders and bring to silence or demonstr@@ ators to silence .
but that &apos;s exactly what happened .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials who critic@@ ises his Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users , blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria when they banned a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers in multi@@ fac@@ eted between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous pamp@@ h@@ ers struck a lead .
and at that time Washington had anonymous T@@ roll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , the Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions , which criti@@ ci@@ zed its position about the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation of the UK with the Great Britain , prevail against the historical documents that were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to silence .
Re@@ def@@ ness , opinion and dis@@ course belong to our nation &apos;s basis .
and true gui@@ ding means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance club
former European Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on local comfort , because the Renaissance club is held in East Lo@@ th@@ ian the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
Nor@@ di@@ re , who led links to the final round in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links until the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is joined with the new venue as the tournament ambassador in the name of the association and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great condition .
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous man of this game , and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend the championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year @-@ old career .
&quot; this really feels very special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port said .
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was won in the year after I had won them from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciated . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday , returns to the action at home .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it is always a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you sens@@ ed this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed it back again , and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about it , as far as far . &quot;

less lung cancer by passi@@ v@@ smoking
over the past two decades less people have died because of passi@@ v@@ atives in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases were attributable to passi@@ v@@ ens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study Head of Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved his own study to this topic in 1994 .
at that time , 400 lung cancer cases were given due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
household connections prove itself as a very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing , and are located in the time , &quot; so the director of the Bau@@ d Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the location is more complicated than assumed , as in the ground there is much ver@@ berge , which is not listed in the plans .
the traffic that keeps the construction work again , represents a big problem for the part of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ign@@ or@@ ance of the drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red Amp@@ s and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already enorm@@ ously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was locked and only the buses are entitled to the passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .
but fortunately , we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian golden land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is cooked , they don &apos;t use stove .
they even use rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ an@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the carbon@@ ated dum@@ b is taken out and swallowed up un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i is sitting on the mid@@ wives - it has no furniture , where she also leads her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby S@@ umpf .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ ex .

of course there can be too dangerous too late : most vil@@ lagers are unemployed , and many drow@@ ned , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one finds it after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it .
it is a rare insight into the everyday life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elderly were to vote in the occupying troops .
an existing movement that touched for independence against Dutch reign , quickly against the government of Jakarta that maintains the control of the region and maintained foreign journalists or legal notice of it .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as desolate as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wood houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo roofs , which were converted by ro@@ asted in various gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few Indonesian only did their journey here , ref@@ using journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before the Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans came to a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there was also other changes .

Pap@@ ua is the world &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it &apos;s also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a plateau at the size of New Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has been min@@ ed at 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a charcoal resources valued at estimated $ 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , who ensure that Indonesia are preserved a real presence in the Indonesian military .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local operations and units paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
pap@@ u@@ sian claims thre@@ aten in greater autonomy , these golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to the activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua has been killed and thousands were tortured and imprisoned since 1969 from the Indonesian military .
mass graves in Pap@@ u@@ as ancest@@ ral country in the 1970 &quot; s were described in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is contained in a report from the previous year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electrodes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal decline of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week , Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development has changed , as Muslim economies are of the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning Cant@@ ons sell chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , served a mixed vegetables with pe@@ n@@ us@@ au@@ ce .
local people fight for it here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua declared &quot; explained A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to work in the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native Pap@@ ua - the m@@ om m@@ om &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cost by Pap@@ ua - its market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , in Volk@@ mer@@ ie and Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals are deceived .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the anticip@@ ation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was just two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children without and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
they told them their lamps , that they should switch on their lamps .
one of the soldiers took an impulse to her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , pursued , and beat the group with their guns , were victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired up in the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ed@@ o , was beaten so hard that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things going on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commander to demand justice .
they carried out hunting arches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle running and a bird @-@ sung - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators started stones at police and military posts .
when the audience was heated , the soldiers was sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released in the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ iah Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , looked at risk and called to rest and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned out , I was shot at my left hand in my left hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame is not yet speaking , but who spot@@ ted , but says that the ball from the ranks of the soldiers were gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; I ran to him and searched for his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot;
the editor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ ters that his officers wanted to only &quot; secure their station , because it was attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people are threat@@ ening to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the k@@ illings came to Jakarta in the following day &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i kept a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims , and s@@ ware to go to the historical abuse of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I would like to solve this case immediately , so that there will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
security Minister Wir@@ anto told in October 2016 that he has an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the supplement of historical human rights violations .
but the expres@@ sions started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the early 2000 &apos; s .
the point is that we have committed ourselves to go to this off@@ ences , but there are processes that have to run through , &quot; he said .
then he made a retreat when he spoke to Jakarta in Jakarta on 5 June in Jakarta , and said , He has no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything will be regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , who was accused of crimes against humanity by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai pre@@ ach@@ ments .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took these alle@@ g@@ ations with gri@@ mm@@ ing evil .
&quot; I inter@@ viewed four times during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in angu@@ ish .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , he sought the military to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting paintings did not have stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at the vil@@ lagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between village inhabitants and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , died one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned in an nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the vil@@ lagers prot@@ ested before the company &apos;s position office .
the police said that the vil@@ lagers put stones on officers who re@@ acted to them by warning warning .
however , locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot on fire and killing one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who was in the vicinity of the hospital and was a witness as the last one has been delivered quickly , then the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called for this to withdraw the involved officers and withdraw from the police force from the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ruin for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ ous development will strengthen the dis@@ satisfaction of the Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ et Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reaction to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arrested in custody in the past few years , under the pre@@ ten@@ se of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; National sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some dive never again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a trag@@ ical , forgotten site . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people here build everything they eat : mainly not@@ a and fruit and a leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot; &quot; &quot;
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold to the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a cost only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown to have arrived in a greater number since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the airport Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually to the better trained and wealthy immigrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary abilities to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in place to stay in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , chairman of the Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
the isolation of the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , the coverage of the international media will continue .
in the beginning of the year , French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported from Pap@@ ua as a lack of coordination with related institutions , although the rare permission was given to the movies .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is elec@@ toral campaign , to raise transparency and development , are not implemented .
&quot; there are new d@@ angers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia to peaceful eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West pap@@ ua : Visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure is limited to the Indonesian government largely on the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , N@@ au@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the UN Human Rights Council on the UN Human Rights Council , to examine the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have seen historically the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the alle@@ g@@ ations of the group and said journalist in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to shed the evidence for human rights . &quot;
the people want to know that more foreign governments are aware of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , attended under the leadership of human rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , they broke their silence and afflicted him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; in accordance with a source that also participated in the meeting but remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua says that they probably do not agree to j@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good inten@@ tions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai She@@ ba , &quot; says Gob@@ i , Chairman of the Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that there is living under the constant threat of a common military , living in arm@@ ingly educ@@ ating and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , had to look at their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as an &quot; bl@@ ame &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they don &apos;t want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and en@@ rol@@ ments , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ y led a last symbolic act of the Des@@ p@@ ence : the dead body of an op@@ ic was buried on a site opposite the police and military station .
they don &apos;t know that they might never get justice , but at least the persons responsible for their crimes are not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings to flee .
it is the second fire that is situated in just two years through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is called acci@@ dentally by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el @-@ tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , no injuries were reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .
&quot; we slept and we were standing at the fire alarm and the cry of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told an inhabit@@ ant that came to his name as George , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civilian authorities said that the units of the fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 pm GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool down .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for the people concerned .
the incident can be asked questions to safety of materials that are used in outer areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 showed that the largest part of the damage from the covering , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and facing the London Gren@@ ade Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through its large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the following two @-@ thirds majority are supported for this sport in Ho Chi Minh City , which does not only support the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classi@@ cs remain the traditional competition so much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this i@@ con@@ ian and historical competitions , &quot; says Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
you will continue to work to improve the application .
not only for the vote , after many claims it had come before the proposal to carry out the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists will have the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future will have the host right next year .
to reduce the cost of the organis@@ ers , the requirements are easier to do in terms of training places etc . and players will have to do less official media appo@@ intments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. Travel@@ er brings forth objects into the plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted by a survey revealed that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ washed items to the control points of U.S. transportation Security administration , including at least 6 per cent , who contributed to the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally banned knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 % claimed , they had discovered that they had traveled irrit@@ ated with fire@@ weapons , amm@@ o or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out for more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , he also noted that younger trav@@ ellers have mis@@ used the rules .
of those questioned that they knew they knew that they were forbidden to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent more mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X were .
the most common objects that were buried at T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent showed , knowing items with blades to have borne by security control , while 2.2 percent of women questioned , and 3.7 percent of the male respondents were confirmed that they had to have taken hold of forbidden drugs into the plane .
the company said it has been asked to find trav@@ ellers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dental sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers had been carried out by the airport reliability and how many people had been deliber@@ ately committed .
it is no surprise that people who are most frequent sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or in@@ ignor@@ ant - through the security , those who are most common .
however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA directives are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain that liquids can take with it or how much of it .
so , there is no surprise that the largest amount of the T@@ SA confis@@ cated objects are forbidden .
for a long time , the people who T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla order
El@@ on Mus@@ k is available with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so far , he has under@@ gone that part of the customer has withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation again .
in addition to the always tri@@ umph@@ ant figures , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k left Tesla leader El@@ on Mus@@ k at the announcement of recent quarter@@ ly balance for the first time : the cancellations made in the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had applied for the new car over the past months , whose extradition is expected for the new car .
now , in Mus@@ k , a total of 5@@ 18,000 orders have been withdrawn from the total of 6@@ 3.000 .
critics were always pointed out , that it only deals with a non @-@ binding reservations .
when cancellation is charged the 1000 euro ( in the U.S. 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; booking deposit &quot; full back .
currently 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations made by Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analy@@ st .
however , if the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders become the problem , the Tesla boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 it is supposed to be assembled - all models - 500.000 to be one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to mus@@ k currently , 1800 reservations are currently available .
those who ordered today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new , not yet in practice tested production roads without any larger interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the dis@@ agreement of the reservations for Tesla could be solved .
because then the company cannot dis@@ close their un@@ satisfied customers , in the distance of the country .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ eck is moving back to reducing emissions due to the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environment Agency , took its earlier decision to reduce the implementation of the rules of Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g in@@ adequate air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , as his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities against re@@ iter@@ ations faster than previous desol@@ ations .
he did not mentioned the complaint against its previous position in a Bundes@@ rat court .
it is about a deadline that ran on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of the ground o@@ zone by 2015 .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would feel the observ@@ ance around a year to study the plan to study more time to study the plan to inter@@ fere or inter@@ fere in local decisions , or to han@@ dic@@ ate economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a long time a reliable opponent on environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ eck has been repe@@ ating it to block , to block and to del@@ a@@ ying the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden return of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back to the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal President of Washington decided that the EPA manager has exceeded its authority when he tried to implement the Obama Administration , oil and gas companies to monitor the monitoring and reduction of methane de@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his swe@@ eping tide at o@@ zone standards quite simply the read@@ iness of the EPA for cooperation with the United States , due to the complex process of timely fulfil@@ ment of the new standards reinforced .
&quot; under former destruction , the EPA often did not comply with the dead@@ lines for the implementation , and then waited for the realisation of activists , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation of jurisdiction , and we take care seriously .
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA suggested that P@@ ru@@ by sometimes will use its &quot; awareness to the delay and all other legally independent , to ensure that the regulations &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans took place in the Congress on a more comprehensive publication of the o@@ zone of the o@@ zone .
a bill in the last month of approval , the implementation of the rules of 2015 will be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure has not been set up for vote in the Senate .
the New York @-@ General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the states that had been accused the EPA in this week , said the group deliber@@ ate to just@@ ify the legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our plants - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million Americans that are affected directly from the Smo@@ g , which exu@@ des in their municipalities , &quot; said cutting .
new York , in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ ine van@@ ies , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ Oz@@ on@@ one arises , if poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chem@@ ie@@ gs and other sources in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the un@@ standing smo@@ g may cause serious breathing problems to cause serious respiratory problems , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases every year .
representatives of the public health environment and the environ@@ ment@@ alists on P@@ ru@@ res surprising course change .
&quot; it is easy to keep how much pressure is needed to obtain this reasonable step of those responsible for the protection of the air that we in@@ hal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to fight environmental users and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tur@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July at 16.@@ 30 .
whether its idyllic location and nice view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , a popular place to stay .
visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and supporters of tum@@ ours at their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini highlights : &quot; it is a unique village of villages . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Württ@@ em@@ bür@@ g@@ book , Count Hermann of Sul@@ z , and the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ i Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
the word according to the document was based on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the embar@@ king parish church , also a local court that belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa .
so , people also lived there .
as from the description of the city &apos;s headquarters of 1858 , next to the village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the area of tum@@ ours are still visible , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the man@@ orial municipal core of the village .
old cards from the time around 1600 sub@@ str@@ ates these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ ite was formed from the early medieval O@@ enk@@ ir@@ chen@@ a law .
a Lord that built a church was built , and took part in a priest , and remained the owner of this church , and could also inherit the suit@@ ability of this church .
thus , the right to use a pastor or bishop create a new pastor .
three altars were in the church , and two bells in the tower .
the greatest of the two cr@@ aters in Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell tower was first recorded in 16@@ 92 but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .

association wants to test approval from wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned back to the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been asked to recover its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful to un@@ constitutional .
the association ar@@ gued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind power concentration zone .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines can generally be possible at the same time , the concentration zone does not affect the exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a few days earlier through a change in the bottle plan for a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it was not approved by the Düsseldorf District government because of a mol@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of planning foundation , the approval of approval is somewhat un@@ lawful and even to increase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the current stand of things : the City Council again decided the wind concentration zone at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an approval from the District government has still stands out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the author@@ ization of approval for the construction of wind turbines of planning to be legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circuit confirms the entrance of the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter have been received since last week &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circuit takes it on the occasion to check the issue again .
however , they are not expected to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the current proceedings at the administrative court , the circle was not subject to the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , is planning for an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to construction of four and 200 metres high winch .
already last year , the company had involved in which the town of Vier@@ sen is involved , P@@ oct@@ aves is closed with the owner of about 65 hectares of large terrain .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this equ@@ ates to around one fifth of the power requirement of all four quad@@ rons .
the NE@@ W re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer , there were a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ berg district .

tr@@ ump placed after continuous tran@@ scription of phone calls from telephone to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the mar@@ g@@ inal wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump , in a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , called for publicly to say that he would not pay for a planned limit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President imp@@ anz@@ ee him because he publicly seized the wall . according to report , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first ru@@ fs with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ around was also published and revealed an ex@@ cl@@ ed exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let the trade for the US refugees mig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence of the government would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said to the Lord Jesus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is the un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ massacres : activists perform ra@@ dic@@ tive Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men came with ri@@ f@@ les to block his way .
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a man middle age in a needle strike - took a long train on his cig@@ ar , looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants are in fear .
&quot; we want to have this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cry cry in silence , when a young black man was torn by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , was only a reproduction .
but when a rob@@ ber is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; nearly all of them were thrown into the audience very genuine diseases .
since 2005 , civil society for Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge came back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ ian Dor@@ m as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was charged with the murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ speak@@ able that no person was arrested in all these years , though we know them in our churches , though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ ite Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organisation of re@@ organisation .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Georgia and a citizen of civil society .
it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice was never corrected .
&quot; we want to be prosec@@ uted , we want to end , we want healing , we want to make atonement , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can not get to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a place of jurisdiction has a bed towel about the dead of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
according to the FBI records that have been received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding communities were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was charged ever .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , civil rights say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens to Georgia to the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to give their vote in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice of the FBI , according to the FBI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com , a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ ours had been in the city that H@@ ester with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy slept and that the baby was born of her husband , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , as the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cousin Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she was then removed from prison , the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b .
&quot; as it presents , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared the mur@@ ders and arranged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution that had not only involved in the mur@@ ders , evidence , and the identity of witnesses has failed . &quot;
bro@@ oks it was still very interesting .
&quot; it was a voting right massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; when you register and vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost one decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the annual re@@ location of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
its representation is clearly explained and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed to believe that he is no longer exists in America .
it is difficult to look , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confron@@ ted with its hem@@ at@@ ern@@ ity in all of us , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can not build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to or hear what I have done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ ended - in a space and loud when Gre@@ ene started a good overview over the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ at@@ Co @-@ Director .
he played the role of the Chief of Chef C@@ lan@@ ders for years , but he never said that it would never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story in life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester are playing their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ed and dist@@ ressed because he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , po@@ uring out of my own property ! &quot;
shaving er@@ wi@@ rel@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laugh@@ ter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the most impressive .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked r@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always chi@@ ev@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; said &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but one of the other black performer is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you must just hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
and there is exactly the energy in the room , a feeling of the camera &apos;s name replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy doing this , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts even once .
this time , when Ras@@ mus says the N @-@ word , it says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no laugh@@ s .
this repeat ends violent and fast .
there are Schre@@ ie , k@@ isses and then silence .
a woman clothed with a tragedy , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and leads Billi@@ e Holidays Ab@@ de Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people were silent and tears from eyes .
the audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down the road .
they have seen almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as afflicted moisture when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mor@@ de had remained a no@@ un@@ d@@ ote , but now when they found on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feel split .
when the last notes of the song goes out , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to in@@ spect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy than if he remember it .
after a couple of minutes , Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors take away the Lyn@@ x part and wi@@ pe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ cona surro@@ unds two of his players and breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; fl@@ ushing one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done it from a reason . &quot;
the audience will move along with the actors together with the actors .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulated about the reproduction with a black pair , which they &apos;ve just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought therefore to find words that the feeling left the performance .
&quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and those who do , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what that really does with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same space , T@@ yr@@ ite Bro@@ oks reminds on his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; the conclusion is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because it disc@@ usses the terror of what we endure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it is so if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not have his own history , who does not know his own history , is sentenced to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ il@@ ted the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental works , director Frank Cast@@ orf reli@@ es on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ vement from gigantic , six @-@ story scenery .
the shooting stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) is either a written road corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .

later Gun@@ ther has to be believed ( Markus oak ) in turn .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with a stronger appl@@ ause .
the stor@@ my is celebrated by Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who was humble himself and bowed his hands to Merkel &apos;s smo@@ kers .
great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself for the first time on stage - in view of the big heat again in alloys .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his ra@@ i@@ et@@ eam was expected .
in 2013 , in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ant Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto for itself , there were five years later big ju@@ bel , in which the nation@@ alized &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went down .
in Katharina Wagner , Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said just before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience had not only made a form of peace with cast@@ itch , but it was also a understanding of the visibility .
I go a positive conclusion .
Max quantity works as volunteers
they work in their volunteer year , equal to several sites .
where everywhere ?
amount : normally in stone furt in the furniture field , once in week I help Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked on the school already in an open @-@ day .
how are your experiences thus ?
lots : it is a nice , broad spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with adolescents , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , thus a late employed volunteer .
how does it come ?
amount : I made high school education .
and then a civil studies say , we say again successfully .
I know for me , that it is wrong for me and I want to make something different to work with people .

and was it so ?
a lot : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .

quantity : yeah , it is very variable .
it will always happen , where you make his FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the Alter@@ sheim to youth work - all possible aspects of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the oo@@ gs , thus in the afternoon care .
for me , that was exactly the right thing that sow@@ ed me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not enough to increase stand .
you always have other people &apos;s head , each of which have a very different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , who has been out@@ dated from the family - you must always have to enter it individually .
very interesting .
and you did not touch any contact ?
quantity : therefore I am not the guy .
it is a area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there is also a negative aspects , but so life is .

the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will reduce further 3,000 jobs by 72 percent , as a further restructuring program will be launched in order to overcome the pressure that the company is confron@@ ted .

U.S. Environmental Protection Authority re@@ affir@@ m a decision to en@@ cum@@ ulated a regulation of the government of Obama , that the states are obliged to in@@ sof@@ ten the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done one day after 15 states transferred the agency because of the step@@ per .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; and said they will show the agency &apos;s commitment to collabor@@ ate with states .
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ ined in a statement .
P@@ ru@@ itt was announced in June , the intention of the EPA and the O@@ zone regulations - in which part of the state of poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be set to determine where the cuts are to be taken to cle@@ ver the higher air quality standards - to be delayed by one year until October 2018 .

at the end , the decision was considerably improved : at two opponents , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ners decides to establish a common room in the future retirement residence .
prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing base part is signed , reported mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
although it is still going to continue until the church community is owned by the church , yet there is no planning for which a private invest@@ or is now more than a private invest@@ or .
there is a debate about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the ship have offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would have a living area - around 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council suspended , such a common room not as the meeting point only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ righteous living room , but open to the community .
for example , the word of &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the lap .
the decision to make the provision of funding for the current budget has already been decided by funding for the current budget .
construction is in the rehabilitation area .
if the establishment of a common room would be , T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision to sign@@ alize the invest@@ or to indicate that there is no b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs in this regard , the fixed position - which is reduced to the ambient temperature - as well as p@@ ult@@ z , which makes the construction height and the construction would be possible .
un@@ necessarily , so not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
if it helps : unanimously , he does the panel .
it &apos;s not as easy as the community room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela responded to the many very own buildings , with which you &apos;re not right on the common room from the window , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do it difficult to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the community room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks like a lot of a maximinum payout of seeing or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you don &apos;t give a surplus , but get a real one , in doubt the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speaking .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to submit to the decision by the decision , there will be three wor@@ ms .
so it stays with two opponents at the original program , Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ ises : &quot; when we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step , a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

in the Harz of Stern to Stern
in the Harz , the nationwide &quot; star path &quot; is to be created .
this is the planning of the observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet @-@ planet road in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the information needs of many har@@ vester . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement , and sporty performance .
members want to place along the planned route boards and inform them about stars and star pictures .
in the first phase to 2018 , the Association is planning a well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quiries to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hohe@@ ge@@ iß and si@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are to be supplemented by the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection .
accessi@@ bility is also a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star@@ base train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experience much knowledge , for example above the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star are stronger than another one , although it is far away .
also , in which constellation can find a selected star , and when he &apos;s best to see .
since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , at the highest , observ@@ atory of northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation to the six dark regions in Germany .
often there are far from the dairy road and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ Galaxy with a naked eye .
since 2003 , there are something similar to the Plan@@ et@@ arium &apos;s initiative since 2003 , which is a little similar to the planned star of Plan@@ et@@ arium - the planet .
starting in front of prayer hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and for the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the pieces with the single planets - including the d@@ warf planet Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly at the distance and a scale from one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ unk to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 75 meters away , while the sun measures 70 centimeters .
the entire distance of the planet is over four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours needed , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light of the world .
but the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .

after the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira towards 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the connection of the market , presumably after a tire plat@@ zer the control over his vehicle .
the passenger car sli@@ ps on the right to the vil@@ lagers , where he survived and then lying on the roof in the ridge .

Fort@@ y Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ aming chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping after the 2 : 2 season open@@ er to Braunschweig for the optim@@ isation of the def@@ ensive information in Au@@ e Points .
Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the initial appearance for Andr@@ e Hoffmann with the result also , as did not have the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two opponents at a lot , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .
in the Ore Mountains the rotary chain should also be optimised further .
and a gate after a fre@@ ak , the Fort@@ un@@ es want to catch up even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be so that no more next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to line &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team also looks better after the experience in preparation with the turning chain , than with the fourth chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are acting in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is certainly his cause , &quot; because we just found in the three positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we do not make us a lot of play errors . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; if you cannot speak after a deci@@ ding start from a mis@@ erable start , I don &apos;t know .
the achievement could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are standing on Sunday with four points and we can focus on the trophy , we will surely be able to speak of an ordinary season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to know his trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start in the season I only had to talk about six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be thrown down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann may believe that players from Au@@ e might even be a little fresh@@ er because they could have no heavier and complete game like Fortuna against a asc@@ ension with the bones .
&quot; but they are not known as 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ enders of the Fortuna .
although guests come from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday to the meeting at last ( almost ) a stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have gone away , because we are entitled to come under the first six , this recorder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are no team in the 2nd Bundesliga as well as to strike in advance , &quot; says Fort@@ y boss of the coach .
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gan@@ t and arro@@ gan@@ t . &quot;
and that Funk@@ el wants to experience his player on Sunday in the Sunday .
new results of the Swedish age assessment tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their ages , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons were older than 18 years , but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( puzzles ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
they should be more accurate during the asylum procedure for the estim@@ ation of age , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ational verk@@ et ) was criti@@ ci@@ zed by some refugees on the assessment of the correct age of some refugees .
until today , mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6,@@ 880 has sent the results and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eighty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older while in other 25 cases For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases , conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is asked .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant in the past months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are pretty constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers took over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there will be 4@@ 42 cases that we suggest that I was searching for 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper s@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det published the 5@@ 81 results published , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical retirement schem@@ atically , at the R@@ ön@@ t@@ gen@@ esis of White and M@@ RT recordings are analyzed , which are analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also criti@@ ci@@ zed in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ kr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ ean Institute , whose work comprises the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had a reason to think about that , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age to judge this way is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot tell it , we should not do so when we could say , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ending the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child is in@@ correct as an adult .
the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
fully equipped with the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well ahead .
a seven tons of heavy concrete parts at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are very good in time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , building manager at the public department and traffic in the Government of Freiburg .
in April the work began simultaneously on all three gentle bridges between ram@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is intended for October and ly@@ re is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , by Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete , which is suffering from a red B@@ unt@@ sand@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the two other bridges , they now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and transport security , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges led over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of Red B@@ unt@@ sand@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning , has a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge valve .
this is an edge mount that is used as operating modes .
the bridge of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge valve .
then the pedestrian walk shall be passed .
the special thing is that there are finished parts , a patent for the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bri@@ dging caps .
special finger@@ tips feeling the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the plans .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be pulled off .
for the bridges between the building buildings and the collection point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic @-@ trace is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher outskirts , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ hof farm &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; was closed .
the costs for the three ro@@ wers amount to 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed through the country .
A@@ b@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Prot@@ est in German potato sal@@ at
it is not so common to attract parties at a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is hard to get under a hat .
the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a wide alliance that shows peaceful flag at that day because the A@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell tells you to the &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names on the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the leading duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , is the Deputy chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already hours before the event in front of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally , the town pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well &apos;s place , but now takes place on the parking under the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the For@@ ums One World and one of the principal organis@@ ers , is really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salt , which could also be eaten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the woman who brought him back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police captured many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows the presence , especially at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ s@@ wan sulph@@ ur that has been trying to maintain an event in order to get such an event .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf , first asked in Dau@@ n , but there will be a cancellation because of the already assembled Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch not enough parking spaces available .
so , Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ y@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main cause , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also works : at about 20 o &apos;clock in the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ an area a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , several speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ pe@@ eled Af@@ D @-@ chair Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch their spe@@ eches .
unchanged is the police presence , but to date the civil servants had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the pre @-@ place have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 hrs .
the police can decorate - no special inci@@ dents .
trumpet meets trumpet
another hear with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series of Has@@ la@@ cher monastery morning , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; hits a classical German training with roots in bla@@ dder music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winner and winners of numerous international competitions and have held Sol@@ op@@ os@@ itions in European top orchest@@ ras .
this is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the lust , not only the boundaries of their instruments , but also the boundaries of the various gen@@ res are mer@@ ging .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combined with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange suite &quot; of the Jaz@@ e@@ ch@@ op@@ lau@@ re@@ ate N@@ ils W@@ v , en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed classical music , jazz and free games to a fascinating total art@@ works .
this cent@@ rep@@ iece of the program was premiered in Freiburg in this spring .

crime Stewart speaks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of her life .
but I &apos;d like to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart is completely open over their bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I remember gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood guest stars was one of her &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson who finally came out bitter .
despite the insured , the brun@@ ette performer opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love every serious , whom I have chosen .
or believe her about , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , crime gave birth that they are bis@@ exual , &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and seriously believed in the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused , or disabled .
I &apos;ve never liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially among them suffered them according to &quot; B@@ ang show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time they prefer to dress like a Bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
it really hurt me .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a boy .
I really felt afraid , fri@@ gh@@ tened and damaged .
well , I look back and think of me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public , they don &apos;t like to live to her love : &quot; people expect that you take a certain way and anno@@ yed me .
and perhaps I may design@@ ate me some und@@ ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify the whole public before all the public . &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much re@@ think ... today I will tell you as a population of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes guarantees that he has inherited the coal ins in five states , and have inherited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee adopted a statement on Thursday night , in which it said : &quot; the party exchange of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather go rather to work in order to make our country again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and control of the least legislation in history , the announcement of Governor Justice only is the last ref@@ usal of a party , which is not able to find a positive , agreed message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement called C@@ BS News .

in spite of its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was approved for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) references to state sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the Rep@@ or@@ ters .
&quot; the entire Council and the whole congress were delighted that Russian Federation has experienced that they have experienced some hot times and everything is possible to ensure that the Federation is re @-@ designed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above that Russia would accept the criteria for its launch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constru@@ ctive day , and I think the progress has been achieved , but the Congress is supporting the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to put Russia again , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the gui@@ ding principle was always that we wanted to split the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the World Athlet@@ ics World Championships , which will begin on Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the ladder of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia should have to fulfil some of the criteria for a recovery .

after that , the fun@@ eral party started in the circle of family , closest friends , representatives of the German Armed Forces as well as politics .
there were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ torate of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .

&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of high meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
that was the royal house on Thursday .
the Danish Royal aar is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard has already made a sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ g for the two .
the Queen may agree with the decision of her husband , and he called it in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he was not the intent to be buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ ehl out that he was not happy with his title .
he would have become king after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ in in 1972 .
he retired from the retirement in 2016 and lays down the title &quot; prin@@ cess . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark didn &apos;t get the title and function that he wanted , he could not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , LE@@ NE Bal@@ le@@ by , the boss of the Danish kingdom .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be out , be still un@@ clear .
but he didn &apos;t let the intent to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ y of the people always flew to the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand in his just under 50 years of rain .
in an auto@@ bi@@ ous Hen@@ rik , over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ises .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , little so@@ cks instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I &apos;ve used instead of Virginia tab@@ ak and that in this country the reputation had to be the brand of social intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope in respect .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
there were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to become a new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP on possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is due after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to come back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke to the resolution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from its Regional Parliament in Lower Saxony the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) was overthrown in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hannover lost their nearly one @-@ vote majority in the Parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the old Green @-@ dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ avi@@ d established its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained in Hannover on Friday .
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his Group .
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP were together 69 seats in the Lower Sax@@ on Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the ratio was inver@@ ted .
the new Parliament will be staged next year on January 14 .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green government must now decide whether they could continue to reg@@ ain in this situation without majority .
Stephan Weil , however , holds it for un@@ ab@@ ding@@ ding@@ y , that the country &apos;s day quickly resol@@ ving its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through their further notice .
the state of the country also sees the possibility that the Land@@ tag of the Prime Minister draws the confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers multiple options .
these options must be legally inspected , &quot; she said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is described in silence all the questions when they are legally reviewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ West ens Step &quot; but something cur@@ vy . &quot;
the politi@@ cian in himself stressed : &quot; I am not a betra@@ yal .
I feel very well . &quot;
it designated as a followers of black @-@ Green .
the Gre@@ ens required the ab@@ rupt@@ ly dep@@ uties for the return of their land empire .
&quot; we are of course of course , that she has received her Land@@ tag@@ and@@ at that she has received over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; the state of the Met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
the president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regre@@ ts the decision of El@@ ke T@@ o@@ west . &quot;
she decided that she decided not to guide a language in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the background there were no content differences , we can &apos;t finish this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz was sentenced to member of the Lower Saxony @-@ Green Party El@@ ke T@@ avi@@ d to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the conduct of the former Green dep@@ uties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters and voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote on Friday on Facebook .
he under@@ line the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to choose the Land@@ tag quickly .
the outlet of the west is red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in their fresh@@ ust their personal interests in front of the country &apos;s being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony will make this dirty In@@ tri@@ p@@ act and tries to hit political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
precipitation CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ uties to record El@@ ke T@@ ars to the CD@@ U .
the president of the SPD leadership in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw a li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets , with personal care@@ ers to fall down the outcome of the Parliament election 2013 .
at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD , SPD and Green had a small majority by a voice .
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves before Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ vers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about injured eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumers protect themselves .
the Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German Editor network ( R@@ ND ) address and response .
Mr. Schmidt , how can the consumer protect them from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the touch pressure .
on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ Food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder represent the most recent information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , we currently know that health end@@ an@@ gering practically is excluded .
takes over Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ medi@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
the food monitoring is part of the states .
however , my house has been switched off without delay and has been in dis@@ closure of Germany in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade also has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are well @-@ capable and health care are un@@ objec@@ tion@@ able .
if in eggs of the back@@ bone level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not convenient .
however , the eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time does not work to bl@@ ame .
sitting Production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the actual key , the production companies does not meet an immediate fault .
rather , due to the alleged illegal practices of service firms , they must pay economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices .
as always , there are too little control in the harvest .
is it missing only on staff or even at the excess jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have been uncovered .
the truth also belongs to the truth that food was and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
in this reason , a consequ@@ ent declaration of such events and hand@@ ing over to the states , in which off@@ ences can be given in cases of decisive importance .
I have already made several times much that I expect a final statement by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm algorithm really necessary for food sk@@ and@@ als ?
the consumer and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient food .
if a non @-@ legal insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are destroyed .
the manufacturer , dealer , and consumer are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically you must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ um@@ il in the attitude of living animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
due to all levels , consistently and high pressure must be worked on all levels .
I &apos;m waiting for by all the relevant authorities that the atomic fact that the atomic fact remains un@@ resolved .
how to extend the main rules of football to N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars to Paris
in addition , N@@ ey@@ m@@ ary world record transfer from Spanish to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain do not distur@@ b to prevent un@@ avoid@@ able issues of European football .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA EURO , as the leading organization that has supervised the European game has power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
the financial Fair Play @-@ rules that were launched in 2011 by UEFA EURO must mean that PS@@ G must point out at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar is financed without any major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars to France .
PS@@ G can make money to make money , that N@@ ey@@ mar is under@@ ed and bringing him into a galaxy of other stars , in the face of financing of the teams by the energy of the Qatar family .
clubs may apply for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but must have a legitim@@ ate income sources , which allow them to make the break @-@ even point in her on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs in their quest for success was enormous debt to themselves , effectively ch@@ ased and ris@@ ky to ruin , when banks or owners returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P rose from the concentration on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the &apos; business model , which was originally used in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to build the crew and build a global mark - to a harder matter .
over the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and though Plat@@ ini dropped from the Presidency of the Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to refresh himself with a revised issues .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount of b@@ illing over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five year agreement , so that the redemption for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 launched the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G has been reduced to € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the teams will be limited to 21 million for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season .
the UEFA is looking for clubs , who could try to over@@ look their financial view , taking up their revenues by companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ act of the PS@@ G can sponsor , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings should not exceed the default market rates , the UEFA EURO would not apply as a legal imes .
this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA Council decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the sponsor@@ ship of the PSA is held by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar will come to Qatar in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar was cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar World Ambassador will be easy to find out and another maneu@@ ver for UEFA regul@@ ators would be easy to find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA European Championship will still be any attempt to observe the rules .
the UEFA had no pre @-@ prepared convers@@ ations with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars Transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke in the condition of An@@ chor@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars arrive a blessing to Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars departing from PS@@ G that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with respect to Kat@@ ars last official owner on PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ manager Ar@@ cher W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservation of La League against a state that financed a club .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday .
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the financial crisis Fair@@ play because they can have different ways or have different interests if a country has a wide actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new s@@ og@@ gil@@ ance
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aboard Cho@@ colate has been made available for Swiss .
now the bodies are in front of a possible end : the airline sends the order new .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA issued a corresponding report by the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
following the current planning , airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current suppliers of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ person .
around 17 million small red @-@ red cab@@ bage panels spread over 14 grams a year before the flight leader in front of the passengers .
the Swiss Life wanted to make no information about the cost .
industry inspec@@ tions estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; northern Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ raine daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the promotional effect : for a she@@ ar manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
as many Candi@@ dates to the new call , the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y News .
but only Swiss manufacturers come to question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an renewal of the contract via Spring 2018 .
for S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a statement .
chocolate boards distributed to Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss Life closed a contract with the mig@@ raine daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was delivered in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate @-@ tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo , led Swiss to two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
the customers of the First Class with le@@ ak@@ eries are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie spr@@ ite , in Business Class n@@ wash passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi von Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

but as fran@@ chise feels it feels less than that time .
&quot; First Day of Camp , &quot; surprisingly good , not just because of its absur@@ d Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original history for speaking of vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .

and there is another mad @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant Plot , in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , who now is supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
how always are the exchange rates of the best part of fran@@ chise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who feels its former big Man @-@ on Camp Andy and feels like a old b@@ acker .
it is the moments of acci@@ dental ma@@ dness which could heat this Franchise like a sort of repet@@ itive conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot Summer Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band , how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;

during six long episodes there is gone , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which has been re@@ compiled to a lower length , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef has always been coming back to the American Embassy , whose lobby are always occupied by two thick men , who will swal@@ low up a heap of ham@@ bur@@ gers .

impact on drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the land
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , at the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Esslingen and Stuttgart numerous objects are searched for , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in Constance .
at the age of 15 , 15 accused were arrested and arrested 77 years and issued arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the public increased quantities of Mar@@ ih@@ u@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , gravel weapons as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
in the same raid in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects , German arrest warran@@ ts were issued .
the two will therefore be delivered to Germany by reason .
the action was involved in Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were used .
the Maf@@ ia members of the Maf@@ ia organized drug criminal , attempted murder , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and dis@@ claim@@ ers .
the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office has been identified during the summer of 2016 against the organized drug traff@@ icking in the South German space .
between the state ships in Konstan@@ z and Palermo , a real replacement and investig@@ ator of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the great bet on Wednesday morning , also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in particular , the examination came to the vis@@ age of Italian nationals with respect to Italian Maf@@ ia .
also an incident on 27 May in hip started when several shots were fired at a restaurant in the morning , should go to the bank account of the gang .
wise be@@ mo@@ cks large g@@ aps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lead to partly serious decisions on asylum procedures .
the commission@@ er for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has taken a media report on large g@@ aps in the center of associations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may cause defic@@ ien@@ cies with the registered data on asylum procedures and shifts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the register , there are estimated to be ten million people with foreign nationality , including around 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by roughly 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been well maintained , the data quality of the data is not good enough so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens , who have become German citizens , and that they should not be able to emerge in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data backup can be significantly slow@@ down considerably , &quot; says it further on the report .
in the statistics on travel expenses of people , this EU citizens were captured , who would not have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such wrong orders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , led to a distor@@ ted debate on the use of reconciliation with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says in the Analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously began to return refugee families with under 16 years of children back to Italy if they have traveled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this go out of an internal paper for migration and refugees ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New Osn@@ ab@@ le@@ er newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper is therefore said that B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - except of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 .
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on the spot .
after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to achieve it first .
when a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the traveler .
for the grounds , this is the case : &quot; meanwhile , the exceptional capacity for families with minor children are considerably increased in Italy . &quot;
Italy voted for recording and accomodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ M@@ R ) hold this additives for sufficient .
other EU states would also return to refugees as part of the Dublin &apos;s agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke criti@@ ci@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten adverse conditions in the Italian Asyl@@ um System of Human Rights and an end@@ an@@ gering of the childhood . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and slow@@ down of inflation the spec@@ ulation about an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of a rein@@ forcing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy decision @-@ makers of the Committee ( MP@@ C ) of the Bank agree with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.25 % , where the weak economic growth has caused the support for an increase in the weak economic growth .
in its quarter@@ ly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that the pressure is expected to continue to rise to barely 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years of interest rates , it would be necessary to control the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ ite and said that credit card could possibly rise more than expected in financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth business cycle package which was issued before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will be time to demand for the financing plan , in order to provide cheaper financial aid for banks , although it is expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling silver .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the MP@@ C the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to decrease consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the interest rates they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain threshold of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the cooling of inflation and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be required than the markets await . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets is currently increasing the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank empha@@ sized that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank revised growth forecast for this and next year is expected to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the projected forecast in May .
it maintained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages over the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision in no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have increased the increasing expectations to a interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it &apos;s easy to recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
the youngest inflation report offered a little enthusiasm for households that are affected by a rising inflation and slight increase of hearing , as the deep@@ ening first is even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it added that the monetary policy in the next few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cannot prevent his income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it added that wages are expected to recover significantly at the end of their three @-@ year @-@ term &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated for a proportion of lower consumer spending .
the decision is a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the tor@@ so .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until the prices and the economy will be complete .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank at interest rates , the call increased after a t@@ interest rate , as inflation increased the pressure on tough households , with three political makers in July , increased to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected to be put back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to their aim of 2 % &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest return from the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive , as the loan supplier would seek to end many shops and the year in a positive way .
the market looks very good for those who run the existing De@@ als and include the new mort@@ gage , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to drive a controversial of HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people .
in September following a fight against funding of the drug in N@@ HS , patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse on high risk ph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of risk in high risk factors by around 86 percent , now is provided by the healthcare service over a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he prepared himself to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court of Justice in the last year , according to which the N@@ HS had to pay the evidence that the local authorities should finance him .
on Thursday , chess ho@@ ist announced by N@@ HS England @-@ chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) was designated as &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first that will enable the application of human beings , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced in all over England .
preventive ph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV prevention that are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduced the HIV transmission at risk of infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such medicines may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to question , they belong to the treatment of sexual or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successfully treated .
clinics are identified , identi@@ fying the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known due to anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who are registered in England and registered in a home position , can also register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the programme will receive £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines in this week after an international competitive pro@@ cu@@ rement .
the study is set to evaluate the full potential of Pr@@ EP by using clinical trials , as used in a large scale specifically and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to maintain HIV by HIV .
it is another milestone in which more than three decades continued adv@@ ancement in progress of one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive Officer NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in combat against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to needy and endangered people , the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to become people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS financed trial in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives .
we welcome you to this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority has to be done quickly throughout the country and that no one that has a risk for HIV / AIDS is left .
now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are entitled to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Sha@@ dows @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is to be welcomed and passed through the government after months of delay .
the evidence show how transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and end the transfer of this drug infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study will be carried out as fast as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will help to join HIV in the company &apos;s termination to a step closer . &quot;
living the big living : mezzanine and cle@@ ver designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge at a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have loved it in love and made a bid on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a woven layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - a jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was a 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home which was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms superior to each other , so that the architectural challenge existed to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative to solve the provision .
&quot; the steel body is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ amped into one another without having to g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t just enough to build a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height above or below the right height . &quot;
this order made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine is a classic copper engraving from ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ ous living area down .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ able units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
thanks to perception of a gl@@ am@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut up the kitchen when it is not used .
folded kitchen are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineers went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ Do@@ or .
&quot; it is mutual important to slide when you slide the door , very easy to guide . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate world will enter and carry out a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here , they made it to enlarge the floor area and use high @-@ quality materials that pro@@ cure its luxurious advantage in the room .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and they are helping to create an emotional binding in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love you in electric sockets in the walls .
they are important but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square footage of a bit standard in something completely different .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this .
brothers strug@@ gling for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the biggest real estate imper@@ ien Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and business can be split .
Paul didn &apos;t move back to the family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the city .
following an agreement with her deceased father , Colin he has been described as &quot; main operators and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of business oil and Paul about one third .
an act of jurisdiction that this means that Colin property has valued at $ 316 million , and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of property and cash has proven itself as a trial point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by Colin proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by Colin proposed for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in an first affair in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin , how Paul claims that he was excluded .
Colin argue that this is not true , but doesn &apos;t cast Paul before , to manage some owners .
in an early monkeys , which was filed by Colin , he says he was hoping to join the battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with monkey v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , P@@ it@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her death husband Luigi had been Italian immigrants to run the dairy &apos;s bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they use security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood @-@ Li@@ egen@@ iness in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans@@ ary of the family in Colin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colin says that he started the West Bank when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , were hoping to pass their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in front of judgment , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of the De Lut@@ is Group , whereby Colin claimed that Mark was paid for 10 million dollars , and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Luke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as Mark , Paul &quot; says &quot; beyond the conditions of its financial separation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept himself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and following a biography in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took in contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our family name by the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote a letter to the judgment that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have hop@@ ed that Paul and I would like to fight in our current dispute , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hop@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue is solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media pre@@ st@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a reduced course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps white house , which he would like to repair , bad information , that come into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the employees that information should get around him - whether on paper or in stamp - because the president would get better decisions if he would get good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nostic makes sense but others are trying to count Tr@@ ump , to monitor his media activity .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship for television dates back to decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; if a candidate was offended because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former elec@@ toral advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Politi@@ co .
politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote a time that &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter is under control , according to six former elec@@ toral campaign officials , to ensure that its personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter is ever &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
maybe these campaigns were something that we do not know others - that tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets have not yet contain any more ignition .
we probably never know about the Twe@@ ets , the tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff were able to create it some times , anno@@ y@@ ance of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has to prevent it consistently , that tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y is calling .
a part of the problem is that people together in a White House which puts together out of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by making tr@@ ump material , that may bring their views from the world .
politics - very busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to provide more information on the President of strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump civil servants say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press releases , especially those with damaged , and that it arises out of how these originate from .
this happened at the end of February , when someone made a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Head Office of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a heap to be from Lec@@ ks &quot; at the White House .
even though Johnson banned healing permanently from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or expressed in the past , or re@@ vo@@ ke it in the past .
tr@@ ump read the article and began to inqu@@ ire at the staff of Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ smith added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; attempted to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that open ?
Kelly attempts to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove itself as a more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his pulse self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors still strive to influence .
this un@@ changeable factors make a wa@@ ys mission very difficult .

trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute trav@@ ellers on the base of war , which is one of the municipality in the confin@@ ed dit@@ ch , to rep@@ ay a field before their men &apos;s houses .
travelers have their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called &quot; a million@@ th row . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transp@@ orting , after they were pulled out only in May , without causing the tr@@ ench of excav@@ ated tr@@ ench in order to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ely group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ han@@ dic@@ apped to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ fortun@@ ate residents have the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; they went on Monday night , after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they have cast stones on the Pass@@ over .
the Council must be forced into action by pressing the implementation , since it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were moved in May there , and are now back again .
more arrived last night in the evening , probably more &quot; more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by being long under@@ transfers to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on the mountain@@ e@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my general meeting if the Council can &apos;t stop that . &quot;
a native that would not be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just have just seen the last round of this trav@@ ellers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the figures have been increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ m said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ am@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible .
in order to support our support collection , it is very important that as many local residents are using anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes Lu@@ ise .
the house at the gates of the city of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof with the then amb@@ ience of the company &apos;s amb@@ ience mbH about 30 000 nights per year and has also been lost through the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic numbers of refugees that came into the County , the hotel building was offered to the regional office as a collective accommodation , which was for controversial discussions .
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by the preparation of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but above all the city &apos;s Supreme Court Julian Oss@@ et@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties to the house at that time .
he should keep right .
the Group Lu@@ isen@@ Hotel with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ans bought the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin . again , it wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ans and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has already been built for longer period of construction container before the entrance , and when you enter the house , there will be clear what extensive renovation work will be done .
the so@@ ils were torn out , blan@@ kets on the part of dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs out of the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is much to do .
&quot; it is a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large accessible showers , the input area is converted , there will be new windows .
all that would be &quot; beautiful &quot; really &quot; to become , just like Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
it is not positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but is already emphas@@ ised on a up@@ scale city level .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms spread wide , explained Sch@@ erer further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ists , groups or business people are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause has led him , so sh@@ er .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to be exact .
just under a million euro , he calcul@@ ates .
the outside plants are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there will be a large terrace , which will be publicly accessible from the restaurant .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : US Special En@@ em@@ ler sets a Grand Jury
in the Russia affair by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , a special fund Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have used a so @-@ called Grand jury .
the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to the same thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper mentioned the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fy its investigations .
CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there have already been the first advance of the Gre@@ mi@@ xes in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps El@@ derly son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin since long , targeted targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were differences between tr@@ um@@ ps elec@@ toral team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are supposed to be held in the election campaign as advisor of the Republi@@ can .
according to report , Mu@@ eller received more and more dr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
the Washington Post , &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o was personally taken into the center and in@@ gest@@ ure , whether the President in the course of the affair had possibly dis@@ gu@@ ised the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide whether the evidence is to be charged .
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called counts of the Prosec@@ ution .
mostly they will be switched on if they are larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always closed behind the closed doors .
the board can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to download people under the oath by people .
according to the CN@@ N , CN@@ N have already been issued to spin around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement , named it in the report .
Moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also Tr@@ um@@ ps Consult@@ ant and mother @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his father &apos;s election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the conversation .
right @-@ right words on Thursday evening in the US television that the translation shows that Mu@@ eller should not leave in his work , and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it must not be forced that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the obj@@ ection of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia , in order to present Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign to his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme give the democr@@ ats a possibility to feel &quot; well , because they have nothing else to talk about that they can speak . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement that was ignor@@ ant of a Grand jury .
but this is normally working in secret agents , but he emphas@@ ised .
the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special fund on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times , that not against the President .
you have no reason to assume that something has changed in it , he called it in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this ro@@ uting , the accus@@ ation against tr@@ ump had become no@@ isy , he wanted to han@@ dic@@ ate justice .
com@@ ey said in June before a Sen@@ ats@@ Committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him to ask for an investigation of the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under large print due to the examination .
according to the U.S. media , the White House gathered the White House material against the speci@@ als and its employees .
that solved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
unlike an independent special exec@@ utives of the Congress such as in the Water@@ gate affair the President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has fired a position in which he could be fired in theo@@ reti@@ cally at the president of the Ministry of Justice .
several trans@@ formers of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators were submitted to the legisl@@ ature on Thursday , after which the special fund could not be dismissed so easy .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the West Arctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg was removed from the scar@@ city of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
the Zar@@ cer@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research was divided on Wednesday .
the more than a trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres are now driven out to the north and become probably two or three years until he was melted .
it is available with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest iron ore which researchers have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people is not of him .
in how far the climate change has played a role in the crash of ice , it is un@@ clear to research .
in total , there have been a series of unusual con@@ du@@ es in the region since around 30 years in the region , writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a Fak@@ uma .
in opinion of many researchers , this could be combined with global warming .
now the broken col@@ oss has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is growing always further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i was the equilibrium of wax and break off some years ago .
a complete fe@@ ather is to be broken down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some evidence that Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is at risk , because the front edge has never pulled so far as far as at present .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate runs under tension and can be broken down , if one piece of a piece of key .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases sea level as sea level , since they swim in water so much water as it arises after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the fe@@ eder indicate that gl@@ aci@@ ers can reach the sea directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small size , the British research project writes to the Antar@@ ctic research project ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to the A@@ WI @-@ C , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest archipelago in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
the distance from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres .
there it breaks periodi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though it is natural , and we don &apos;t have any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign comes into a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most far retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is re @-@ rise again or fall again in the long term , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researcher did not bring this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , so in the past decades , there are very many sk@@ el@@ ves of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula in recent decades .
this long Zi@@ p of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
according to data of the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have seen in the past 50 years and war@@ med around three degrees , to the areas where the temperature of the fastest increases .
CD@@ U wants to de@@ br@@ if the personnel
because it is getting more difficult to occupy freely , the CD@@ U , from the Emplo@@ yers Association , to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k day has 41 new jobs in administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
there were around 620 applicants for the number of places to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lack personnel to cope with the Asc@@ ended Requi@@ re@@ ments and Tas@@ ks .
currently , there are currently 50 positions in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with F@@ DP and U@@ WG together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and to join the expert angel in administration .
in accordance with the desire of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term requirements of professionals , but on the future of application of the application , it says .
the overall concept should approach to inside and outside , concrete measures for trans@@ formers and include a training offensive , CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this can be heard even after a good approach .
since the circle has it to do with personal problems , which one knew not earlier .
other cities advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the address is from a regular &quot; competition of public employer . &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age due to the service occurs .
so the highest time to acting , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
however , Klaus @-@ Dieter people , Fra@@ ction of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application .
he had long been a surprise in the chal@@ k for a f@@ ist thick surprise when he posed the personnel cost @-@ covering public in question and the remaining parties .
people want to be reviewed all the possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not able to satisfy a satisfactory solution here , the county government should strive with the unions - maybe even in cooperation with the circular cities - a skin tariff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the CD@@ U , the employees and officials tried to pay better than the tariff for Public Service actually .
the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , increases or more money if one changes to a higher level , based on professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms were to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ utes protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO @-@ migrants mig@@ raine
Italy has NGOs that use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they may not continue to keep up new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new Code of Con@@ duct , it is difficult to see how to continue working &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ n@@ itis had a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German Relief organization &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their crew had worked together with men &apos;s hands , which ligh@@ tened the illegal immigration .
the auxiliary organisation , which only has been in operation for one year , refused to sell himself to the Italian State an@@ wal@@ ts Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us it is the salvation of the human life our top priority . so we really sorry that we can operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in a statement about the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all claims that are currently raised , only after we all have collected information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; young R@@ ettet &apos; , supervised by I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew of infl@@ atable migrants will take aboard , which can be delivered directly from human hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred , supposedly , only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the Prosecutor , its content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue rates in zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives is taking away .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have been on board mainly an Italian police officer , who supervised their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and emergency inserts , have so far been prepared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary but acceptable , as they were no &quot; essential amendments or Dis@@ abilities &quot; to their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize @-@ awarded Organisation for Do@@ ctors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the ambul@@ ance measures had strongly declined in the last weeks , to strengthen the efforts to strengthen Libyan Coast Guard and the collaboration with the local citizen .
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister .
he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month &apos;s economic development initiatives and with Che@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ ings B@@ iker , the &quot; Berliner out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Sea , to enjoy four days of tri@@ mmer and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this .

the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome Extra .
the first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of Micha@@ el@@ ons@@ at home on D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed the observation points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the pe@@ eled forest and the pre @-@ bearing levels .
there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ ples .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Pop@@ ular Wur@@ st@@ markt .

console instead of lawn - in the Bundesliga it is suitable for E @-@ Sport
sitting the Sport @-@ Stars in future with computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating with wind and weather about the stadium to fight ?
Fak@@ t is : E @-@ Sport has long been become a serious business , to a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high standards included .
they have also recognized the first national levels of the League , which are increasingly being committed in this area .
the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; we hope to in@@ spire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure that there will be a few clubs on that train . &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the Gam@@ er hosted several clubs on each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile been an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds apart that the young people still go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : they attempted to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with celebr@@ ity E @-@ athletes , one could be present online far more often on these markets , as only once per year to send the federal state to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or just put the FIFA Simulation of FIFA on competition level .
long ago , how in normal sport also , Li@@ gen established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian 2006 , E @-@ Sports is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a correct sports ?
for many , the idea is safe ordinary .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long been dealt with the question .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions , which one can find in classic sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress actions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
furthermore , cogn@@ itive abilities , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response ability .
professional gam@@ er should not only exercise on the console but also to exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rob@@ bers also looks like problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ oping will always be more a subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult through online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientists investigate the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are internationally traveling , this is like a major global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Under@@ entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 there were 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years sales revenues should be 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga it is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far away from the other established sports like hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
international countries are already continuing many countries .
large markets are Asia and the United States , where the former basketball ho@@ op Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez take part in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ betting party Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe do something like that .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as instruction , the rob@@ bers said .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football first @-@ line ten@@ ds have been obliged to establish a E @-@ Sports Department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany left behind &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains .
to exp@@ ire only in nost@@ al@@ gia , and to clari@@ fy the old times , this is no longer enough .
it is therefore to keep the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time order the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one to hold that only when football remains so , as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , Conrad Roy had to turn to suicide .
a wife of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend by texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind G@@ ap@@ ers and five years were exposed to local currency .
he was sentenced to life in June by Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy promised on Thursday at hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ tri@@ cky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free until his vocation .
it was confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives went to argue that both of them and Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ ic disease .
in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter arose with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards in the eyes , when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; she said the State of State .
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has taken over responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney at law said it was a &quot; horri@@ fic circum@@ stance , which they are totally p@@ iti@@ ed . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , didn &apos;t find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their cler@@ gy disease have a significant influence on their do@@ ings . &quot;
a public prosecutor has read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy who possessed it &quot; no day , in whom I did not use the loss of my beloved Son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we shall bear for the eternity of us , for his sisters there , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that she will never be persecuted by knowledge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will never be able to participate in their brother &apos;s wedding or a t@@ ante for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not more this single person , with whom I had together since my birth every day is a pain , which I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal note of precision , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in a vehicle from a carbon mon@@ oxide .
the case passed national attention to the following Car@@ ters text , that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hanging down , spring from a building , ste@@ er yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent them in two weeks before his death , while he was with his family in vacation .
in the eyes before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; All that you must do is to enter the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought out attention through the death of Roy , ordered that they should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few , the Carter Defense belonged to Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 due to murder of their British co @-@ resident in Italy before being acquitted two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was able to run at the Audi Cup as captain , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern is a great season with the Con@@ figuration Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not prevail .
something else was there on his seat in the cabin , which looked like Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the additional garment was very small , very small .
but as far as wide and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , there was no Philipp L@@ ame and also not a Manuel New York , he made his shared bin@@ ge to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not have announced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ figuration Cup winner was back after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of Coach I was able to interpret it so .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was one of the young professionals , de@@ but@@ ant and just taken out of the holiday offered by professionals @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he has chosen .
in loving kindness , the sugar is distributed among those who want to hold a lot of neutral that you want to keep in La@@ une .
who thus has been chosen to compete for the inheritance of L@@ ame , a small extra motivation can only be used .
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what one wants to take over responsibility as a player . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old served as Mini @-@ L@@ ame on the field .
on the right behind , that &apos;s now its position , the white binding on the arm did you rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this start@@ up report as the one who can take the ruin of the best in your hand .
he gave instructions to direct the un@@ divided tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy himself .
Vid@@ al therefore , with his missing fitness to play ( foldable ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches so that out devils come out to the achievements of Asia &apos;s journey ( also only conditioned ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus refused to drop out in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ kot .
that after all , it was very good .
in addition to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y ran before the bri@@ gade on both ag@@ ated sovereign .
the well @-@ known Napole@@ i @-@ storm did very difficult , in addition , sw@@ ole tried to have a few times in the game construction .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave fact that the result was &quot; not so as we hop@@ ed ourselves . &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary performance in the debut .
playing shift , temp@@ o : &quot; for this style , I was even fet@@ ched . &quot;
as usual , this Bayern @-@ World is still used for the new v@@ int@@ ages , one looked at the game to the game .
for example , Rud@@ y gave not one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cris@@ y statements in the back of his new players .
there he listened from Sü@@ le an interesting set : &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I already noticed .
with Bayern you simply needs to win any game . &quot;
after all , he must no longer teach the New Testament .

companies satisfied with Rhineland @-@ pe@@ eled ministers : Wirtschaft im Wis@@ sings temp@@ o
it was often insufficient , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister for Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Finance Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and t@@ ins at the same time the old Minist@@ ries .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ on all blocks . &quot;
the largest kit@@ ten sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the bridge on the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now on the priority list of the country .
in this year , the Ministry hopes for an planning process , until 2021 , the construction is to be right .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ption Trier , which stands on the proposed demand of the Federal Convention .
the aim is to take operation the route in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial positions in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees them a sign for the regional but international competing company .
the Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) in Trier is stim@@ ulated by Wis@@ sing , with the wine a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German Wine exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to start a company dedicated to the Chamber of Commerce .
the Trier Trial Chamber Trier looks in the new Master bonus to an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young apprentices , says Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
provided is a premium of 1000 Euro for the constitu@@ ent master test and 2500 euros when graduates within ten years after the master@@ ing training .
but the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction would quickly create facts , at the same time , it says the country in the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , principal managing director of the Chamber of Commerce Trier .
of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing , who want to set mobility are occupied only 29 places so far .
the Chamber of Commerce is required to forgive more orders to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the host interface , the country investing in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of regional roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept in the country , as it wants to fix the Hung@@ arians angel in the region .
that is also the previous full range of broad@@ band in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had only rated power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about mol@@ dy Internet connections and di@@ ps .
ex @-@ economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of the policy and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power plant Pro Wind .
the Gre@@ ke Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they had already taken the field after four months .
Audi should change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - an auto producer is confron@@ ted with a counter @-@ reaction .
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more intelligent options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and based on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to feature or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler was announced on Tuesday to modify it three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
neither of the companies described the sub@@ missions as the recall .
European autom@@ akers supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules of carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines , apply as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , systems to neutr@@ alize the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles designed to install diesel vehicles , also assume that it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful auto@@ companies and signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error from Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called off @-@ old devices that could be regulated to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees have been indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former director of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and could be put in court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , after the authorities have installed a system installed to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States , has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could lead Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer delivers proportional to the profit of Volkswagen by Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ n@@ oses and the laugh@@ ter against the suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most published carto@@ ons @-@ cartoon , the Kn@@ oll@@ n@@ oses of his figures are trademarks .
also with 85 in Argentina , the Argentin@@ ian is still working on a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he fell among others as a character cards for lucky cards - what was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happy day in my professional life was the day when in my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded him at the end of the 60 &apos;s breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris &quot; and then in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
and again the artist was in@@ spire and inspired by the artists .
big , un@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figur@@ ines surrounding drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
according to the early morning he is still sitting on the animation , still works almost ten hours a day .
more calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush @-@ animals and clo@@ cks are still going to be spread much spread throughout the world .
he has been working on a animation film and a TV series with its figures for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ es animal in its drawings - which has a thousands of end@@ anger than counter player .
for the first time , his figures speak to the 3D movie that should come to the chin @-@ on wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they are saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script is not written by him .
therefore he reli@@ es on the TV series , which , as its original drawings , is produced .
la@@ ven@@ der out of the Provence &apos;s climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the de@@ struc@@ tive conditions and due to the diseases transferred to insects , which scientists and farmers attemp@@ ting to find solutions to find solutions , big heada@@ ches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert for agricultural research institutes C@@ RI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant had been exposed to impacts of climate change in the past years , and much more in the autumn .
this has impact on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ des , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ists , it is also very asked for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
for the solutions that are considered , a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spray of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties which are resistant to dry @-@ resistant .

the assassination of an journalists under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce will usually meet on Wedn@@ esdays in order to check its plans for the latest chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ disturbed drugs .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about safety .
it has been told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
discuss two high @-@ ranking journalists , what a safer place : they should take their children with the office that were in 2009 the goal of a attack with gren@@ ades , or let them be at home .
security professionals have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ ality , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ter to propose names for every column - no evidence is necessary to make use and abdom@@ inal conditions .
there are drug mu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand in the base of the government or the cart@@ el , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico .
there is no rest break from violence , and during all the land the cor@@ p@@ ses , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto died in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 stand after attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states .
among the latter you can be ed@@ itors and their In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence becomes low , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , pointing at the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ter in the thirty years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ter discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a special General Assembly was erected in order to process the cases of journalists , it was initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the committee for the protection of journalists .
as with thousands of mur@@ ders , who are associated with drug traff@@ icking and organis@@ ational crimes every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers are only rarely asked in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still consist of treatment to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are still in the east and even though the terrain is now s@@ lan@@ ter@@ nal .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without righteousness , the meeting on the discussion of security is little benefits , I@@ bar@@ ra says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stup@@ id , my time in this workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we know not the Why , we miss everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he was able to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla on two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot at him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelfth river . &quot;
the shooter drove away in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the theme of Val@@ dez , there is virtually nothing but silence .
if Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extradition into the United States in January had become one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ lements of the country since ri@@ val@@ isation fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people can be shot on the road or that the gra@@ ve@@ yard is full of injured , two @-@ story mouse on drugs that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget it for a minute that there is a state of the &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el control of coastal towns with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ jor@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the fault that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
in February , in February the publication of a interview with the Damas@@ c@@ eption of a Damas@@ c@@ ary map fra@@ ctions held in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this release may off@@ end the sons suspected , that power members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to force after the sei@@ z@@ ure of a different newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived , that his friends and colleagues did not feel that he would always be there .
he served as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he was joined with five colleagues to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter the noise of poison , &quot; said Bo@@ jor@@ am .
at the time the newspaper had served a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honour@@ able coverage , and the turnover and advertising took place .
repor@@ ter loved it , hard tre@@ ats without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories , which no one vent@@ ured for anything else .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for its coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists in the persecution of Mexican drug history , where she always led them .
he voluntarily sur@@ rendered to him that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J @-@ Award .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in the past October .
&quot; you must take over the task that falls as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done so much dead ? why did you not tell what happened before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez , the Ri@@ y@@ ce team , Val@@ dez , who could curse the fun , who was like a harbour worker , who was gener@@ ously with U@@ mar@@ ines and advice , a teacher who knew how one survived .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and sit down there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death has also forced them to ask their own approach to question as they can do their work in the best and remain in the life .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home start and landing ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ jor@@ am .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ sur and self catering .
trust his own inst@@ inctive .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , keep away from it .
the trouble is said the Editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; scent is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more , as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ells , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape has constantly changed .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were suddenly no mobile phones . days earlier , Spy@@ ware that is exclusively sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in the shade , two polic@@ emen sought refuge from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were asked by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in Pur@@ im , some of the repor@@ ter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , which the governor had committed itself as non @-@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it has been months since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug bound is under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has left on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , concentrated on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group of which led in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about it , who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when everyone knows that everyone in the city know : that the restaurant is a favorite restaurant of drugs and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who ruled the rule of a political party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several Pr@@ i governors were charged because of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this locality , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; was one of a military attack .
just a few months earlier , the readers had considered the colum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body handle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communic@@ ating with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage space for signs and stick@@ ers who prot@@ ested against the mur@@ ders of journalists because the staff has never expected something else : activists in the name of the press .
Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez was a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and civil servants say based on DNA testing that it is its .
in all the country , journalists were stronger , by being organised in organized prot@@ agon@@ ists &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on sal@@ aries and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ jor@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez &apos;s Justice .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to send journalists and bring them to the truth , because they have said the truth .
she has since then asked that the government is divided again , because it wor@@ ried about that her rage has violated its object .
Val@@ dez had been repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes , involved in the government officials and a uniform corporation . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ter will not only be put on drugs , but also on orders of politi@@ cian and security forces that are using the organised crime under a blan@@ ket .
the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists and officials in the past year .
&quot; in Mexico , you know because they want to hold the mouth , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said . &quot;
obviously the mor@@ de have a horri@@ fic effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ inist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that supposedly signed by the Z@@ au cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
one computer keyboard and headphones are next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo for the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z set up publicly on the drug card with a leading article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states , or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the roads and look for haz@@ ards .
and sometimes they ch@@ ased out , according to the photographer Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa who was in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to continue and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , gives the drug traff@@ icking in the drug .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the ed@@ itors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting in front of the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , as at once all her phones began to sum@@ s .
a number of shooting paintings with band EQ and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued on how it was promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the border line you have published the news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens close to - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ jor@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , holding the guard to see if they were in will@@ ing@@ ness .
if they were all afraid , they showed it not .
under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for all sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ jor@@ am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day was assassin@@ ated in Javier , the intern@@ ships asked me to send them to the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to turn his enemies .
at the first glance it looks like a statue , if a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain workers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa , Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even determine that his gre@@ ed skin of red@@ dish Braun was - and they said they would have had something from a &quot; dis@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report published in the magazine &quot; current Biology &quot; received him as &quot; the sour@@ ced din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ lasting condition , researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red vegetable ni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he died on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , green .
he met on something that seemed to the surrounding rocks on the square , and decided to see more precise .
the Fos@@ sil discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creation is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of knowledge as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers found that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , although it is covered with arm@@ ament , and re@@ sembles a converting tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ e@@ aters din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage in order to hide themselves off pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ atro@@ op@@ ic technology that is used as a counter @-@ proof , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix up in its surroundings and to sof@@ ten its enemies , experts say that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has first made head@@ lines in May and is now seeing the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have studied the wild animal , and there were Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli , after the museum ste@@ amer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ rests on its body .
they discovered the Con@@ ter@@ ns , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the console is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far the animals live today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of sufficient pressure by the din@@ osau@@ rs Din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the con@@ frontation was bene@@ fici@@ ent as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the Con@@ ter@@ ns - think of R@@ ehe , Zeb@@ ras or belts - are much smaller and hurt as a prey , which indicates that this cam@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ors on a massive , strong din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have been to have been the chal@@ ice age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown Brown &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r red was brown .
scientists continue to investigate the animal in references over his life , including his gener@@ alized Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes , to find out what it did as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs when he died , was moved into a river and went out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor .
at that time , Alberta was so warm as a southern side today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much beyond than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because he is completely covered with con@@ gr@@ ated skin , but also in three dimensions , the original form of the animal ret@@ ains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown Brown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly as in the early chal@@ k period .
you don &apos;t need a lot of fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is on the sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res din@@ osau@@ r , who stood on two legs , the earth passed through .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest insights in the journal current Biology appear to believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was removed after the death in the sea and was m@@ apped in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk , on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , green .
according to the museum , it is the most preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips on his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ cre@@ ted plant was flooded through the western Canada , until a flooded river was flooded .
but the underwater feeding of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his armour in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin will still cover hol@@ ur@@ ge plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , this is such a level of preser@@ ving as much as a profit in lottery .
the more I see it , the more it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin cover still the hol@@ lows of the skin which carry the skull of the beast .
his right front foot is located on his side , its five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many clubs
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass break .
there are numerous Ver@@ sions , miles long st@@ ems from - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , around 20 people have been injured in the late afternoon afternoon .
according to the first data of the police were between 5 pm between the connecting sites Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 cars , among them probably also trucks .
there are no indications about the exact number of the injured persons .
it &apos;s easy to take light to medium injuries , said one police station .
a big event for rescue cars was at the accident of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , some ten kilometres of retreat was in retreat .
like a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter , it came also on the way to massive Dis@@ abilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade not@@ ched itself the characteristics of the vehicle manufacturer , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock the second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
in doing so it was a coll@@ ision between a car leader and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that has experienced almost every time : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or it is deeper into his work and has just a great thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the cur@@ ator and wake up an uns@@ cre@@ st , or breaks the driver in the middle of the work@@ flow .
check @-@ in control .
but times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently working @-@ free travel control .
it simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken his place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; come the offer , we are coming from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called the train de@@ valuation of the car without the workers .
in order to ut@@ ilize the requirements , some conditions have to be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what we have to do in most of the passengers .
it must also be purchased via the train , the DB Navigator , which is why the most comfortable way of the ticket is .
and most recently you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works in the train , calling the ticket &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button appears then a button to the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train leaders received their mobile devices a message that chassis X is located in the train and the booked seat field Y has taken place .
the train conductor of the board control at Square Y knows that there is a passenger with already designed online ticket .
so you can continue to keep further , keep further silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two benefits : one for the customer , one for train - what is to take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would like to travel without ticket control thanks to our train passport personnel , check in the DB Navigator just one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables passengers to create their journey time in the train of personal details , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board from DB remote transport .
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
those often breaks , white , that in addition to del@@ ays and missed trains , belong to the greatest anno@@ ys .
for often , in any case , in any case , one of the travelling time does not take all documents that you need to use online tickets .
either the credit card or the number of identity card is missing or otherwise a document must be given .
the consequence are endless discussions between train leaders and driving licence , which leads to worse sen@@ timent in the evenings or large space and del@@ ays at the end time takes time to worry about other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also only on connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how one activ@@ ist came to study the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken up to their core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , the camp sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , rented it and sc@@ roll by Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled about a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child , and still on the streets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since no one had posted information on her feed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly wor@@ shi@@ ped on their Tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old man who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ per body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was for them and her fellowship is nothing new .
it embar@@ ked on her mobile phone later , in order to return to Twe@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons Police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ate dog .
in another video , she said that a different policy is his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , saying , &quot; I will kill you all ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell ten@@ ds to their testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and that we are typical . &quot;
at that moment , I felt bl@@ am@@ ous .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she brought her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in cinemas from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest@@ ing , the strength and strength , the strength and resistance of resistance , which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who bore a cau@@ lif@@ ter and a matching crown , brought to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times in the morning &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we now go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it , and it will be drawn up .
it has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even though I have lucky enough to give you a experience , in which they personally experienced a de@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would give you a bad service , to keep them far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was in a camp area when the activ@@ ist was waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and hal@@ ted them to pass demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed , after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated as a student at the University of Missouri by St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Association , focused on Es@@ sen@@ sus of justice and health im@@ ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah &apos;s Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her camera of Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to merely document &quot; what happened .
a question came Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; want to document , or tries to find a story that you can get out ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ sis was nourished by countless cases of people , often from white - in a community that benef@@ ited from her pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and grew up , their votes were not cent@@ ered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for its acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt @-@ occup@@ ants .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project closer , along with six other locals , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets followed ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns vom@@ iting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main cause for me as these people are represented , as I will be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim was to focus on fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not a Messiah guide , but for a community which comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most reve@@ aling participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls live , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain level of injuries in this work and the human dig@@ iti@@ zation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls has repeatedly repeated the role of the black fla@@ w@@ ls in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter Movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which according to the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women in leadership positions have carried out the movement altogether &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling to different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , sw@@ ing@@ ed women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
the fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; the movement is really kept by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it consists of that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a ground@@ breaking type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the he@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who ra@@ ged this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no co@@ incidence , although it was in front of the front , because with a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , sw@@ am woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy by the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the message cameras have long since disappeared in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , but the r@@ ass@@ al connections between the community and the police continue to continue .
Fer@@ rell is on currency for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ ade of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the social policy of the area that they call her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she rang again to a song , and she has committed to this memorial for three years ago in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on on the street .
&quot; it is our obligation to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and assist .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV reader discuss the bit gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bit Galerie moves the people , although they are not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian area has been split up since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold leaves the topic hardly any one .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the theme is discussed .
while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; that would be real @-@ class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ occupy ) or quite simple : &quot; Or@@ w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the temp@@ ter states that there will be a gallery more customers to the city , of which also the other shops will benefit , the enemy will fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed .
added : the gallery is located exactly on the property , on which the farms market stands , in which 13 Directors will offer their products .
the construction works will be completed with the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery Mach@@ er want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been selling nearly weekly in the farms market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land women are always happy again .
also the but@@ cher we discovered for us .
we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also that too .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent .
however , this is likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what &apos;s shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , drug or supermarkets : I find the su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
of which there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years .
since there are not even a regular weekly market , it is the more important that us get at least the market hall .
because all the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly from the producers and is ob@@ serving clean .
as you can see , shop transactions will be rented in a shopping mall only of larger firms , for rent is often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special stores are almost no longer and what is still left , then will disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall fit for me not .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farms market during construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even when the bit gallery is actually coming .
or is it possible to drive the gh@@ ost bit gallery before , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s simply not working .
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market place , yes , thanks to the mad many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the peas@@ an@@ try tr@@ ams will disappear again , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , that almost un@@ mistak@@ ably - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from Wan@@ gen @-@ T@@ up@@ far and Hair Pieces that you have been sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former Intelligence Analy@@ zer has served a 35 @-@ year @-@ old sentence after they publicly put diplomatic news about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ emb@@ ley ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was converted into technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ ition and a rep@@ ell@@ ent dis@@ sidents whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he was only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from Mann@@ ing , like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could not only be created for the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many wise men , as they can be interpreted and the in@@ firm@@ ament Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been speaking to the identification of woman as wife , was condemned in 2013 because of 20 acquisitions , including six violations of the sp@@ y law , computer was and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits clearly on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ el@@ bl@@ onde with which it was associated with .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg arrived just from the great success of their 2012 @-@ Project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic ar@@ te@@ facts such as cigarette m@@ um@@ bs and chew@@ ing g@@ um , extracted from the waste to produce a picture of how these people can look like .
that was the time when it received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg declared a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
and she could not visit this time , and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were sent to un@@ equal letters that had several letters in the course of two years .
they called even one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ lied images , &quot; which would be a future predic@@ table in which the President of Chel@@ em would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama would actually only be a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing was sentenced to seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also at the opening of the exhibition slightly deep and Star@@ kes , because Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against transit forces to find new , twe@@ aks to find the rigid circuits , which he should actually fix , continue to fl@@ aming .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange Tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen in a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( that &quot; i &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic shred@@ der , the basis of gender , breed , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ cal DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of C@@ s and Gs and As in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , with the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ glut@@ ot@@ id after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia of the artist ) , how remark@@ ably similar , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; what people will have hop@@ efully take away that our gene doesn &apos;t take care of what we are , and how to sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tively they are , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , trace Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a private room , is a page from the top mentioned com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as they appear in hand @-@ free @-@ free ef@@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hand of the discipl@@ ines of the United States , like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they ch@@ ill your word , they have won &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia .
&quot; I can still see ge@@ ese , if I don &apos;t talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was predicted in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of the mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ as , as hor@@ des of protest@@ ants .
this was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ points were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human being , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said by the portraits . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like a mass movement , like the movement described behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- Professor of the University of North@@ western and a employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide human hunt is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which was considered as susp@@ ects in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with killing injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ ws ( 56 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ ts were exhibited for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , like the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a warning system was written by the police authority in Chicago , that the body was discovered on 27 July .
civil servants received a call , came to the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victims with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stig@@ che as murder while police explo@@ ded according to the two susp@@ ects , for civil servants .
since 2007 La@@ ws has been a full professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ism , the Vice @-@ President of the University of Economics , said in an e @-@ mail declaration that La@@ ws must be judged now and was excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which by the competent authorities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North@@ western University co@@ operates on this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cub@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is senior Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we were in contact with the police in Great Britain and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way to help . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want that he turned to himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he challenge the susp@@ ects , to put the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of her position , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help ensure the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received an av@@ enger tip that happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ws and War@@ ren were in the building .

the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the op@@ ort and resear@@ ched a variety of motives , including a possible domestic occurrence . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian vi@@ vi@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er vit@@ ality Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) was implemented .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfil@@ ment of the schedule of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA @-@ timet@@ able has been updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA plans to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA , and recently published on the site of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything about the event for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future . &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the results of adopted by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to the alleged state sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport .
in regards to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has been con@@ founded a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not admit something , what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os Wor@@ ked words with those of vit@@ ality Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v Problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , then added : &quot; we have been repeated that the report distri@@ butes positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ as by the WA@@ DA of the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ checks in Russia .
however , it was permitted to plan testing and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the main building of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved into the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your companies not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Deli@@ ver@@ t wanted to measure the luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - deceit@@ ful .
and even if you promised An@@ chor@@ us , some workers did not grie@@ ve the process .
&quot; there was simply never consist@@ ency and Ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tivity &quot; said deliver@@ t , who run the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .
she called people from the outside .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ ter , to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licens@@ ing of software which has the specific purpose of measurement of employees , it allows companies to do surveys , special@@ izing groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases a Whi@@ st@@ le@@ mere allow to handle the C @-@ suite exec@@ utives and turn them directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; she said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tool is used to measure staff members .
salvation said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel with G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows most of the complaints , and which have low access results - so that you can drill .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so you do not have the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee has published a blog post office that describes a environment of Bel@@ bo@@ ilers , in the ones who have spoken is pen@@ alised .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ ke@@ ative business possibility .
the Global Governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , according to the financial technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent un@@ stable behavior and to recognize , saw an increase in interest and activity beginning in the middle of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
L@@ ber has recently registered as clients .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent company makes custom @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ se &quot; pol@@ ls , confi@@ dential answers to real time and watch the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with the employee s@@ lugg@@ ish behavior .
and if the main business leader is included , complaints can go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ul@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and Managing Director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ical , it may experience precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employees of workers and complaints , said qu@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 associates and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and a simple way to have their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a salary wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail to the headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an en@@ act and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ a General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to pursue complaints from employees .
now , as the company Conver@@ cent has problems , problems which were sitting by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or countries - how discrimination , ins@@ ult , or un@@ lau@@ er inter@@ ns have been identified and addressed .
&quot; I can look closer to this integer , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; says Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment laws . &quot;
the company began to take eth@@ ics , assets and employees in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of eth@@ ical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company knew that they could not prevent the dirty pl@@ under@@ wear online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitoring the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and simpli@@ fy the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the venture capital investors who both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , bringing the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and earned its total financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is an increasing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect from their jobs more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to make their voices , and that the work you want to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and the E@@ ye@@ e Experience , &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , who uses both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites when her portfolio companies run well . companies run well , when employees are working and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics support third parties agree to increase commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if there &apos;s no action to take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have a anticip@@ ation that a change is in the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can ch@@ ase dis@@ appo@@ intments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to be very pleased to collect data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you are not going to follow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have ye really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of about it ?
and who does not take care of why ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who is now running a monthly employee pol@@ ls , was able to run measures on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so is salvation .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organise several teams within the company &apos;s decision and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the staff , and it hopes that a long view of workers in a industry leads to a better binding of workers in a sector .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose human beings , &quot; says Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose human , you lose clients .
and if you lose clients , you will lose businesses .
the N@@ CA@@ A remov@@ es the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers have on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot upper parts and show the back full swe@@ at from the first day of the workout camp .
for a good part of the team , these unt@@ ou@@ ched minutes a lunch break .
players who are enrolled to the summer courses are returned after the three @-@ hour practice after their final test before they return to the water Football Center on the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a genuine T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; she said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it actually prolon@@ gs her days - at least until the final on Friday .
that is why the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 , to meet the players fully @-@ packed cont@@ ests .
compromise between the two days is more than a day when the brood @-@ ins start the start of the Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are to keep working in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the form@@ ations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ p@@ ains the rule of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add a further point for the multiple of the players .
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on it , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they just pressed it , they have plac@@ ements on , they are great people .
I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it is really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which has been made out of a adjacent parking area and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of elevated class , which has already been extended with foot in a tor@@ rent . no easy task will be .
brood @-@ players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free of season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ brought to think that people rent a room there , and then set aside a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have a video from a exercise , it &apos;s a rather good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I &apos;m not doing so much too big for me .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against f@@ ake messages .
Facebook wants to send any more potential article with Fal@@ ken@@ over of third parties and their results under the original contribution , then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat F@@ ake News .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods to detect potential folders and send them to the fact that may show the results of the fact that may be displayed from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , of which many believed that it also affects the US presidential election 2016 .
the problem is also turned into a major political theme , whereby the French voters allegedly flooded the Presi@@ dential elections in May with false stories , and Germany does not support a plan , after the social media networks , if it is not able to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German that , in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of new facts review will be started .
&quot; in addition to knowledge , what stories from Fak@@ ten@@ over@@ far third parties will want to meet more context to make well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook messages in one blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be able to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related Articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze @-@ music video and was hat@@ ch for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbul@@ ent history of its hom@@ ely seat in the Be@@ l River Valley in Kent and is now available for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of somebody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ h@@ one accord .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page of a letter so that he was written by a double bed in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters smell like smoke ; for at that time , a fire was kindled because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the od@@ or has a effect , as he himself would be .
Ah , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so with ancient papers that it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; to be honest : I have a little over@@ valued &quot; ) it seems to be nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ast@@ er@@ ous hy@@ mes were spent on walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the tr@@ ench .
he emigrated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape couples , gar@@ dener , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night , he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received its full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the staff just started to worry about the archive which he said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it onto the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps , who had said : &quot; it could mean that land resi@@ sts would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families .
guys , let everything go to go ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter a wider basis in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man , who left the newly built castle to join the peasant revol@@ t of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar which occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peasant class began in this area and I thought , a rebellion was a good start .
perhaps are the two linked together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Jesu@@ it seven years during the British Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell dating back to the 18th century , having filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the men seemed to be a fitting of sound , always to spend their debts and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men qu@@ ests their debt crises , by giving the rich old women - I imagine her as a heap of good @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advert@@ ise her@@ nia . &quot;
after the end of its approach in the castle , Rho@@ des is in search of other unique write experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness of a com@@ ic Roman on E@@ di@@ cler@@ ks behind it , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been returned from nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Ah , now I have to be finished again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign started : covered over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the finishing of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , the Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team by Nelson Art@@ z hold the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August , it should be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of this promotion has been on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not think this ( of course ! ) not really &quot; write them on their yesterday un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention . &quot;
and to make it clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
basically , we are the strong conviction that we know as a bathroom of Hon@@ or to know the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city very well . &quot;
at the action , there will go more than &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means continue .
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the town an un@@ mistak@@ able daily basis . &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honnef allows a medium @-@ fold amount to cost its new roof brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the Army
every year in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) and transported to the officer cor@@ ps .
thus also this week .
on the first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is a routine in the Turkish forces a year after the passover .
the session did not take place more in the buildings of the Chief of Staff , as previously , but in the minist@@ erial seat of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of Government , the five runner @-@ up , as well as the Minister of Defence , Interior , justice and foreign office .
so the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the transition .
the government re@@ pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commission@@ er of the army , the air force and the navy were removed .
since the failed coup , the State of State Erdo@@ gan , 169 of the 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which sees the Erdo@@ gan as a wire of the P@@ utsch@@ er .
more than 486 people , who have been involved immediately on the pilot attempt , is negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had referred to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine joint &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan run the army really in the handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ ad@@ hagen &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff of the Army , it is due to an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which amongst others were manifest in the re@@ vocation of the head of heada@@ ches for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the large cleaning service at the army and security forces go on , anyway .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan led another 7@@ 395 officials , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed to be , when Erdo@@ gan run the military .
the gener@@ als are so@@ oner than the actual masters of the country .
their role was gu@@ ardi@@ ans three times on appeal to the gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan wrote the power of the military step by step , not least of their calling on the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erdo@@ gan t@@ ine wrote a target of the forces of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; named officer who sought for asylum from persecution in foreign countries asylum from persecution abroad in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it meets this , NATO could not leave NATO &apos;s cold .
so , in the alliance , there is a doubt about the cleaning of the Turkish army in the alliance .
the managers and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says Nato @-@ diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he sees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , str@@ ingent regulations for the visa approval of visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will decrease poverty , saving wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the U.S. , as citizens from other countries will be issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come good to the candidates who have the financial funds to support themselves and knowledge that our economy are getting good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to san@@ e track for racing shuttle
over the past few months , over the future of the race course sh@@ utt@@ les have been fought - now it is supposed to go very quickly .
before the end of the year , the route is to be built on which the tourist route is to be built .
in order to safegu@@ ard the future of the programme in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , this year is planned to begin construction work on the route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order the stretch of Il@@ menau race track , the country knows that the country is especially important for tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Under@@ secretary of Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the Friday in Erfurt in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost for the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country will take 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle can also be ordered in the future of the country , will finally be voted to make atonement l .
the Ministry and the southern course of the railway as the operator are already agreed upon by the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the timet@@ able , the vehicles and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
therefore the race gate Shuttle should be ordered from the end of December 2017 .
the race @-@ shuttle is an especially popular rail link between the railway stations of Il@@ menau and the race track .
over the past few months , in the course of a pilot plant has been tested , whether the distance of sufficient many people will be used to order them again in the future .
in addition , the route is very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the ascent of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as they thought it can &apos;t be missed by 2017 , a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for responsible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report about the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , retired professor of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their asc@@ ension serious .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast cancer and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people do so funny , but the company deliver every quantity of it , and we will still get much more common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ und@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with silicon intelligence that can be warm up - with aware of the human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can custom@@ ize his robot also according to its convi@@ ctions , &quot; and so choose everything from the eye color of the robot on the form of breast canc@@ ers until the type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there will be even more troubled , since many robots are the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; to have a step@@ ford @-@ woman pressed out .
modern S@@ und@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone cone .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot makes it possible for example to adapt its users to the properties that make it attractive , such as rel@@ ap@@ ness .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of rel@@ ap@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; says the website of True Compan@@ ion .
that is what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it also has her vote in the course of the day - quite as real people !
it can be tired to be fixed in conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many ad@@ missible aspects of this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the sub@@ mitting femin@@ ine properties , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : resi@@ den@@ ers ) Far@@ rah , is troubled at most .
on his site , true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy , with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a f@@ etic or just just another matter .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement to a little dar@@ ker and deep@@ ens in our culture , on a retreat of the ideal destination of the sexes as an optional adding to sex with dest@@ itution as optional adding .
most men are of course no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , they still remain in the edge of consumer culture .
but what is le@@ ak@@ age from the border zones , can be in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until they are the free market for this purpose .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ ending that these highly developed sex robots in a period , in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a President in the White House , who has helped to have attacked women sexu@@ alised .
the most striking aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the bond@@ woman &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the swallowed body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic these vision acts .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star Pro@@ por@@ es ) .
their inheritance would like to feel hum@@ ility that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point when it goes around their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not constitute real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can not take away from their companion or simply go away .
they do not have a medi@@ ation or background music , nothing that could happen on independence or anything that could distur@@ b the sm@@ ells of total matur@@ ation .

Tr@@ um@@ ps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the concept of healthy human understanding
it is become a binding of the tr@@ ump era , that the political coils , who have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. voters , have also split families in small format .
around the Christmas and harvest of harvest there was in the US newspapers with advice about how to choose k@@ illers by the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump .
we recommend it to all of us to beat our filter bubbles .
the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families have been noted .
I chose this because my cousin , a left @-@ handed di@@ chter@@ in , who lives in Chicago , and has long been dealing with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , this week in New York .
it remin@@ ded me of that unity against a common enemy can have a mighty effect .
at Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can transformation , with which they had fought for decades because of the politics , suddenly and very peculi@@ ar on the same side .
in order to be the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls in another connection , that this is also significant risks with itself .
the left hand was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the im@@ press effect of his presidency has the power to move us all to the right .
if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ assy way for us that his m@@ itt@@ ens should not cast out more out of one day .
however , there is a fri@@ cam@@ est long @-@ time scenario , in the tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alised , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as a concept of distortion .
I find myself today from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ antic version of the dec@@ lining - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least knew we knew how his tax returns ) - both occur as a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be very healthy , to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my cou@@ sine was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of New York park department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city when you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , fi@@ ber@@ glass @-@ designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ y and the animals rotate , in order to watch full fear of their own shoulders - extreme dark and lim@@ per@@ ing music that gives this on a strange manner .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appo@@ inting : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are to be familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not just a dream .
five @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
but the Central Park car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience since two years old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store in this week , my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars , before I could draw my credit card .
in coffee from the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to make an average of 15 % tip - this to buy something about charging .
this leads not only to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also a pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no required is required .
the poor woman in the department store was dis@@ appo@@ inting while I get tired of experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us spent the second time the prison for a hospital visit .
in the past year , he was transferred to the hospital for his hand @-@ bear@@ ers to the hospital , which he suffered his prison conditions according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to death for a first dead belt because of Mor@@ des after an appeal against prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ am amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night int@@ ru@@ der who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that she is very dense .
the national prosecution Authority said that they will be able to raise an obj@@ ection to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim can be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs at risk that his sentence is further increased to 15 years when the attor@@ neys are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ enthal schools , the quad@@ ran@@ chers from F@@ ishing and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dismissed in the holidays and in the next schools .
three of the kidn@@ apping students will go to the gramm@@ ar school , four at the real@@ y school .
school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen an evening .
as a symbol for school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der grows a young eagle that grows in the chicken yard , but then release in freedom .
in addition , the m@@ lower band led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it from his chicken .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope from him a chicken spread , the eagle spread on a high mountain on its wings .
after this , the classes presented three and four at the Y@@ von@@ ne &apos;s studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens dance with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , which bore the cylinders to make the bet .
the Eagle Rise for the integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young is indeed different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but do it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his dest@@ iny is to be free .
they desired each quad@@ t@@ is@@ man that he feels himself in his new school .
it followed thanks to Dan@@ kes@@ ide , the former school manager Michael Müller , who again jumps again with sub@@ str@@ ates , and the parents represented .
the Kü@@ que Age is now over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she leave their pupils after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ cl@@ ä@@ ss@@ ler .
finally , all students leave a song of summer time and holiday homes .
so , with the children , great joy broke out .
eight first @-@ cl@@ ers have already registered for the new school year .
arrested two Bulgarian because of illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians was detained in Greece because of illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from TV , with .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while currently an investigation has been running .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians was released later .
the Greek authorities have the control of the free camps and lay out everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , significant monetary pen@@ alties .

software update for diesel vehicles : what are the suffer@@ ers now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers .
for the diesel @-@ summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the exhaust gas behavior of Euro 5 and partially in Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin by ACE Auto Club Europe is ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action adopted ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates will only apply to vehicles that have been authorised by Schumann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their re@@ arm@@ ament is arranged by the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will clients be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced an exact implementation in the next few months , but still not an exact date .
Daimler has reported to write any data .
when it was due to a inspection , it will be done in their framework .
how long will the change@@ over to go up in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; believes S@@ met@@ anin .
these are from the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturer does not act with the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgra@@ ding itself could take in the workshop only three to four hours .
time elab@@ orate can be a date to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE is for waiting .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would trace , such as met@@ anin .
is there a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just to the regions where the driver still remains .
in the rural room there are no value losses for older diesel .
the ACE is reck@@ oned with a sale yet .
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glorious events in Washington .
the first awards ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - of protest .
ill Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first Rap@@ per one of the prestigious Awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cult device announced on Thursday , this year singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 68 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ izer ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards are given at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will run a reception and participate in the award with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the winners of the Progressive TV series announced that the award winners &quot; Le@@ ar announced therefore to wai@@ ve the participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to negle@@ cted the arts and human rights - and even the means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clari@@ fy its visibility .
according to the former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Centre is the largest cultural device in the US capital .

we make the city li@@ fel@@ ong
Roland W@@ acker , H@@ acker &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes back to R@@ ente in the next year .
however , the job is already written - suitable applicants may be ra@@ r .
he has been W@@ acker City Bu@@ ilder since 31 years .
and the work still makes it great fun , as he gives a press review .
he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , ad@@ mi@@ red him that no application should be filled with the demanding profile .
the city looks for the next time a architect or construction engineer .
so - under cont@@ emp@@ t of regular notice periods - still enough time for a work .
since Has@@ lach joined the administrative community as a Under@@ ground authority , the applicant has to submit relevant connections .
because this function wants to keep the town on any case .
if they were no longer able to fill it , the citizens would have to leave their advice until Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the proximity to the city and himself is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker who reports from a good operating income and good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of more than 30 years , some important projects took place , the h@@ ack@@ ers can look back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing the city of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is more about the building of the building and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even in future are varied projects on the agenda : re@@ arrangement of the former Hu@@ cl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the park car park .
the chin @-@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium premises is still subject .
the latter only would strike around 1.5 million euros in beech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; estimates w@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors .
the work here makes fun . &quot;
design is available for a city center of large toy space .
with h@@ ha@@ y @-@ in @-@ own building yard and gar@@ dener , there could be very flexible in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is known as a ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have a eye on what clean@@ ers , &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ising the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
he has a high responsibility in the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
he is the contractor , &quot; at the end everything runs on my table . &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( portrait ) has been in existence for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep building ) has been in existence for 15 years .
also that his successor remains , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who was really identified with the place . &quot;
for continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operational climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if Roland W@@ acker wants to inherit , after information of the city of Has@@ lach , a graduate study , as a diplom@@ at or Bachelor with specialized device architecture , and have a good knowledge of knowledge in the areas of construction work and building plann@@ er .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ d is underground and deep building planning , building planning , Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ age affairs , administration of urban Li@@ egen@@ schafts@@ betrieb , urban operating system with building yard and city gar@@ dener and Under@@ standing construction authority , including monument protection .
bike on lines are thrown : southern route closed
according to the police , the so far unknown perpet@@ rator had the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the wires .
they were damaged so strong that the her@@ ed@@ itable freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male females and search for the night time after them .
close to the Tat@@ ort , a ro@@ sy robot and a bike rider have been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ ying &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch said to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator would have put themselves in great danger and also at risk of transport .
in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the course and the delay of the delay and the costs for rail transport , even spare parts of the rail could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be paid by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the train traffic on the south route could be led without disabilities .
there were almost ten persons in the morning , two of which were considering correspondence .
freight prints did not fall , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced by around 200 meters of upper lines .
insul@@ ators and masts have also been damaged .
red me@@ ats , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( flamm@@ able per@@ dition disease )
rotate meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , the symptoms of patients could be infl@@ amed .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300,000 , causes stomach cr@@ ats and blo@@ wers , recur@@ ring or bloody crimes , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the suffer@@ ers usually come to avoid their symptoms , researchers found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins , which promote a toler@@ ant int@@ estine .
the executive researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that imm@@ unity in the Dar@@ m pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes to hide themselves in food , do not enter into the body .
cells , who are able to resolve inflamm@@ ation , are balanced by cells that promote the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far transferred to inflamm@@ ation , it may result in anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory per@@ dition .
in experiments , a certain type of tolerance has immune cell in mice that a particular bacter@@ ium in its bow@@ els carry .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins in order to resolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the int@@ estine , and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice of their food , the more they had this immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han toler@@ ant diet toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory mit@@ ig@@ us , if the same system also work with people .
the Post@@ do@@ ctor in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan sought a kind of immune cell that had been found out that a group of study powers had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , which had not yet been accommodated .
they thought that the difference with the gut micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the stomach int@@ estine .
the D@@ är@@ me of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells , but without it lack@@ ed with mice .
mice were made up in a ster@@ ile environment , so that a gut micro@@ bi@@ om was missing and this type of immune cells were not developed , and they were given the Cru@@ ci@@ i and Immun@@ cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria used to grow on the immune system , the researchers welcomed L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then led small quantities of the liquid - without the bacterial cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant conveyor cells .
when the active component is pur@@ ified from the liquid , it proved to be a secondary product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ dairy acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ per were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ da declared that people have the same toler@@ ated transport of cells as mice , and that most of us L. Cru@@ ter@@ i , in our stomach int@@ estine .
it is not known if tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. Cru@@ ter@@ i &apos;s cells are so developing as with mice , but defects in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells are inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the gut .
potentially can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ per values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extensive of these population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believe that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; at Manchester United
in Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; gen@@ ius , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening , his debut against Samp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last @-@ season game before the UEFA Cup race against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impres@@ sing in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho for 45 minutes that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way , how he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ d@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent reveal this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three other new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already performed a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary new duties .
&quot; three of four to get , therefore I thank the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state , but the drawing began but in Marqu@@ ette , Michigan , and moved into the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be the shape of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a car@@ dio for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising already earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new underground for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , the Democratic Republic of Ministers went up with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no interference from the party centre , except no counter@@ wind from the Federation - so was the most important wish of the election .
since Martin Schulz has changed the party , the fundament@@ ally has changed .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus can be observed with increasing the events in the SPD @-@ governing state capitals .
as Schulz from there since the beginning of the year , Schulz would not have been described by the opposite wind .
it was low supplements .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal Council of Lower Saxony sees a general signal against Ko@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ Green can &apos;t shed light , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fragments of a Green Party did the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the ab@@ ounding Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ons to return to its mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the voters .
El@@ ke T@@ o@@ west must immediately return its mandate , &quot; the Federal Executive Guide and elec@@ toral campaign of the Green Party national network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ ed a SPD election campaign , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ an@@ ship reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stood after the survivors of the Green MPs El@@ ke T@@ avi@@ d to the CD@@ U without his own government majority .
it is the temporary cul@@ mination of a whole rows of large and small crises in SPD provincial walls .
and no one knows what is next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , calm down the com@@ rades .
after the state elections of Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and indeed it was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the deaf , the Düsseldorf @-@ bank@@ rupt@@ cy left the party .
the com@@ rades re@@ iter@@ ated the com@@ rades in the weeks afterwards again .
then , when they had just pped new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next deep sleep .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD s@@ lei@@ gh@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he made all wrong in crisis communication , everything that can be wrong .
since then Schol@@ z figh@@ ts to his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust emissions and its role in the Supervisory Board , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has already been in criticism of the criti@@ que .
mi@@ ese conversion values came added .
nonetheless , or perhaps just why , because of the past few weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ ents in the state of acc@@ ents .
the endeav@@ or of the former Mayor of Hannover , to expand his power in Berlin , remained not hidden in the field of Martin Schulz .
they let him , because they promised by a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite might enter .
in doing so , Weil is no fault at the party , the Lower Sax@@ on Green is basically no fault .
and he didn &apos;t know .
the com@@ rades make an effort to make their own rows closed .
her anger is set up in the Gre@@ ens , and here is mainly on the bott@@ om@@ ni@@ ge parliam@@ ents in T@@ avi@@ aries .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ cking , such as wife li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets have their own career over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of par@@ tak@@ ers in the SPD federal government , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets has not been elected as a director of directors , but on the regional list of the Lower Sax@@ on Green Party as the Lower Sax@@ on Society .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD federal government , compla@@ ins a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vote tw@@ ist four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have formed Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads down the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate for the general election of R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U dep@@ ra@@ cted the elec@@ toral result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said further . &quot;
he called to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there have been more or more additional support of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding funds for Ort@@ is@@ ers III
who would like to san@@ e to the years of commented house , can get the next support from the country .
about this inform@@ al mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g City development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen / Germany .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again a review to the so @-@ called skill .
since 1991 , it has been added to the rehabilitation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg have taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is important to promote the interior development , and not only new building areas .
on April 4 , I have received the information from the Government of Government Karlsruhe that there will be a san@@ itation zone III .
the funding amount amounted to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the village Emp@@ fingen .
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
you will continue to investigate so sk@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area at all interest , to san@@ e .
if necessary , the territorial limits could then be moved again .
the jet@@ ty came on Wednesday evening , Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal state @-@ program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the san@@ itation would then be carried out .
core of the program are the Rev@@ en@@ alization of inner cities , improving the residential and working conditions and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be objects , which is carried out by the plot .
finally the rehabilitation area would finally be established as an ordinance .
the approval period for the funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , however , the current consumption would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionn@@ aire .
as of November or December , the proposition should take place as possible , so that the coming year can be started with the San@@ pl@@ ings .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann said that each commune must carry out pre @-@ investigation research .
it is therefore why to evaluate the urban abuse and decide when it is renovated and in what extent is .
it will then be entered into the respective property for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after Emp@@ fingen , and make a picture of the situation , promised it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , an essential success rate for the project is the participation of the involved parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore it will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and land arch &quot; where it goes among other things around the building situation and the restoration prospects .
in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and residential districts , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a living space .
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; can be filled only when the premises are operated in the building .
however , in mind that Got@@ zel pointed out that a con@@ cre@@ ant questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler empha@@ sized that the distribution of funding is working according to the &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ und Prin@@ ciple , &quot; who first comes first , grin@@ d first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there could be no funding funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the project &quot; Ort@@ is@@ ers II &quot; project was shown in order to make a re@@ development of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ ner II &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a navy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event which exp@@ ires American manufacturing within the last month , will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military which received the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 2@@ 4.000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D known as Marine One , when the President on board was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and Head of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the helicopter was issued in Connecticut with a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the White House designed the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the Hel@@ icop@@ ter Hel@@ icop@@ ter Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of this , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event , the deputy commander to the representative of the representative .
the news showed that the helicopter hit the South La@@ wn in the morning at 7 p.m. on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds , if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for return flight .
during the event , the original airline crew was in the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel remained on the ground during the time .
the records provided by the TI@@ ME were not clear whether the second aircraft was ultimately necessary .
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal property to use state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question that we asked if it was a violation of the Hatch Acts , and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
the &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and were not covered by Brands Act .
but the official events are political ones .
on the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ itated the efforts to implement the government regulations .
the use of the plane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
Pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo procedure is unusual .
tr@@ ump created a study in February , when the presidential air@@ liner service in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services provided , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the Presi@@ dential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is impressed by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Head of the White House , Lind@@ sey Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to reduce the US President in the White House with precise positions .
at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led to the White House for 58 exercises .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official .
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours in this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers took the load for none of the other acquisitions , which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in remembrance the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it &apos;s difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the U.S. Department of Ministry for the financial year 2017 , the Do@@ D processing rate for the v@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
notes of the unit recorded the flight time of the airplane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House argue that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter block far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax pay@@ ers based on the basis of estim@@ ation approaches , is very dec@@ ep@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are contained in the annual funds . &quot;
according to a survey conducted from 2015 , the licence sets for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs but also take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former pressing of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have been un@@ ti@@ ring .
it is of course reasonable to highlight . &quot;
it was not clear if tr@@ ump was inter@@ ag@@ itated by helicopter , when he became a tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House Tr@@ ump said to Represent@@ atives of Si@@ kor@@ sky , with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation .

&quot; it &apos;s not difficult for us .
you can also need a good portion of happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the Trip in the high north stands practically .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump wasn &apos;t really happy when he put on Wednesday evening his signature under the law for deep@@ ening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his cur@@ ator , the Act to adopt , &quot; I entered the Congress a few &quot; constitutional regulations &quot; in it .

since then , investors have been settled in local O@@ MV in cooperation with other European companies and co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern New Zealand North Stream 2 .

nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences so the official statement of the oil concert .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order .
twelve weapons stand there for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press has seen what the group could turn off , and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

roll back : the city represents 46 colours
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch itself .
with fixed contacts for the children and an order for the team .
the watch is turned back in the urban day@@ care centres .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the essence of food in the urban kinder@@ garten ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , Deputy Head of the Department of Jugend@@ buch , this is a good news : &quot; we all have very pleased . &quot;
cooked to the house there is still except house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
the city runs in the Kre@@ fields area 46 children &apos;s centres , in 44 the children get a lunch time a warm meal .
last year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not only eating children who are taken care of 45 lessons , at the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pom@@ er@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision when children remain until 14 am . &quot;
46 participants have a service of 46 participants from 1 September 2015 : they have warm meals , supplement of salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tional the meal , give food , cleaning , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ance .
the size - there are two @-@ group@@ ed as well as sevent@@ e@@ ographic institutions - decides about the hour@@ ly circumference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now fixed to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are much stronger , and it is easier for the communication line easier , educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example it goes : healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff may be sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in K@@ ita , a person who tru@@ sts to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for the children .
the su@@ re@@ ation of the K@@ ita rooms - so far as the work of the kitchen forces - will be done in future with special cleaning service .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen capacity , it also has the charm of charm and foreign award for the city as the most economic activity , it says from the Press Office .
and that , although 46 participation forces will be re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for about 750 people in the gu@@ ardian area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB @-@ Occup@@ ation about investments in the Mc@@ Show@@ ie Factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a union with managers of the Bis@@ c@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ us@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , along with other products plan@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; would be experienced as first , if their activities would change .
in a letter to the branch office of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; concerns concerns the financing of production lines should not be powered . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can no clarity of the general needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ us@@ cross , it concerns our members .
generations of families have been working here and the labour force are strongly concentr@@ ating on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important column for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social discrimination .
hence , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosper@@ ity , and before the background of Bre@@ x@@ ite , the rising life cost and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a flor@@ ins of production at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch office at T@@ oll@@ cross was only received yesterday a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react to it , as we estimate the continuous engagement in employees and trade union representatives .

we discussed with the employees that we are working like all companies that are working in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , our shops are able to check and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operating improvements .

has warned the PS@@ G Barcelona three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League likes her interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar after leaving an offer of £ 189 million in order to resolve its fre@@ ew@@ ays , but they have warned about three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach is heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the former brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way , like N@@ ey@@ mar en@@ forced his way to the outside of the Catal@@ ans , although the club has always been given its best to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 to care of him .
but the football world was warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G @-@ President before this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign up one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not wor@@ ried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , and we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign up one of our players , they will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona also seems to have exceeded this line , the Spanish association beginning this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti express .
PS@@ G did clearly that they would not allow it to travel from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by increasing their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

it would be very serve the appearance of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have deep@@ ening their own om@@ is@@ sions on their own om@@ is@@ sions or their time false assessment of the processes .
on the other hand , the Vatican City of Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , however , critic@@ ised that the coverage of violence with &quot; two measures &quot; must be measured in the reporting .
in regards to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doub@@ ted that it would be punished and prevented in the future , but the author Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , histor@@ ian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics committee .
&quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
the princip@@ alities also in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go on to the church and that &apos;s a fine Fres@@ sen . &quot;
Moreover , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; beats a quite normal pe@@ dagog@@ ical resources , &quot; to be finished with fre@@ eing children , as I was one to be finished . &quot;
they fires it un@@ fair , present standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often di@@ pped .
totally wrong , the author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was translated with R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; My Brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which is presented by the b@@ ish@@ op@@ ric of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of the lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 reg@@ im@@ ents were sexually ab@@ used with high Pl@@ au@@ si@@ vity &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ uses .
in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can hold on that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of forms of physical and mental violence .
even in high emot@@ ion , the punishment for the pupils could be more severe .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other regulatory evidence , that many victims had been rated by R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview H@@ emann , why the final report to the abuse of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger declares his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents from the &quot; pre@@ judi@@ cat@@ ors &quot; in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contra@@ dict@@ ory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a lifting many students &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as cholesterol and Perf@@ ection , who was able to handle the ö@@ f@@ teren when a domain kit produced musi@@ cally no top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if one reads the trouble and the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask for why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
he is devoted to him just eight pages and it is clearly acquitted of every suspic@@ ion of the medi@@ a@@ fore or mit@@ ig@@ ship in the terrible cases of sexual abuse are acquitted .
the violence of violence in the school took place outside of its impact sphere .
you can &apos;t want to mention it , of which too late or have taken first clari@@ fications seriously .
the Dom@@ inion gramm@@ ar gramm@@ ar gramm@@ ar , which he was active , was told by practically all those questioned - &quot; redemption , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ined about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emot@@ ion , which led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ brü@@ chen .
that he has not only cast out with chairs and cast the key captives on the ground , but also ear@@ ne@@ cks distributed guys to hair or ears he has already been given back for years , deeply regre@@ t and to exc@@ use them .
however , to his honorary doctor , however , must have been said that such correc@@ tions were widespread in the fra@@ y period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents , such as teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us was born 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state gramm@@ ar school .
compared to what about it is in this report , namely , the alleged sexual abuse and the non@@ violence in the school , the release of Bag@@ at@@ ellen are .
there is no one to say whether it &apos;s not rather with its popularity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI to do that many media had just fell on him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood it , still e@@ ager .
but the truth is : the report of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s report in every respect !
in connection with the report it was reported very much about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also put on a load on sexual abuse in terms of sexual abuse in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite no no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have committed the domain master .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never looked about to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims were silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rator .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Stud@@ ents R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a frag@@ mented student formulated like this : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no event , in which it was possible ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) , and could have had the respective perpet@@ rator .
I remember it ... also for really absur@@ d to accept that ... Bu@@ ben in@@ sist@@ ence or cle@@ arer or more often opened , as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ors , confi@@ denti@@ stry , confi@@ denti@@ stry , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
in this way , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that the subject of affected students and / or their environment was not confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
so what is sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is to release from every fellow workers .
thus , it cannot be charged , nor prevented him or have brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradi@@ cted crimes in connection , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of having been accused of having &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Weg@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he have to live with this design ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the great problem that in the reporting , it has been mixed and mixed up to a giant mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be clean separately : between the school and gramm@@ ar school children , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as we say once , other pre@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , the report dates from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had not been chor@@ us of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible testing of pe@@ dagog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ west teachers were ir@@ rig@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ited , all of them were defeated at the school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ in@@ ous states have to have ruled .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he did not get the boys only when they were already at the Dom@@ inion gramm@@ ar school .
on this one was , as most of the most witnesses , the theme &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
it was only happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what else was at the domain rate gramm@@ ar ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ urban@@ ces .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims had the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot;
thus , at the most still the throw , ch@@ ained .
however , in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just began to establish itself and from their predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) would not hear , and then again in 1993 .
do Georg R@@ atz@@ inger flow@@ ed in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ inion gramm@@ ar school , which the report even reproduced .
he pointed out this to them , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test sentence will continue to be pract@@ ised . &quot;
already in view of the risk of negative press structures , it is recommended .
it was of course that , at a time as a legal clarity , was also banned as an aud@@ itor in Bavaria .
prior to that , they occurred in a legal gray zone , as everyone knows of us .
there was also difficult to estimate him , where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic , where really the permitted limit had been exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say too , he could always be taken away .
it simply is not true .
only in 1980 , the German testing of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .
princip@@ alities in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis maintained it was un@@ fair , that today &apos;s pe@@ dagog@@ ical standards apply to that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak histor@@ ians since the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger to evaluate to today &apos;s moral standards .
and the princip@@ alities already has been right .
but this is not true of course , of course , not for sexual abuse , which was absent for all times and was also broken down to innocent children of innocent children , that goes far beyond that of the time .
that &apos;s all quite dre@@ ad@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally finished .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to the discipl@@ ines and punishment , so ear to draw and ears to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when the physical punishment had been banned , he also has kept it on it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what image of its Reg@@ ens@@ burger period has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussions with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing also to speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : now , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedict XVI &apos;s life , tells of his perspective , since the domains played just a side role .
nevertheless , I didn &apos;t forget that he led a reg@@ iment there .
but this also has to be said : without these perfect discipline , it would probably hardly ever been possible to form a institution of world tran@@ g , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make any major singers and before each success , just in which area , but discipline , passion and self @-@ win@@ dow@@ ment .
as for a person , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really good and always experienced as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep faithful and heart@@ ily people , from which you can &apos;t imagine that it could be a little bit too much .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still get in contact with him today , 23 years after his Emer@@ gency , regularly contact him , attend to him - he is almost blind - and him treat him as a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him up to this day , so that he was strictly strictly to them , so they are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are now than@@ k@@ ful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always was a good , v@@ ital@@ ian teacher - a controversial father , certain that may be , but also a loving Res@@ p@@ ect@@ os@@ son , to which they still have seen , and honour them .
and please , once again clearly stated : everything one has th@@ rows him , correc@@ tive methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because it is promin@@ ently and has a major brother to make a medi@@ al fall .
there is the wicked intention that stands behind it , only too obvious .
because the report , which was just released , was dischar@@ ged him .
now , the lawyer would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had gained great achievements and without leaving out the outside of Bavaria and probably in Germany would probably be able to get the reg@@ ression of the cathedral in peace .
