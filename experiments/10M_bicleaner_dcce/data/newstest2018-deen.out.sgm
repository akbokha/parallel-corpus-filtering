<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where youth meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A salftchapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners have the same reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's nervous if landing cards are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows each one that had to be exciting because the Navi Auto Navi takes place in a green grass.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal of Bavaria in the State Government, are all other than current - but therefore very easy to play.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compares them with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a tiltable carpet, which one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The large crossing card has been incorporated into the cities and municipalities of detailed maps, so-called urine sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">This originated according to the Bayerisches Measurement Administration council between 1810 and 1864, and jump the first survey of Bayatric.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Customer: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the spring of 1800 the French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops finally went away with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, today's neighbours, who created the idea of an extensive Bavaria-card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian government management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original location for Munich dates from 1856, and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian National Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / Today is the most impressive example of the state of the state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded in all directions and has grown.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 1877, on the establishment of the map, in 1877, was designated as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Ssendling is located right in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower Austria are concentrating around 1856 alongside today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmer against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the western park is, you can see nothing at the first glance: when zoom out a smaller part with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten flat pieces from the so-called "Urabsorption" which was derived from the property tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Little plots there, today there are no farmers, but small gardeners of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810, in the October 19th century, was in fact a meadow and a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar there's the historical map an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urquonsleaf, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, not only the street names "in the track" or from the height "on the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfield street, people were once locked to people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There, in 1858 / 59 the Munich county-Irrenanstalt "was created.</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden accompanied the establishment of a psychiatrist who is brought to death by King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the purchase of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he denied the staff to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition at the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had been first place, later it was added to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirre complex in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatatrics in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people now meet at the premises of the former Auer Anstalt in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth shelter with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco," established by bombing of the Irene anstalt, was destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed as "Head of Place," the shopping street was called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change in the Second World War also brought in the heart of Münker.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke out in December 1944 many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienyard.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a greeting from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienyard, where these days work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking will take place for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider of the old Munich map, the old Munich map will compare with the aerial view today - and fill the hole at the Marienyard.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group released Travel Guide for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Federation for the Promotion of Colour has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri by the discriminating policy and racial attacks of the state after Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for regular attention due to the state, since a set of fragmentalists to present themselves in the entire state and noted here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved law of Missouri, which makes people difficult to complain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, caused the group to publish the travel agency, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have the injuries of the civil rights, who happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are put together because of their skin colour, they are put together or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear Complaints in such a frequency which we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group of incidents such as ravisors against black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "Sanders died in the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state, and by the police of Missouri by the police, without having charged a crime." ""</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report published by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri, in which there will be 75 percent more common than white in the state.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be ready to bring it, whether they bring chewing money or their relatives, they are going to travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 Hassim in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassverbrek report of the FBI, which flows the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of employment or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American National Liberties Union (ACLU) issued budwarnings for Texas and Arizona, having committed local prosecution authorities to shed people due to hikes, which will contribute to the ACLU's further reinprofiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Traveling companions are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in the last time advocacy groups have the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">WeidecaunProject is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherbacher Weidecaun-Project is a successful project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag sealed Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture in front of the site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right excavator of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fisherbacher CDU-town centre met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his operation in which he maintained 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and houses five apartments of holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" black "" "" black milk "" "" is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann. "" "</seg>
<seg id="73">There is only regional guests at the table of the holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also called BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he called the WeidecaunProject as "Elementar important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not lead to such a steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much must be processed with the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and top photography," Schwendemann emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elonial operation and cultivate this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he do not lead a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the community has recognized the meaning of the wheat project and is happy to promote the leader of the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the list of areas could still be gone out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and thought about how they continue their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often standing in criticism of criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 parcels of eleven people were enclosed in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conservation area is 40 hectares, which may not be forged for at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of them was promoted over leader, a quarter the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers stay for 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of Weidecaun.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you make a really good job, without farmers and landing."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White, the best food being produced here. "</seg>
<seg id="91">The state of Landscape (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg enables state funding of Weideferns.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR conveyalties.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the unicirated area may not be tracted (handictionist over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the claims.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherbacher wheat project 2018, the application is currently being able to build eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, which are calculated at more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House takes up the Statue of Liberty in front of the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safety signs of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate these equally like any other - hence the overthrow Saddam Hussein's place in Baghdad in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic number with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the president to dragging the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat beseepers and Liberty Imitators would have looked at him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked her meaning, and especially the importance that her was attributed to the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta impanzee: "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom which enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to which you have been added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively right, but as he formulated himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the raged words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your labour, and your afflicted masses, which yearns to breathe free to breathe in, to the afflicted waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elabortion" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">He did not engage in literary criticism - he made clearly that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who were forced to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they had a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Republicism, in an unused classic image depicting the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the object with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change the right wing of the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The large Schreihas Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not allowed to bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely and even a question of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative fact of Lazarus was in it, to see how it exhausted from the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travels on the ships of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people that seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not to recognize the perspective, the Miller and trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not shine on the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black, Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time when two skies were owned by the Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">The power director of the Field Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the World Championships "team will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"" "Black believes that" "" "in Scotland has developed something special" "" "and the Athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it." ""</seg>

<seg id="134">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type of road corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of the circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals, among whom Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team for the team mates.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their surrender address was amazing, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and real feeling that Eilidh took all of course, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m Hurdles, says that it is "incredible," that 16 shallots in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championships were seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-stretch of Muir leads on this path and has been positioned five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part of the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of races.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another chotte, which one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other scotte was in team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Manna capitalist states that it is very proud of the fact that many of their countrymen do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finishers.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "this is so special, that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chosen me, making it something very special for me," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"I obviously am very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to Podes.</seg>
<seg id="155">What do my speech concern as chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it was good.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, since we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It's really important to sit on this home support and to benefit from that we are back in the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete again and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block by critics on Facebook: do not work for a public service if you do not tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him for all, from the internal policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He chimply imply for the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for the year 1783, Washington said:" "" "the Redefness can be taken away - and, silly and dumb, we will be like the sheep for battles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland Larry Hogan who needs to work on it, to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people, and erased their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American National Liberties Union shortened him about the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor of the Governors dismissed the lawsuit as a frivole, and the online comment was full of counteracting effect with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when there is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest vote of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary thermal head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use facebook as pricelestres to join himself with its voters and to perform his haunless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockade of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is officially referred to and of employees who will be paid with public tax-dollars - unnecessary, and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the governors and argued that the blockade of the comments was nothing further than a presentation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of castors or spammers or hash filled people that vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, no roller.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told that their comments were respectful, and not profited.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarani of Bolike, Md., was not hash full, but she asked to Hassade.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented on that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hassure and other current news," she wrote in the commentary range of the message "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't think this idea, if a number of people takes place on the same topic, then they will be used by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the governor as" concentrated spam attack "" "" would call others "" "" intercession "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply block a critics, or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It's much cleaner than in former times, when one had done the same thing, employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical leaders and bring to silence or demonstrators to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happened.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who criticises his Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users, blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, last the First Amendment, according to the US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when they banned a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit to ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers in multifaceted between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous pamphers struck a lead.</seg>

<seg id="451">"we do not believe in a regulation of jurisdiction, and we take care seriously.</seg>
<seg id="452">We also take the law and authority that gives us serious. "</seg>
<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA suggested that Pruby sometimes will use its "awareness to the delay and all other legally independent, to ensure that the regulations" are based on a solid policy and the best available information. "</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July at 16.30.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and nice view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius plant, a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">Rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and supporters of tumours at their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini highlights: "it is a unique village of villages."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, St. Hilariuselle has been mentioned for the first time in the Württembürgbook, Count Hermann of Sulz, and the Vogtei "to Magi Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The word according to the document was based on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the embarking parish church, also a local court that belonged to the church or the patron saint, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So, people also lived there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the city's headquarters of 1858, next to the village and the Oberdorf, which today in the area of tumours are still visible, the "Berg" of the third, the manorial municipal core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old cards from the time around 1600 substrates these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronite was formed from the early medieval Oenkirchena law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A Lord that built a church was built, and took part in a priest, and remained the owner of this church, and could also inherit the suitability of this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus, the right to use a pastor or bishop create a new pastor.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars were in the church, and two bells in the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greatest of the two craters in Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell tower was first recorded in 1692 but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648) the shutters were pushed and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to overthrow in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from the dead.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarii church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was settled.</seg>
<seg id="490">In 1834, a storm split the bell tower and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only one of the 750 years old church history remained only today.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallenberg and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the "Schaffhausen" as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius system.</seg>

<seg id="501">The Serenade is only taking place at dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters at the preservation of the historical St. Hilarius system, which is of importance for tumours and listening.</seg>

<seg id="572">A 1948 Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and shrunk to the Ford Bridge of Moore.</seg>
<seg id="573">Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, the bridge could reach the bridge, a group of white men came with rifles to block his way.</seg>
<seg id="574">The leader of the Mobs - a man middle age in a needle strike - took a long train on his cigar, looking through the windshield.</seg>

<seg id="586">It serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice was never corrected.</seg>
<seg id="587">"we want to be prosecuted, we want to end, we want healing, we want to make atonement, but first we must receive justice," he said.</seg>

<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.</seg>

<seg id="639">A couple is from Ithaca, New York, traveled to see the performance, many come down the road.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of the story is nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-year-Grunge "(as the pioneer of MTV turnaround), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefacts, it is equally a parody and a caching of our Facebook-capable era permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise feels it feels less than that time.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"First Day of Camp," surprisingly good, not just because of its absurd Humors (it contained a original history for speaking of vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By moving forward to the core of the grid - actor average age play small children, which will grow up - they still create the impossibility of winning the last part of the Witzes back.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"Ten Years Later", with its adults who now play adults is less emotional and his parody goes beyond the Stalker movies of the 90-' s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" (The Hand, who spelt the cradle ").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At a point hbert found a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>

<seg id="1196">It makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who feels its former big Man-on Camp Andy and feels like a old backer.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments of accidental madness which could heat this Franchise like a sort of repetitive conclusion: "Wet Hot Summer Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band, how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgic: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even at "Glow" with his east-east ring Iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy inspired by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created comedy inspired by Brian Gatewood: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, that fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main rollers - a hard singer Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues from Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt become synchronized in English.</seg>

<seg id="1204">And the list of the famous spokesman - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'finde' voice '.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is committed to the truthfulness of a despairing propaganda-drama - a murderer that carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays as a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">During six long episodes there is gone, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which has been recompiled to a lower length, as Gregor and Iosef has always been coming back to the American Embassy, whose lobby are always occupied by two thick men, who will swallow up a heap of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media prestence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a reduced course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps white house, which he would like to repair, bad information, that come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information should get around him - whether on paper or in stamp - because the president would get better decisions if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnostic makes sense but others are trying to count Trump, to monitor his media activity.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship for television dates back to decades - and now, where he is in the White House, its TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if a candidate was offended because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politico Tara Palmeri wrote a time that "the key to hold Trumps Twitter is under control, according to six former electoral campaign officials, to ensure that its personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter is ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaigns were something that we do not know others - that trumps Tweets have not yet contain any more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We probably never know about the Tweets, the trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff were able to create it some times, annoyance of him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has to prevent it consistently, that trump controversy is calling.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people together in a White House which puts together out of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by making trump material, that may bring their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politics - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to provide more information on the President of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump civil servants say that Trump can react to negative press releases, especially those with damaged, and that it arises out of how these originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This happened at the end of February, when someone made a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet-Provokateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Head Office of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap to be from Lecks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Even though Johnson banned healing permanently from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or expressed in the past, or revoke it in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to inquire at the staff of Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldsmith added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," attempted to implement a system to manage and document the trump. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that open?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove itself as a more effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his pulse self, and his counselors still strive to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">This unchangeable factors make a ways mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affaires: US Special Enemler sets a Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair by US President Donald Trump, a special fund Robert Mueller is supposed to have used a so-called Grand jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The "Wall Street Journal" wrote the work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" "" "on appeal to the same thing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper mentioned the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensify its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">CNN broadcaster reported that there have already been the first advance of the Gremixes in connection with a meeting between Trumps Elderly son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accused the Kremlin since long, targeted targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were differences between trumps electoral team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are supposed to be held in the election campaign as advisor of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller received more and more drumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post, "wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonderkommando was personally taken into the center and ingesture, whether the President in the course of the affair had possibly disguised the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine and decide whether the evidence is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jurys are therefore also called counts of the Prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they will be switched on if they are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always closed behind the closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The board can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to download people under the oath by people.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, CNN have already been issued to spin around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement, named it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">Moreover, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. were also Trumps Consultant and mother-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his father's election campaign Paul Manafort with the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-right words on Thursday evening in the US television that the translation shows that Mueller should not leave in his work, and that he should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not be forced that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the objection of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia, in order to present Russia's affair as a campaign to his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme give the democrats a possibility to feel "well, because they have nothing else to talk about that they can speak."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb declared in a statement that was ignorant of a Grand jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this is normally working in secret agents, but he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any measures that accelerated the work of the special fund on "faire" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey said three times, that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to assume that something has changed in it, he called it in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had been fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this routing, the accusation against trump had become noisy, he wanted to handicate justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a SenatsCommittee, Trump has asked him to ask for an investigation of the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under large print due to the examination.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to the U.S. media, the White House gathered the White House material against the specials and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That solved speculation about whether Trump Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special executives of the Congress such as in the Watergate affair the President Richard Nixon, Mueller has fired a position in which he could be fired in theoretically at the president of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several transformers of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators were submitted to the legislature on Thursday, after which the special fund could not be dismissed so easy.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The more than a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres are now driven out to the north and become probably two or three years until he was melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is available with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest iron ore which researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people is not of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">In how far the climate change has played a role in the crash of ice, it is unclear to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, there have been a series of unusual condues in the region since around 30 years in the region, writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a Fakuma.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In opinion of many researchers, this could be combined with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Now the broken coloss has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floating on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is growing always further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfei was the equilibrium of wax and break off some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete feather is to be broken down there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are some evidence that Larsen-C-Schelfeis is at risk, because the front edge has never pulled so far as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate runs under tension and can be broken down, if one piece of a piece of key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases sea level as sea level, since they swim in water so much water as it arises after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the feeder indicate that glaciers can reach the sea directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a small size, the British research project writes to the Antarctic research project (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to the AWI-C, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest archipelago in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">The distance from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks periodically.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" even though it is natural, and we don't have any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign comes into a dangerous position, "" "" Martin O'Leary "" "" said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most far retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Under scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis re-rise again or fall again in the long term, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added, "" "" our models say that it will be less stable. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researcher did not bring this gigantic iceberg to climate change, so in the past decades, there are very many skelves of the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long Zip of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data of the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase has contributed.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He became a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the destructive conditions and due to the diseases transferred to insects, which scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions to find solutions, big headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert for agricultural research institutes CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant had been exposed to impacts of climate change in the past years, and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has impact on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits the Zwergzides, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only for vacationists, it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">For the solutions that are considered, a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground, but also the spray of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties which are resistant to dry-resistant.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of an journalists underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce will usually meet on Wednesdays in order to check its plans for the latest chaos in the State of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and undisturbed drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Discuss two high-ranking journalists, what a safer place: they should take their children with the office that were in 2009 the goal of a attack with grenades, or let them be at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security professionals have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutrality, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter to propose names for every column - no evidence is necessary to make use and abdominal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug muggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand in the base of the government or the cartel, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest break from violence, and during all the land the corpses, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto died in December 2012. 589 stand after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter you can be editors and their Inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence becomes low, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, pointing at the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporter in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporter discuss their shared topics, the trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although in 2010, a special General Assembly was erected in order to process the cases of journalists, it was initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the committee for the protection of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with thousands of murders, who are associated with drug trafficking and organisational crimes every year, the murderers are only rarely asked in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still consist of treatment to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are still in the east and even though the terrain is now slanternal.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without righteousness, the meeting on the discussion of security is little benefits, Ibarra says.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid, my time in this workshop" "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we know not the Why, we miss everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He was able to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla on two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot at him for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it close.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the theme of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">If Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition into the United States in January had become one of the bloodiest battlements of the country since rivalisation factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people can be shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of injured, two-story mouse on drugs that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget it for a minute that there is a state of the "tranquility" if only a cartel control of coastal towns with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the fault that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February, in February the publication of a interview with the Damasception of a Damascary map fractions held in war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may offend the sons suspected, that power members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez not to force after the seizure of a different newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived, that his friends and colleagues did not feel that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he was joined with five colleagues to the founding of Riodoce, and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without encounter the noise of poison," said Bojoram.</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time the newspaper had served a reputation because of the courageous and honourable coverage, and the turnover and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it, hard treats without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories, which no one ventured for anything else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for its coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists in the persecution of Mexican drug history, where she always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily surrendered to him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ-Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in the past October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take over the task that falls as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I would not want to be asked:" "" "what have you done so much dead? why did you not tell what happened before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">Valdez, the Riyce team, Valdez, who could curse the fun, who was like a harbour worker, who was generously with Umarines and advice, a teacher who knew how one survived.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit down there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to ask their own approach to question as they can do their work in the best and remain in the life.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home start and landing ways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojoram.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-sur and self catering.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinctive.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it smells wrong, keep away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is said the Editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "scent is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say in Sinaloa no more, as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smells, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape has constantly changed.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly there were suddenly no mobile phones. days earlier, Spyware that is exclusively sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">In the shade, two policemen sought refuge from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were asked by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in Purim, some of the reporter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, which the governor had committed itself as non-trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporter went into the mountain landscape, where the drug bound is under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has left on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending, concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group of which led in Culiacan's most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when everyone knows that everyone in the city know: that the restaurant is a favorite restaurant of drugs and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the rule of a political party (Pri), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several Pri governors were charged because of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, among them one in which a son of "El Chapo" was one of a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, the readers had considered the columne of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "previous" "" "we had already knew what happened," "" said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" "" "because of its slim body handle." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communicating with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers who protested against the murders of journalists because the staff has never expected something else: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Miriam Ramirez was a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor's Office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and civil servants say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In all the country, journalists were stronger, by being organised in organized protagonists "SOS Press" on salaries and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the Valdez's Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to send journalists and bring them to the truth, because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that the government is divided again, because it worried about that her rage has violated its object.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had been repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes, involved in the government officials and a uniform corporation. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporter will not only be put on drugs, but also on orders of politician and security forces that are using the organised crime under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group "Articulo 19 has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists and officials in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you know because they want to hold the mouth," Ramirez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the morde have a horrific effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forget the death of the bloginist Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that supposedly signed by the Zau cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">One computer keyboard and headphones are next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Norte in northern border of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondents Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo for the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez set up publicly on the drug card with a leading article on the title page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home states, or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the roads and look for hazards.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they chased out, according to the photographer Reuben Espinosa who was in 2015, together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>

<seg id="1913">A number of shooting paintings with band EQ and security forces near the Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met on something that seemed to the surrounding rocks on the square, and decided to see more precise.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this plant-eater, although it is covered with armament, and resembles a converting tank, probably threatened by meat-eaters dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide themselves off predators, and used a paratroopic technology that is used as a counter-proof, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix up in its surroundings and to soften its enemies, experts say that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family has first made headlines in May and is now seeing the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have studied the wild animal, and there were Borealopelta markmitchelli, after the museum steamer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armrests on its body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the Conterns, a widespread defense method in animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the console is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far the animals live today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was chased out of sufficient pressure by the dinosaurs Dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation was beneficient as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the Conterns - think of Rehe, Zebras or belts - are much smaller and hurt as a prey, which indicates that this camaurier was exposed to a real struggle.</seg>

<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs when he died, was moved into a river and went out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was so warm as a southern side today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much beyond than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge thermal periods, carnivores dinosaur, who stood on two legs, the earth passed through.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was chased out of some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest insights in the journal current Biology appear to believe that Borealopelta was removed after the death in the sea and was mapped in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn funk, on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, green.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the most preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips on his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the pancreted plant was flooded through the western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater feeding of the dinosaur kept his armour in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin will still cover holurge plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, this is such a level of preserving as much as a profit in lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more it becomes.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How one activist came to study the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after they arrived in New York City, the camp sitting in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of a Airbnb apartment, rented it and scroll by Facebook on their phone.</seg>

<seg id="2024">Confused, since no one had posted information on her feed, she completed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly worshiped on their Timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old man who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leper body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was for them and her fellowship is nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="2030">It embarked on her mobile phone later, in order to return to Tweets on people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be a sign with inscription: "Fergusons Police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed in which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a bellate dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said that a different policy is his rifle and cried, saying, "I will kill you all... animals all kill you."</seg>

<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt blamous.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she brought her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protesting, the strength and strength, the strength and resistance of resistance, which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who bore a caulifter and a matching crown, brought to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times in the morning "on the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "just as I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "they remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and halted them to pass demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah's Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her camera of Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to merely document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came Ferrell in the sense: "want to document, or tries to find a story that you can get out?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepsis was nourished by countless cases of people, often from white - in a community that benefited from her pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan said recently in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their votes were not centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for its activism around Todestrakt-occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer, along with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets followed?" in the years after Browns vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us." "" "said Davis." ""</seg>

<seg id="2067">The aim was to focus on ferrells experience - to show that it is not a Messiah guide, but for a community which comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most revealing participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells live, as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain level of injuries in this work and the human digitization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells has repeatedly repeated the role of the black flawls in the wider Black-Lives-Matter Movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which according to the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>

<seg id="2074">Black, swinged women must bear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">The folayan voted to notice that "the movement is really kept by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it consists of that" "" "this is not a groundbreaking type of action," "" "when the herell was chosen as the heart of the film" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the message cameras have long since disappeared in Ferguson, but the rassal connections between the community and the police continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on currency for 2 ½ years due to the blockade of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social policy of the area that they call her home: "a chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2089">The Bit Galerie moves the people, although they are not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian area has been split up since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the topic hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg," the theme is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery say: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "that would be real-class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no human being" (Siggi Boccupy) or quite simple: "Orwahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the tempter states that there will be a gallery more customers to the city, of which also the other shops will benefit, the enemy will fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is located exactly on the property, on which the farms market stands, in which 13 Directors will offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction works will be completed with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we've been selling nearly weekly in the farms market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the land women are always happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there is also that too.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the height of the rent.</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drug or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Of which there are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Since there are not even a regular weekly market, it is the more important that us get at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because all the goods offered there are fresh, mostly directly from the producers and is observing clean.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop transactions will be rented in a shopping mall only of larger firms, for rent is often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special stores are almost no longer and what is still left, then will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fit for me not.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farms market during construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even when the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or is it possible to drive the ghost bit gallery before, to drive all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>

<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market place, yes, thanks to the mad many - how I find - senseless building projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, that almost unmistakably - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfar and Hair Pieces that you have been sent to Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former Intelligence Analyzer has served a 35-year-old sentence after they publicly put diplomatic news about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resembley (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was converted into technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transition and a repellent dissidents whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama, when he was only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from Manning, like someone with these genomic data could not only be created for the formability of DNA data - the many wise men, as they can be interpreted and the infirmament Determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been speaking to the identification of woman as wife, was condemned in 2013 because of 20 acquisitions, including six violations of the spy law, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white selfie, in which Manning sits clearly on a driver's seat and carries a platelblonde with which it was associated with.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg arrived just from the great success of their 2012-Project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette mumbs and chewing gum, extracted from the waste to produce a picture of how these people can look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when it received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg declared a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time, and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were sent to unequal letters that had several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They called even one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Supplied images," which would be a future predictable in which the President of Chelem would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama would actually only be a few days after the book was released, Manning was sentenced to seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also at the opening of the exhibition slightly deep and Starkes, because Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transit forces to find new, tweaks to find the rigid circuits, which he should actually fix, continue to flaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg, after the strange Timing of all these things, she said that "things happen in a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for Manning with her oversized signature (that "i" in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end of the "automatic shredder, the basis of gender, breed, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrical DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As in a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, with the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nuglutotid after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how remarkably similar, at least in biological ways, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will have hopefully take away that our gene doesn't take care of what we are, and how to subjectively they are," Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, trace Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a private room, is a page from the top mentioned comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as they appear in hand-free-free efelefon in the hand of the disciplines of the United States, like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I can still see geese, if I don't talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of the masks, from their own genomic simulas, as hordes of protestants.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), where their genetic happoints were written with a pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent company makes custom-made "Pulse" polls, confidential answers to real time and watch the warmth maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with the employee sluggish behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is included, complaints can go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has recorded the Regulators" "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and Managing Director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or unethical, it may experience precious consequences by consumers-boycott, employees of workers and complaints, said qulan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 associates and over 500 locations, Convercent has been used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures, and a simple way to have their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if a salary wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail to the headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an enact and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tua General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to pursue complaints from employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent has problems, problems which were sitting by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or countries - how discrimination, insult, or unlauer interns have been identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can look closer to this integer, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," says Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders before employment laws."</seg>
<seg id="2231">The company began to take ethics, assets and employees in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" Social Media "" "" came to their right, "" "" the company knew that they could not prevent the dirty plunderwear online. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitoring the ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint as well as convercent offer your software as a service, and simplify the company with recurring fees for use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the venture capital investors who both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and earned its total financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, in view of the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is an increasing complex of research, which shows that today's employees expect from their jobs more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites when her portfolio companies run well. companies run well, when employees are working and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics support third parties agree to increase commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if there's no action to take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees according to your feedback, it may have a anticipation that a change is in the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can chase disappointments and employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company to be very pleased to collect data.</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who is now running a monthly employee polls, was able to run measures on the same day when a problem is reported via Glint, so is salvation.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to organise several teams within the company's decision and to add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights on the staff, and it hopes that a long view of workers in a industry leads to a better binding of workers in a sector.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose human beings," says Vitrano.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was hatch for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-1980 and 1980-1980.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced a turbulent history of its homely seat in the Bel River Valley in Kent and is now available for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshiman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of somebody who has been dead for 300 years," he says wehone accord.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so with ancient papers that it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England, and almost four months in a castle ("to be honest: I have a little overvalued") it seems to be nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle to study the archives and the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monasterous hymes were spent on walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscape couples, gardener, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received its full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>

<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go to go! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter a wider basis in the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which leaves a man, who left the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar which occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant class began in this area and I thought, a rebellion was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps are the two linked together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Jesuit seven years during the British Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell dating back to the 18th century, having filled a sarg with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his sarg was excavated).</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as they thought it can't be missed by 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report about the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start to take their ascension serious.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of breast cancer and the type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people do so funny, but the company deliver every quantity of it, and we will still get much more common," "" "Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>

<seg id="2397">The user can customize his robot also according to its convictions, "and so choose everything from the eye color of the robot on the form of breast cancers until the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will be even more troubled, since many robots are the "personalities" to have a stepford-woman pressed out.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sunduppen have developed to robots with a silicone cone.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot makes it possible for example to adapt its users to the properties that make it attractive, such as relapness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold sex robots with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relapness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," says the website of True Companion.</seg>

<seg id="2405">It can be tired to be fixed in conversation, or she can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many admissible aspects of this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the submitting feminine properties, when one goes a step on Frigid (called here: resideners) Farrah, is troubled at most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site, true Companion Roxxxy, with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>

<seg id="2415">The most striking aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the bondwoman ') are not the graphical images, the swallowed body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic these vision acts.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar Propores).</seg>

<seg id="2426">It is become a binding of the trump era, that the political coils, who have polarized the U.S. voters, have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around the Christmas and harvest of harvest there was in the US newspapers with advice about how to choose killers by the horror of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We recommend it to all of us to beat our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The power of Trumps, families have been noted.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-handed dichterin, who lives in Chicago, and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family, this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me of that unity against a common enemy can have a mighty effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">At Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican transformation, with which they had fought for decades because of the politics, suddenly and very peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to be the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it falls in another connection, that this is also significant risks with itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by trump, but the impress effect of his presidency has the power to move us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "normalisation" and trump, we refer to the grassy way for us that his mittens should not cast out more out of one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is a fricamest long-time scenario, in the trump Republicans of the right wing "normalised," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as a concept of distortion.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romantic version of the declining - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least knew we knew how his tax returns) - both occur as a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans must be very healthy, to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousine was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Karussells of New York park department, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city when you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, fiberglass-designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisy and the animals rotate, in order to watch full fear of their own shoulders - extreme dark and limpering music that gives this on a strange manner.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappointing: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are to be familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not just a dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five-five years later, and I'm still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience since two years old, a 11-year old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store in this week, my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars, before I could draw my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In coffee from the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option to make an average of 15% tip - this to buy something about charging.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This leads not only to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also a pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no required is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was disappointing while I get tired of experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to the hospital</seg>

<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night intruder who hidden himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say that she is very dense.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The national prosecution Authority said that they will be able to raise an objection to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the claim can be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius runs at risk that his sentence is further increased to 15 years when the attorneys are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Rotate meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based protein and dairy products, the symptoms of patients could be inflamed.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300,000, causes stomach crats and blowers, recurring or bloody crimes, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers usually come to avoid their symptoms, researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins, which promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The executive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immunity in the Darm patrol to ensure that harmful microbes to hide themselves in food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, who are able to resolve inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far transferred to inflammation, it may result in anti-inflammatory perdition.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a certain type of tolerance has immune cell in mice that a particular bacterium in its bowels carry.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins in order to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine, and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice of their food, the more they had this immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptophan tolerant diet tolerant, less anti-inflammatory mitigus, if the same system also work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctor in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan sought a kind of immune cell that had been found out that a group of study powers had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, which had not yet been accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They thought that the difference with the gut microbiomen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the stomach intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The Därme of mice were found DNA sequenced, and there were six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells, but without it lacked with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were made up in a sterile environment, so that a gut microbiom was missing and this type of immune cells were not developed, and they were given the Crucii and Immuncells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria used to grow on the immune system, the researchers welcomed L. reuteri in a fluid and then led small quantities of the liquid - without the bacterial cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant conveyor cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component is purified from the liquid, it proved to be a secondary product of tryptophan-Metabolism, known as the Indol-3-dairy acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but when the tryptopper were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barrada declared that people have the same tolerated transport of cells as mice, and that most of us L. Cruteri, in our stomach intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if tryptophan-by-products from L. Cruteri's cells are so developing as with mice, but defects in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially can lead high tryptopper values in the presence of L. reuteri to an extensive of these population. "</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter was issued in Connecticut with a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House designed the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the Helicopter Helicopter Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2873">But if they try to sign up one of our players, they will have consequences. "</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona also seems to have exceeded this line, the Spanish association beginning this summer interest in the PSG-midfielder Marco Verratti express.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG did clearly that they would not allow it to travel from Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by increasing their price offers for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-report, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger,"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report to the abuse of abuse of Pope George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report of the abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weiser, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," explained to the release of the German press agency, and acquired Cardinal Gerhard Müller Müller, as well as the Pope Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very serve the appearance of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would have deepening their own omissions on their own omissions or their time false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican City of Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, however, criticised that the coverage of violence with" two measures "must be measured in the reporting.</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regards to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubted that it would be punished and prevented in the future, but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">The principalities also in Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one likes to go on to the church and that's a fine Fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">Moreover, she pointed out that in her youth, "beats a quite normal pedagogical resources," to be finished with freeing children, as I was one to be finished. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They fires it unfair, present standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger was often dipped.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Totally wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was translated with Ratzinger, "My Brother of Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection" "" "says Hemann," for all this had nothing to do with him, "" "" he evaluates the results of the final report. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which is presented by the bishopric of Regensburg with the Enlightenment of the lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 regiments were sexually abused with high Plausivity "victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen sexually abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can hold on that from Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of forms of physical and mental violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even in high emotion, the punishment for the pupils could be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other regulatory evidence, that many victims had been rated by R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hemann, why the final report to the abuse of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger declares his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents from the" prejudicators "in the Regensburger Domspatzen" is a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for a lifting many students" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as cholesterol and Perfection, who was able to handle the öfteren when a domain kit produced musically no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if one reads the trouble and the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask for why the name of Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is devoted to him just eight pages and it is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of the mediafore or mitigship in the terrible cases of sexual abuse are acquitted.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence of violence in the school took place outside of its impact sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can't want to mention it, of which too late or have taken first clarifications seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Dominion grammar grammar grammar, which he was active, was told by practically all those questioned - "redemption," heaven "and" better world. "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "so the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes it as" "" "warm" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "" worked regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and "" "" always surrounded by grapes of children. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high emotion, which led to Wutausbrüchen.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he has not only cast out with chairs and cast the key captives on the ground, but also earnecks distributed guys to hair or ears he has already been given back for years, deeply regret and to excuse them.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his honorary doctor, however, must have been said that such corrections were widespread in the fray period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents, such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us was born 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a worldly school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what about it is in this report, namely, the alleged sexual abuse and the nonviolence in the school, the release of Bagatellen are.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There is no one to say whether it's not rather with its popularity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI to do that many media had just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood it, still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report of Georg Ratzinger's report in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report it was reported very much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domain.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will also put on a load on sexual abuse in terms of sexual abuse in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite no no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have committed the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I've never looked about to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said one of them" "" "said," "" "I was very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a fragmented student formulated like this: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no event, in which it was possible (Georg Ratzinger), and could have had the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I remember it... also for really absurd to accept that... Buben insistence or clearer or more often opened, as opposed to their parents, internators, confidentistry, confidentistry, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">In this way, the report comes to the very clear result: "that the subject of affected students and / or their environment was not confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">So what is sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is to release from every fellow workers.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be charged, nor prevented him or have brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradicted crimes in connection, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "violence" "" "in the media" "" "" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of having been accused of having" "" "Wegner" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this design?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the great problem that in the reporting, it has been mixed and mixed up to a giant melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"" "" "" "there will be clean separately: between the school and grammar school children, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as we say once, other preaches." ""</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report dates from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger had not been chorus of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible testing of pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sawest teachers were irrigated and malignited, all of them were defeated at the school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skinous states have to have ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he did not get the boys only when they were already at the Dominion grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On this one was, as most of the most witnesses, the theme "Preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was at the domain rate grammar?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no sadisturbances.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims had the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at the most still the throw, chained.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just began to establish itself and from their predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) would not hear, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Do Georg Ratzinger flowed in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dominion grammar school, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">He pointed out this to them, "that in the pre-school the test sentence will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the risk of negative press structures, it is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2966">It was of course that, at a time as a legal clarity, was also banned as an auditor in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Prior to that, they occurred in a legal gray zone, as everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult to estimate him, where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic, where really the permitted limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say too, he could always be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">It simply is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the German testing of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principalities in Gloria of Thurn and Taxis maintained it was unfair, that today's pedagogical standards apply to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak historians since the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," so the danger to evaluate to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">And the principalities already has been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true of course, of course, not for sexual abuse, which was absent for all times and was also broken down to innocent children of innocent children, that goes far beyond that of the time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all quite dreadful and I am glad that it is finally finished.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to the disciplines and punishment, so ear to draw and ears to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When the physical punishment had been banned, he also has kept it on it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "" "" "what image of its Regensburger period has been" "" "My Brother of Pope" "" "in the discussions with you for the book" "" "My Brother of Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing also to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: now, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI's life, tells of his perspective, since the domains played just a side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I didn't forget that he led a regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without these perfect discipline, it would probably hardly ever been possible to form a institution of world trang, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons alone, one does not make any major singers and before each success, just in which area, but discipline, passion and self-windowment.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As for a person, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger at the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really good and always experienced as a wonderful, humorous, deep faithful and heartily people, from which you can't imagine that it could be a little bit too much.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domspatzen still get in contact with him today, 23 years after his Emergency, regularly contact him, attend to him - he is almost blind - and him treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him up to this day, so that he was strictly strictly to them, so they are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are now thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, vitalian teacher - a controversial father, certain that may be, but also a loving Respectosson, to which they still have seen, and honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly stated: everything one has throws him, corrective methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because it is prominently and has a major brother to make a medial fall.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the wicked intention that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just released, was discharged him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now, the lawyer would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had gained great achievements and without leaving out the outside of Bavaria and probably in Germany would probably be able to get the regression of the cathedral in peace.</seg>
