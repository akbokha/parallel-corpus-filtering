this is the Hollywood star in an interview tried un@@ am@@ big@@ uous .
&quot; I will always put in drawers or put from the outside label , which is usually little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successfully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pil@@ es of stones
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of the Golf tournaments in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variation with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
Chi@@ o : &quot; gold sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes , the horses remembered their closing evening , they pursued after the fast gal@@ lo@@ p at home to the feeding of the feeding .
one kilometer near this temp@@ o , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and that ended up the e@@ quest@@ ers , then again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he had to lead himself with his family over the installation of AL@@ RV , on a horse he s@@ lang not for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus at Chi@@ o .
the reason was quite impressive .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe gave the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala to the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
I don &apos;t lack of awards in the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver bay leaf , champ@@ ions @-@ tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already warned him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction is very much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been supporting the offspring since decades .
and so he gave the price of EUR 25,000 in the same way .
with 15 more outstanding sports athletes won the two @-@ time US Mast@@ ering winner on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
the names are the athletes of Hart@@ wig G@@ ien@@ ger , Alexander P@@ ush and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank W@@ ien@@ e@@ ke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank W@@ ien@@ e@@ ke , the sprinkl@@ er Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the craft of all Erhard .
many of these sports were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society emigrated to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic policy in comparison : IT &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - that would like to prevent both Clinton as well as tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidate , however , are at the tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosop@@ hi@@ cal difference .
who , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in a doubt rather small and war@@ ns before , as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation .
Clinton encouraged the economy to death and regulate the economy to death , he says .
on the other hand , it would be different , claimed tr@@ ump .
he will return regulation massi@@ vely , and it is powerful for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax principles , for private people and for companies .
Clinton says : the state has given certain tasks to meet himself , he has to open the discrimination of the discrimination and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich would be increased , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
to be invested in the needs , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost what is the same .
the democratic candidates announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and will be rejected by the state @-@ rit@@ es @-@ wing @-@ wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so , at Tr@@ ump , could still be part@@ iti@@ oned with internal discussions .
clari@@ fying are the differences in energy and climate policies .
tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal extraction in the USA .
oil extraction should also be possible to terminate in the area of protected areas in the Paris climate agreement .
Clinton , against its investment program , Clinton wants to expand and calls for : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it . &quot;
but not only at the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , these two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ scri@@ bed business agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both the USA do not want to isol@@ ate the international trade - but just better protect American jobs .
then they should be paid better , calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger of hunger .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what tr@@ ump is to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be , then he says , he should not be changed .
however , the major discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy from the two camps .
on one side , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and the citizens to stim@@ ulate growth .
his critics keep him before , that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand Clinton stands Clinton who wants to ask for at least of the rich , that they will pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has gained experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are alone to flee almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each baby has a baby with a maximum of one year old .
one has put her small son into the arm .
he gu@@ essed with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table top .
until they notice that she is watching .
you sm@@ iles shortly and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Katrin B@@ ahr .
it is the President of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a bear@@ ers for social and offers in Bavaria , and is dealing among others with the subject of women on the flight .
the four women in the kitchen are che@@ er@@ ful .
they live in Munich , Germany , in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Sagrada Familia and Munich &apos;s office .
it has been officially opened in recently .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man from the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who comes here has done on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted , because of them torture or death or because their families send them as a hopes to Europe , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many do not steal of them , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in her home , they have experience with sexu@@ alized violence , forced labor@@ ers , slavery or forced prost@@ itution .
this drives you away .
on the escape goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the tu@@ g@@ boats demand for a bottle of water a sexual action is no rarity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that when they come to Germany as soon as they come to Germany , do not think .
the women in refugees too often would be considered as infer@@ ior and mis@@ chief if necessary .
that means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in Munich , are trau@@ mat@@ ised , estimates it .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are as usual , that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not trust , openly about the living things , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since she often didn &apos;t help to help , then there are more accommodations only for them , calls B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District rule in Bavaria are responsible for the refugees of refugees .
on the question whether they like from a similar project like in Munich in their in@@ comprehen@@ sion area , some answers with No .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not so anything in self @-@ catering flats in the governments .
also in Schw@@ aben , women alone cannot be accommodated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press conference of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Central fran@@ ken , there are places in some common areas or houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central properties available exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately of men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published for the Committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; there is missing the privacy or men and women together , it can come to - for@@ ging violence against women . &quot;
above all , the shower room should be easily accessible and accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women feel the need of this protection , one can read the rush , which gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; since he has been around since it has been around us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily make a second house .
assistance of assist@@ ants : demands on new labour measures
Deputy @-@ representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to auth@@ ori@@ ze new labour measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) appro@@ ve its entire Council to appro@@ ve more working measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that there had been a minister of ministers to enter the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , an assistant of assistance and media studies have been coordinated with the BM@@ A which has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained calm &quot; problems , which led the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of what the J@@ DC board has voted , the proposed new contract completely to reject and official new negotiations led to all kinds of har@@ lots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has set a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to auth@@ ori@@ ze an ongoing program of regulatory operations that begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes led by the assistance of this year resulted in six times , the first overall results in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A Assistant Minister , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election of the agreed contractual conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and media inst@@ ances , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hunt that the contract would lead to doctors in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey arrived on Tuesday to announce their hands and to publish the official end of the eight months of the words of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish defender in the gold @-@ g@@ ild@@ ed hall of the St. Petersburg palace in reception , I cannot withstand this reconciliation , that Ankara is the prop@@ iti@@ ation of reconciliation .
there was the wr@@ inkl@@ es , yes .
but Put@@ into sm@@ iles worked nar@@ row@@ ly and he sh@@ ined hardly any heat , even for his aff@@ ection conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , he said repeatedly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better .
the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard that the Earth would never happen anything .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate rather the opposite .
but one of Putin was able to show sustainable cooling , that the Russian state of Russia had nothing forgotten .
rather the cause of the crisis was the first , what he mentioned in its introduc@@ tory statement : the surplus of a Russian campaign by the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ aking up .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to have fallen in the back .
even though it was even bigger , since it was committed by a familiar friend .
this is hard to build up again , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media conducted a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
once it seemed , the Turks would wear for all the bl@@ ame .
on the serious dis@@ gu@@ essing officials , Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he was cont@@ ested by this .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place therefore , because Putin received the withdrawal from the President of Erdo@@ gan , who wanted to hear .
Russia was able to make a way victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a tru@@ ce , clearly on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan takes the first line to all the friends that he can get after the last month of a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat close to his ministry .
again , terrorist attacks on Turkey had also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions did not hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of Char@@ ter@@ ns that every year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the amount of the amount is decreased by almost 90 % .
tour operators and char@@ gers will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resum@@ ed in Russia .
they count on a delayed ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week , the State TV endor@@ sed fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports come back .
a report published in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i as follows : &quot; tourists here long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is w@@ ret@@ ched to the West , because the response to the attempted power of power was considered the weak answer .
to do this , the persistent g@@ roll of the EU accession negotiations for accession to the EU &apos;s accession negotiations and Putin - the er@@ pi@@ ke is to go out of cool sen@@ timent and decrease the relation of Turkey to the west .
the Russian state of government won a bonus in Ankara with security , that he requested a coup d &apos;@@ etat for the elected state of state organs .
this is a self @-@ comprehen@@ sible for Moscow , which even has a deeper fear of reg@@ im@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this glorious palace built on the sea in Russia and Turkey , such as an analy@@ st once described me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of external sides &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries that have driven away from the west , and it is now banned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still major differences between both of the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey were able to support each other .
it could be characteristic that after nearly three hours of first talks , both pre@@ sidents on the press conference said that they could not have experienced the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president of Turkey missing it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size these . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not a clear con@@ sen@@ sus about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member of Turkey shot the Russian batt@@ les@@ jet - it certainly makes it better to talk to two heads at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has since then dist@@ ressed , when she had to be saved almost eight years ago and had to be saved .
in this period , brand new &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumers .
it supported international sport with millions of pound to sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wimbledon champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to move more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland but is not initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and the company &apos;s IPO are changing to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the customer business which will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WA@@ N was inter@@ viewed during a visit of clients and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be at our invest@@ or brand as well as the brand , among which our employees will be employed , since we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank has been a global brand , R@@ BS has been a global trademark .
I say now that we do not track global targets , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own municipalities for something completely different and our employees are working among these brands with the customer .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing anymore , and that it will increase the perception of various brands in its Sport sponsor@@ ing business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop the stamps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for how we are asked ourselves in the inside ( we asked us ) to make it a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Board of Directors said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and they had launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re@@ boot these brands again , therefore I think that the time has come .

Russia &apos;s Putin was Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin was released unexpected by his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of part of the closest trust group of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin opinion that Putin was ordered without giving reasons &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s arranged by its duties as chairman of the Russian pre@@ dial@@ ect . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Ivan@@ ov@@ s for 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he made its completion at the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the officer and Chief Leader of the Government .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support its activities as head of government and controls for implementation of your instructions .
Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov asked that Ivan@@ ov had asked his position to leave his position as his successor .
see the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made a mysterious one .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time in the most eng@@ agements with Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on TV , both men said that the Chief of Staff was back on their own request .
but despite a smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is here the result of a kind of power in front of ?
this is nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once opened as potential President , once the Russian environmental policy was to lead us - he fell on big sk@@ ep@@ sis .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin said Ivan@@ ov , &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you to put this very complex post in early 2012 - it could almost say - compla@@ ined about four years to trust .
as it presents , I have been chairman of the Russian pre@@ dial@@ ect for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , as Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) that was appointed K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his substitute .
as Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people who trusted in most .
once was accepted that Ivan@@ ov would have been president of Russia for Putin &apos;s second term , as a third @-@ term coup would have put off against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , near allies Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister , before he became President three and a half years later .

ri@@ dd@@ les for fish , which landed in garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff demanded the identification of the fish that appeared in its garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be 75 fishes around San@@ da@@ ale , which were cut out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spect@@ acle in hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Queens@@ land Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the north deck of the Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - what means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four del@@ ays in the &quot; covers , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 s@@ lan@@ ders .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Finance K@@ eith Brown took the construction site today a visit and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment of construction of the Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings .
we are all witness of a engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a he@@ ats , which require extremely precise tolerances for fit .
a total of almost 79 % of the whole Br@@ ush@@ es are on their place and the last part of the Dec@@ ks now gets on Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ ated for the deck that means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first closure has a significant milestone in each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of the pioneering high and deep building represents .
following the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the North Sea @-@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap in the North or Land@@ side .
this was reached by pulling in the northern access bridge of 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and very heated activity .
massi@@ vely because the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 metres long , about 6,000 tons weighs and had to be pulled down at a gradient of about 3 % .
uncle , as the tolerances to which the team works , tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have to be lucky enough to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have still alive to be alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having been thrown away from her fishing boat at Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T al@@ ert , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim in safety while their boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned back to himself , and set us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have been rest@@ rained from their range , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a boat without li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastline and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck , and have not yet been alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot motor had an emergency stop@@ pl@@ ings , however , it dis@@ band@@ ed with the bo@@ ilers of the Bo@@ ots from the person who contributed to the boat .
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
seriously wounded - man bl@@ ended up his ex @-@ friend
one man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife , and severely injured .
as the police posted yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to get the apartment to get his personal stuff .
instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ rators cut the clothes of his ex @-@ friend .
when they came into the apartment , he put twice on them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and in the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rator .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ ar@@ ous@@ ed his sister .
together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down their brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her partner from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ lifetime of the husband .
when the two women meet the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old turned his sister to the side and took his ex @-@ friend .
who builds brown silence apartments ?
the SPD and Green : investors will get to be much stronger in future .
how does it react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action concept for the next meeting . &quot;
but war is programmed .
first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the favourable apartments actually ?
one regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking forward to the Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to build urban areas , in future 20 percent of all apartments have to show as social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the inexpensive apartments can also occur in stock .
but the great reas@@ oning in the town hall is , however , viol@@ a : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such surfaces at least 10 per cent , but as possible as 20 per cent of dwellings as social dwellings . &quot;
a new urban housing funding program , which will cost € million and has to be financed , is to be inc@@ enti@@ ves for inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors a few rules .
the left does not want to add hardness levels for investors .
in spite of this , as the Brat@@ un@@ er , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the residential market .
the concept of the action is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the program does not stand completely , because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built @-@ in .
but how does one compare the loss of further around 1300 low apartments whose promotion is going out in the next few years ?
there will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
to prevent this , the planning for speaking spokes@@ person in Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city now .
in addition , it would have to be thought to get back home again in the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
one stroke the problem .
because in the west city , the dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get there back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this will not want the owners , the housing units are not .
because the number of social dwellings in the western city is dra@@ stically increased again , one remov@@ es away from the goal of the so @-@ called flow .
a concentration of social weak in just a few districts is to give it more .
the Gre@@ ens indicate that there will be even more movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
namely , I have focused on more places for family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a compromise could not be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting trip to health and happiness , worth it
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
the te@@ ens and child to play no more after going outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , on screens , was be@@ mo@@ zed in the last decade of many .
for Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it is possible to pick up people from the sofa and let it be active .
the time at the screen was initially limited to TV , then limited to video games and last on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and activities are not able to exclu@@ de each other .
I &apos;m sure of course based on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later produced a character set , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenomena of Pop@@ culture sank the interest before the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand early July .
the market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within less days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than men and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players take their smartphone out without and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who are pursued after a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot of the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jum@@ ped to the search of the sofa .
in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ki , an app for Apple Watch that pursued 35,000 users , shared that Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the market launch of the game , the number of people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance increase .
many public clari@@ fication campaigns for health , who want to bring about &quot; 30 minutes of time to come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are bor@@ ing to health and look of people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the significance of sport can not be over@@ rated .
who regularly drives Sport , reduces his chances to treat cancer or depression .
physical activity helps to share high blood pressure , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list , which is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , that makes them fun .
there are three pillars covered in health - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people do not exclu@@ de new friends on the hunt .
as always there are m@@ acro@@ ric gam@@ ble , which must always be chargeable to something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it ?
it is a breakthrough for himself .
even if smartphone apps , such as Fit@@ bit already could follow our activity , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its matur@@ ation and the use will be re@@ located at the time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will be united to apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , and help many people in the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ast@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is at all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now at last also the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their total income of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly held in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; manna in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American woman Simone Bil@@ es fell on the Swedish bar during the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Kunst@@ tur@@ nes during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ .@@ It is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign wins and altogether the fifth , while she established their reputation , the best of its generation or even at all .
they broke out in tears , when their final score was shown and her long journey was found at that moment .
this success puts it into the same league like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought her sports on new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates its sport , 15 world champion - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou &apos;s rescue from her said that she has ever seen &quot; the best g@@ ymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final exam in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a last over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a handful of gold to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered to be dis@@ appointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ce , after they were each with gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Kunst@@ tur@@ nes during the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal at Tuesday , while on the party ceremony , retired teams coordin@@ ator in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi was served as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on the top of its long distance to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
part of its ground exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music - at home outside the Olympic Games in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip into the g@@ ymnasi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a multi @-@ fight competition , a winning stre@@ ak , which will take as long as it wishes .
even when pe@@ af@@ ina led by two rot@@ ations , the image was broken .
pig @-@ beams and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which image keeps the world title - listen .
she returned again with 15.@@ 433 on the Swedish bar again - and with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still one on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced them gently as she did her En@@ der@@ ive permit - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they once became reality in their collection book .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 year old man &apos;s chapel mentioned by Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after their soil practice , she cast down the audience of the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which is sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful .
what makes it concerns , then the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning of this week :
police : 3 victims in production accident at the music in the car ...
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot in one of the deadly attack since one decade in the first production accident of Phoenix while they stopped working in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a ride , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ weapon , while it stood on the passenger side of the car and fled to another vehicle , is to read in the report .
the police reported that the triple murder does not seem to be the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ors , since the att@@ ack@@ ers didn &apos;t take care of the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police officers of Phoenix S@@ g@@ . Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ator has led the investig@@ ator to become an immediate view whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in H@@ isp@@ anic residential neighbor@@ hoods in nine months in nine attacks and two more injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same murderer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised in due to its injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting at an empty pic@@ up truck to a half hour before triple murder and was assumed that it was the work of the serial tower .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ recipes : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of its aging , Edmund Micro@@ c@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder which knew about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I made it not .
I do not create that .
I didn &apos;t let it leave .
what not true at all -- of course , one has left behind it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her was informed that Edmund will never know them under circumstances , and that he may not survive once .
some doctors went even so far away that they proposed to be institutional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first response was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help of a hearing aid .
Edmund could neither sit cro@@ oked up to the age of his third year , nor can still talk .
but he is making slowly progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he loves to play with his two brothers and to sing .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we express his language to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical string -- says it . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
micro @-@ hal@@ ie has a variety of causes : genetic such as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as mas@@ ons or Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus In@@ spec@@ tion .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds on the emotional price of an unexpected future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time longer after the forecast , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ ed rating for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rain cr@@ ashes , floods there &apos;s cause to rescue rescue in Louis@@ iana , Mississippi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ sized floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to call on Friday the emergency . it is reck@@ oned to the whole Saturday above with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Louis@@ ian@@ as and the south of the village flooded their banks and threatened with large floods , the national weather service reported .
the governor of Louis@@ iana John Bel Edwards divided in permanent contact with the local authorities and on the help of the affected municipalities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , divided the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand bags .
Ste@@ ele said that alone , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa ten thousand sand bags would have requested .
a flood system is used across wide parts in the south Louis@@ ian@@ as to Saturday .
the weather service caused that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Alab@@ ama , a Fl@@ ut@@ earliest system was used on Friday , while it rained in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , are reaching a record level of all probability after the weekend .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ flooded many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , since these rivers are slowly flowing into the Lake Mo@@ rep@@ as .
the river ticket , south of the Mississippi River in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level at 09.00 on Friday at 09.00 .
rescue teams still move people from the rivers in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son , were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that Water by Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , strongly increased by night .

&quot; we are awak@@ ened and the water pour in , he said H@@ ans@@ ford , &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford .
it reached my waist .

H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ ise had saved all three in a big military truck and had brought them to the next fire @-@ watch in Glo@@ ster , where they were up to Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had rapidly stretched &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there was heavy rain accidents and that the authorities will consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floor has been considerably full since Wednesday .
the authorities admitted that heavy rainf@@ alls and road flooded the rescue of inhabitants out of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching in five subject areas .
the C@@ BS @-@ dependent WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 over@@ flooded the houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , both flooded and flooded .
the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets delivered by the floo@@ ding .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency information were set up in order to accommodate the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water begins to return , they will return to their houses again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa almost two dozen streets were closed and sand @-@ sow@@ ing for the residents to capture that we hope the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last big flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal authorities .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in a joint , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it rained on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as a flooded , but on Friday they have been reported until now .

Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by spher@@ es , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police indicates that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already became the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as a Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents found that Brown was not allowed to be more vulner@@ able violations , including leg , arm , and belly , but that he was at his transport to the hospital at consciousness .
&quot; he has done much through the small body of spher@@ es , &quot; he divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boys were classified as critical in a hospital , and he had to undergo several operations .
the boys of the boys divided the transmitter that it is likely to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
the young was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is located in a critical condition , shot up the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police were determined , whether under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators gave the C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross fire between several sho@@ oters .
pat@@ ron@@ age con@@ du@@ cks for assault ri@@ f@@ les , which were tra@@ ced back to various storm tissue , s@@ add@@ les the tat@@ too .
it seems that it was clearly acted for a lasting fight .
on the road , on both sides of the walking distance , envel@@ opes could be found .
in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; divided police Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several homes and vehicles were met in the territory .
there came no evidence and the police currently checks according to reports , according to reports .
on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a tas@@ k@@ illings at the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Palm Lan@@ e .
it recovered and the police are looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I am present under the Women &apos;s Olympic Games in Tur@@ nen in Tur@@ nen and this is more than one reason .
first of all , I have been at every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ders , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is round , makes everyone proud .
this crew finally reflects the US .
it has been the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one was one of the female tur@@ ner@@ ders a A@@ fr@@ o American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprisingly Olympic champion in and America .
now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , but master@@ y of Gy@@ ma@@ ison@@ ous rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won with an individual multi @-@ concert event for women of gold .
Mann@@ a member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are going to experience the top of this sport , but this turn@@ around classes do not see in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four tur@@ ner@@ ders in the crew . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as train@@ ee .
but the reality sees that Tur@@ ns are a more expensive sport and Turner first line in private turn@@ tables that are exciting for their training , educational , travel and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . the list can be extended individually .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are lying in wealthy suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the Turner will receive its entire training and this is a expensive and long term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the Tur@@ nen .
we must in@@ numer@@ able the churches of Au@@ n in@@ numer@@ able , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to enable an un@@ accessible and easily accessible turn@@ table .
I was founded my g@@ ymnasi@@ um of 20 years .
with my events , we have free and affordable tur@@ mo@@ ons in Harlem for over 15,000 urban adolescents ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) were trained and national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to provide the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ mo@@ ons to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
tur@@ nes developed strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for professional and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ mo@@ ons and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
it &apos;s an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Holocaust Team World team and thank you for so many young girls with a different background motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .

&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act , lift up the condition and concerns the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot;

Daniel Mor@@ tim@@ ers , Director of the N@@ HS , urged the assistance to quit the strike .

culture of the Association of Cor@@ ect@@ ness allows you to blos@@ som in the Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the mis@@ sal of a government report due to corruption from the office
a culture of the Russian Cor@@ ect@@ ness led to this fact that widespread vote was ignored in Muslim communities , like a devastating government report today .
the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacked the police , election observ@@ atory and Town H@@ ouses to have evidence of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ n@@ ities regarding eth@@ never and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now a ant@@ in@@ corruption of religious motives such as that it should be allowed to establish the police outside of elec@@ tr@@ ines outside of elec@@ toral cabins .
he recommends that voters should prove an ID card in order to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment , a vot@@ er has to call its name and address .
the report suggests , not removable ink on the fingers of a person if they vote to vote , to prevent any one twice .
Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , Sir Eric .
he requires that the press should have access to the community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committee or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was not only against the election , but also the municipal government is to protect the wider corruption and financing culture , which we go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election as the east of London .
last year , a special com@@ ration Court decided that the am@@ end Mayor of Rah@@ man decided to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have had the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal manner and fashion , and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ judi@@ c@@ ements to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that the cor@@ related obligation of Muslims is to choose it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a neighbor where one person is chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of the whole country of deceit .
he appe@@ aled especially al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent mail code - in the older members of the Muslim community print on people , choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to cleanse the elec@@ toral system , including the gui@@ ding of commands to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as proof was the proof that pressure on the protection of some ethnic minorities was administered , in particular women and young people , in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or b@@ ang@@ j@@ aw@@ ning background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such as the conduct of &quot; politically correct &quot; overseas matters concerning eth@@ never and religion ignored . &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to su@@ ck@@ le the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist letters will work to stop &quot; election . &quot;
the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May in order to prevent even tough@@ er registration tests to prevent that the election of immigration is used for immigration and social purposes .
options to consider , voters will be able to ask of the election according to your ID card .
do not want to use ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent any one twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to perform , to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to orders on an automatic mail @-@ election .
a ban that political activ@@ ist can process full operation and envel@@ opes from mail@@ box .
the police give the authority to establish pol@@ ls for elec@@ ting stations .
a change of law which facilitates the indictment due to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Representative Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing banned in elec@@ ting stations .
request that only English must be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule the rule , the voters will enter the constitu@@ ent cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no penalty .
&quot; the Elect@@ oral court has been Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ igation of corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ ill , &quot; he said .
due to a number of reasons for insufficient - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - pleaded not guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the election registration in the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the trial part in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of Parliament a proud and covered spread of pol@@ ar@@ ities and leu@@ k@@ ation of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

but the 24 @-@ year Olympic Olymp@@ ian in this summer is by far not the only one for gold fighting athl@@ ete who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not even if you give the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ ic risks , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood @-@ famous games .
h@@ unter and Wolf : man @-@ member of the U.S. team in Ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
except K@@ ates double viol@@ inist on the bicycle route , lots of people on the Internet , like a certain she@@ er of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a look@@ out on Twitter after pictures where he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly .
in fact , the she@@ er got the ma@@ dness in the social media and gave it to him that he has already received his childhood as Leo looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see a great simil@@ arity with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , divided Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess that probably as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur more into the centre : the most striking simil@@ arity between the British Far East Ru@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its great , expres@@ sive eyes will be able to pass as a double @-@ person for the Cuban US singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh was compared with the G@@ lee star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ ers
another comparison of the comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h hard , who has very severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal floating in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ born skin and bl@@ onde hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , during the Americans , Nathan was Adrian from fans , a &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope , Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial form and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy about that others also have fallen similar to the simil@@ ar@@ ities
theory is provided in the room : according to this user , there are perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter almost identical almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Hope and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter has an incredibly similar fac@@ ial form and eyes .

buyer in Pri@@ mark reb@@ ates about woman who tried in the middle of the business
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman moved her clothing in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try to try under@@ p@@ ants .
to wor@@ sens the situation , numbered them , as they looked out , she went out , and put them back into the shelf .
they watched on and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ stone .
the Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place center in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tested the under@@ p@@ ants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried her under@@ wear , &quot; she got up and left the business without buy something . &quot;
she said , &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of sub @-@ tro@@ users from the outlet , moved their own shr@@ ubs and tro@@ users .
&quot; they did not even try to find a somewhat discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch as O@@ skar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every star@@ ved , when she returned to the under@@ p@@ ants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , since they put it into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three additional sub @-@ tro@@ users , before it finally decided that you had nothing right , and went out .
&quot; she seemed not to distur@@ b that they observed someone or about the person who had to buy under@@ p@@ ants who had tried them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in Kent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would have tro@@ users at home , who had a different person and had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ d@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to pull out the clothes out of the sale after they went - what &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sub@@ tro@@ users to go home and find out that another woman had left her and didn &apos;t have been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is referring to the event that occurred on Tuesday 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from the arms
the world without is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to get out by armed rob@@ bers .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn your rob@@ bers to the sk@@ e@@ wers .
if you arrive at the rear , then you should be sure to turn your att@@ ack@@ ers , so that you can catch your att@@ ack@@ ers and proceed to &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the gun between your front and your shoulder , before you hit your face with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knees with the knee and rotate it , while the att@@ ack@@ ers from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back , while they move the weapon on him .
at att@@ ack@@ ers who are approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the scra@@ p line , take the weapon and rotate it , so that the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot them .
at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and strike the att@@ ack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle before moving forward and judge the weapon .
sounds difficult ?
see the video to see exactly how to make Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a prey on the saf@@ est , your money is sufficient - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel Ian Wright sch@@ t for a guide in his tongue to the most so@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller moved his immune system and wor@@ ti@@ sts of a serious examination - by giving some of the most tast@@ es and brigh@@ ter places in Europe .
the Moder@@ ator and Tra@@ velo@@ ator Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk , a rail@@ ing at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dish@@ washing button of a ten@@ sile toil@@ ette and a public telephone in Russia in order to ensure the resistance of his immune system .
in front of any object , he used a rag @-@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he will be embar@@ ked .
but the experiment , under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results of daylight .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a pulling toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely shock , but actually there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of int@@ est@@ inal bacteria as well as through its own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , nothing left what he stretched out , more than a bad breath in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became well @-@ known to test the resistance of his Dar@@ ms by entering the world as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ways to train stations up to dish@@ w@@ ah@@ em of toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ wor@@ ried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ amm@@ ate water . &quot;
in the film he was righteous in his call .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ of@@ ing showed a thickness of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ometric population is fresh used less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to ref@@ using , after their L@@ umin@@ ometric population was more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products V@@ ali@@ o produced the travel movie &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number at different locations like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; this comes the worst thing that I had in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing dirt more than that !
I will do nothing here , because it &apos;s inside inside there .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products V@@ ali@@ o .
the company pays Mr Wright with V@@ ali@@ o Ne@@ us , which contains both Mil@@ il@@ actic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of int@@ est@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
V@@ ali@@ os senior Venice President for snacks , sa@@ wing and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a : &quot; we wanted to find the consumer really something new .
something that is fascinating for viewing and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ic .
we introduced the crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings , so that we finished , &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of the gut health and how they are associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting manner .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say , &quot; I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he would have felt some of the things that I have told him , like the ek@@ y Russian toilet , which will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things , with which it was easier to bring Ian , and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty jobs on film . &quot;
in one of the survey carried out by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents questioned with the well@@ being of stomach and int@@ estine , and 58 percent said that they have at least occasionally products that contain l@@ actic acid bacteria .

she said , &quot; It was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , since this estate is thought to be regarded as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ ce .
the family is not@@ orious , and their reputation is it also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in a time in the apartment and the police said that the terror which had added the family , street strug@@ gles with bas@@ ins , drugs , drug abuse , drug abuse , drugs and floods included .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ ese behaviour in June .

these were done in the property , in which the past drugs have been traded , the wooden sl@@ ats have been torn
neighbours said that they saw her on the street , and regularly called the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ated it and her partner this week , violent of the estate , after they had extended a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ er@@ ated by ligh@@ ten neighbors , which told her life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they watched by nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times , which we say to the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not the usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will become nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ aked bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have been able to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the outstanding page of the Municipal House , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that there is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and her family , since a delay always is the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing has been considered .
that was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be terrible to their neighbours .
I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the congregation who are cour@@ ageous to us and have received us the information .
I hope that this development is don@@ ating to some neighbors and conve@@ ys the message that ant@@ is@@ o@@ ese behavior will not be toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were in different times in the house , but they all had about 20 .
the dirty mattress , which is placed in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Del@@ og@@ ation on the floor .
the workers of the household management will now have to we@@ ave the gar@@ bage , which surround the house
the police launched a raid in the house by over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ al@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ don received a fine penalty after it was found guilty of the owners of a Class B drug .
it claimed that the money was a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 at a car accident .
after having been without shelter , Tan@@ ya and her partner is now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ymouth .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will be ten@@ ant to enter in order not to keep the assignment of the assignment .
Angela Cro@@ w by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not keep to the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they may have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without sel@@ f@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as those who were obtained by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ is@@ o@@ ese behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our churches .

Donald Tr@@ ump dream ″ massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans will be pla@@ gued by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditional conservative states their majority .
Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave birth to the weakness of his campaign campaign at the existing Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment , in which the usually big track and self @-@ sure mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is something similar to concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having cast 16 Riv@@ als within his own republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts are growing at his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before Evangelical Christians , which he asked for support in major countries such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
bl@@ ame be false reports on his candidates , he resum@@ ed his familiar media .
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ ners
Ut@@ ah is usually a secure bank for Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitors were rent@@ ers in the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for Republi@@ can Candi@@ dates in the state of the state .
at risk , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
in an interview of the transmitter CN@@ BC he answered Tr@@ ump on the question as he would stop the march Clin@@ t again : &quot; as I did so far . &quot;
and whether to be back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make any other than &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
if the political correc@@ t@@ ness is not rich in order for him on the end of grounds of political correc@@ t@@ ness , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump is alleged to replace funds for the support of his elec@@ toral campaign , it should not be able to present a better conversion values .
instead of him , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans are stronger among the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ster sc@@ am with d@@ oping test
the IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission in the case .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threat@@ ening to the second d@@ oping affair with the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee used to establish the case immediately a discipl@@ in@@ arian Commission to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian function revealed that the former Sprinter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village had a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this would be reported by the team @-@ line Ken@@ yan from the d@@ oping Control@@ lers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has the IOC for information about the case to explo@@ it own investigations , a IA@@ AF speaker with .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will show a review , &quot; it was named in a IA@@ AF Declaration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and signed up as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Red I , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ cred@@ itation of the athletes who stood on the list for training control of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing WM @-@ Vier@@ ter over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athlet@@ ics delegates Michael Rot@@ i was deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
it should be informed against the pending d@@ oping tests for cash payments in his country .
according to media reports , he was arrested in Nairobi at the airport of Nairobi .
the IOC has already been under specific observation by IOC to numerous d@@ oping clubs since longer time .
during the announcement of the IOC more than 2000 d@@ oping targets in front of the Rio games , it was pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being put into the visa .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had exercised a lot of pressure on African countries in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning inspection system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenia took from the list of countries whose d@@ oping @-@ fighting form with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is regarded as big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals in Beijing at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports , the ARD has always been raised again , that in Kenya , d@@ oping funds is easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport .
IOC Member of Richard P@@ ound requested a similar research in Kenya , as he had held them in the Russian Athlet@@ ics Athlet@@ ics .
this could be proven that this sport has been hidden and system@@ atically educated in this sport .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer time .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presenting the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a portable lovers similar to Romeo and Juli@@ as .
with this surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ f@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ einer masterpiece .
the artistic director of Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the Temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuel@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ am@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say that she is a very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and their melody .
it is a wonderful blend , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli is playing a older Mary .
she rec@@ alls with gro@@ m@@ wood with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then it would be Mari@@ as &apos;s personality .
she says in her song , &quot; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is so cle@@ ver , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; it is quite similar to me , my Italian character I have seen as a Roman , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is full of praise for the Opera House : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor to work with her .
she is a monster generous man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
you see it in any of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it goes to pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we had the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ic@@ ans went to New York at that time , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
these are the same topics , and they are the same as well as back as it was then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after her family short after she had to leave the war@@ ri@@ cane to leave the country and to return to England .
&quot; you can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are associated with , to go to a war zone - people have ever met this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , the Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the East London grew into a plane towards Turkey and subsequently entered into a bus to the Syrian border .
the sult@@ anas family has been informed that she had married a IS@@ IS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months .

the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere , to deliver a mid @-@ year Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired Cal@@ ender for 2017 .

I am doing this for women .
apparently he is the view that the calendar is also doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to representation of tim@@ eless and classical denom@@ ination , at which both women and men feel inspired by these paintings of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will take part in this project because it &apos;s a wonderful art work .

Turkey : short community calcul@@ ates with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan , who is sitting on pack@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish commune of Germany expects short @-@ thousands of protective seek@@ ers to flee from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; a number of a hundred thousand , &quot; believes the For@@ bidden Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the tough operations of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the attempt , the Kurdish congregation of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some hundred thousand gu@@ ards from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight for minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the For@@ bidden Ali Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had been covered during the months of Kurdish Hoch@@ bur@@ gen with criminal ections , 500,000 Kurds are in Turkey on the escape .
after the sever@@ ed coup , there were still se@@ cular and op@@ her@@ al ethnic Turks .
many will begin to start in Europe when they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it may not be that a state that receives refugees have produced refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k .
the association of Staff accused the targeted way of Syrian Arab in Kurdish Arab , but also in al@@ ev@@ ite cities .
so that Earth will increase the transfer pressure to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wiped out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association leader demanded that the federal government set itself &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its tra@@ ilers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; hex@@ en@@ ch@@ id &quot; campaign against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I have no longer been in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
the fire marking as a Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers are destroyed teachers and other university students the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan , who is sitting on pack@@ ers , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation and Education , the &quot; World &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already declared the biggest group of political asylum in Germany before the coup .
on June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all members have been considered to be accepted ( 3@@ 9,@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , the war is not found prior to war , poverty or poverty .
asylum seek@@ ed according to the Basic Law are only political , i.e. by state side , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go , where does it hurt ... &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
by 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament adopted already at the beginning of the year .
since then , it is not possible to get there : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ sw@@ ath@@ y battle - that is fair .
the locals that are convinced of the campaign , are on holiday .
most of the tourists who are in the countryside , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
to do this , practical problems : in the vac@@ ations are hel@@ pers , spread the posters , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yer , and at the end of the vote , to rub it .
up to 4 September 2016 , the election - and last Feri@@ he@@ gy , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern had to pass the election campaign close to the people around the people .
the hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about a thing : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , Leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be feared .
the SPD , since 1998 is the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
it is exciting how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing al@@ D cuts and remains left at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ary .
cel@@ ering , 66 years old and from 2008 governing head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one sees his large pla@@ ster@@ ity .
he travels through the land , distributed ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ sts a little with the people , like it also did his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff &apos;s predecessor .
otherwise , sailors get cold feet , and Chancellor Merkel gives the bl@@ ame on the blos@@ som of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are able to accelerate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ scen@@ sion lists that is expected to cost him as a good office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make a wrong time on the right place campaign .
she has invited the Chancellor Angela Merkel on the German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the northeast . the German Federal Chancellor Angela is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it too bad no man from the other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel listen to it .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U ren@@ ounced the usual elec@@ torate states on market areas and on shopping m@@ alls with umbrel@@ las and air ball@@ ons .
this , so Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union also noted that in the country you have to remove the base , that it must be very strict , to find a wire to the people .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Green Party , hardly available in the times of the country .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ tr@@ ation co@@ ats have also been self @-@ proof : &quot; they must go where there is we@@ h@@ est , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , any birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering gave his SPD now to an especially committed election campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly gained 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , thirst the jump into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern Tu@@ lip and dis@@ close their elec@@ toral campaign against the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it is called the state president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green pol@@ ling stations go on track search for native cases under the holiday homes .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top can@@ ter in , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ bur@@ st lakes and also finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election vacation in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from the blo@@ cking
at the speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to compla@@ in .
for the persons responsible for the construction period , which begin at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning , and only about 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made everything rather delicate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
the construction site was to be transferred to the south of the weekend to the south , until the end of October is scheduled to be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Blessed is the opposite of the persons responsible for the construction period , about if it goes around the establishment of accommodation rides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the lock of the A@@ sper@@ g@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen was lifted up and thereby the connection to Rot@@ ary@@ - has rela@@ xes the traffic situation within the resort .
the citizens can now return to the B 27 by O@@ fan@@ z@@ ingen .
the ref@@ usal to go through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the Princip@@ al @-@ General Management of the rehabilitation of the deputy head of Florian King .
the residents of Bach &apos;s road , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many shots were sought and rather trusted in their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
what resulted in a man@@ ger truck in residential areas .
as the speed limit values were not met , the community demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ s .
&quot; there were significant acquisitions , &quot; says King who made himself on site about the situation .
two to three per minute have already been dra@@ ined .
the quick @-@ speed was reached with 77 hours per hour at the pace of the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , but it became a quiet .
for the business@@ men on the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that is open to customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
the cards do not look like in the cards .
but that the B 27 moderni@@ zation has led to them to grow in sales , everyone who asks you to look back .
however , some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less to do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less to do with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less firms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for anyone has hardly produced the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decrease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local streets are sp@@ elt down along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words .
this is already present @-@ threat@@ ening .
not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; hard . &quot;
it lack@@ ed the customers of He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he insi@@ sted on &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road linking to the street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been thrown back two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has dismissed half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would re@@ acts differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt said on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , otherwise , the restaurant will be able to benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , she must also have the dis@@ advantages that result through the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other rural districts , where you have been more generous .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its host will continue to continue .
finally , the family company has been located here since 17@@ 15 , but it refers to the long history .
so that other regular guests can now understand less frequently due to the complex traffic light , it can understand .
if one can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also different .
that his pedi@@ atri@@ ation is back again after the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with BSE and bir@@ ch , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction works for the biggest crisis which has experienced a restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
understanding will be scre@@ wed in the name of terror attacks on laws .
according to the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a status status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
all his proposals will be rejected by the coalition partner , &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior at the presentation of its new security package .
they want to demand no one .
other , additional points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also have involved me .
but as the Minister of Interior , he was located on results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the coalition .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presented his conclusions for the security in the republic .
but they are falling out therefore all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced that a new security authority shall take care of the cr@@ ate encrypted communication , is not new .
not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements for passenger data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals to date with the SPD : he wants to turn sympath@@ y for terror groups under penalty and hit the jihadists with double citizenship .
&quot; there will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; grants the CD@@ U @-@ man .
he still keep this for reasonable , and demands nothing that I have no opportunities with the coalition partner .
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also .
they partially have it in itself : it is planning quick approach to shifts and more possibilities for the arrest of people before the deportation .
refugees who have been fet@@ ched into the country before their smartphones will quickly be revealed and social media accounts for a security check in advance .
in case of delayed asylum seek@@ ers , he wants some even worse than so far - such as those who commit pen@@ gu@@ ards or throw away their papers to dis@@ close their identity .
some of them is political and legally uncle .
maneu@@ ver has even been un@@ balanced , and can be asked to ask questions .
and in some points - with ine@@ quality treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ led to an example - the question arises : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , it says Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it &apos;s not to talk about that the ass@@ ass@@ esses of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were .
in addition , many people did seem to worry about security in the face of the high refugee .
and things that the people tend to do so , now also in elec@@ toral times are not cl@@ ums@@ y .
the inner security is huge in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nizza .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the protection is large .
and yes , there are elections .
the Union and the SPD will therefore grow increasingly on the subject of inner safety .
in the past few days , it was between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ed dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then backed by a safety policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior , where the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of the double citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also a we@@ aned tones here .
from a return from the double pass he is nothing .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
you new to make , be sensible .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban , he was constitutional law .
whether his own package is constitu@@ ency fixed at all corners , and whether it really is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to show itself .
there is a lot in it , which could make war .
however , the SPD is now attemp@@ ting to pro@@ filed a profile on the subject of internal safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ en@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only once c@@ auti@@ cs and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes further to security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen can still come across .
despite diesel engines , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it is not running in all markets .
at the rear @-@ call , there is a concept for a term .
Volkswagen starts with the delivery deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s largest passenger car can continue to gain a gain in the previous year , despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July weak@@ ened the core brand VW , mainly in Western Europe and re@@ loading the total sales , as shown in Da@@ x listed companies .
the VW &apos;s brand was sold worldwide in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the same period of the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below last year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost a sixth floor .
brand Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann has led the weaker numbers from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , some core markets have been changed by &quot; altered economic conditions &quot; in some core markets .
in addition to the situation around the rab@@ bit attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the outlet of the EU explained a speaker in the EU .
in the USA , where emissions are first es@@ cal@@ ated , it is also a min@@ us to book .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the most affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only an extradition minus of 0.9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
the Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show up a sales plans from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with one software .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW was re@@ iter@@ ated that the conversion of cars have no negative effects .
according to the upgrade of vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance does not have any deteri@@ oration .
the bus station to customers after upgra@@ ding a &quot; guaranteed term &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company &apos;s office .
the reason are legal entities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers now for a guaranteed diesel model . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Justice .
the Ministry of Transport was confirmed that there was a meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has made the recording of my investig@@ ating Commission and the KBA &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the deviations of which will not be accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Justice Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after upgra@@ ding no deteri@@ oration , and all the typ@@ ology relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; but not as it was in company &apos;s offices .
in the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen offers the possibility to upgrade to a workshop half a year after re@@ arm@@ ament about a workshop in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
in the customer interests it is important to avoid that there is no damage to any other damage , which does not have anything to do with the sc@@ andal , as it was called .
therefore , VW is using the term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires the future pen@@ alties in future - as the second institute in Germany .
banking manager Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; There are only around 139 customers , who can park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day money . &quot;
the German Federal Association of German Ban@@ ks speaks of a single case and does not see this signal : normal savings would have to fear &quot; not to be paid for their au@@ ster@@ ity criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
banks money on overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee applies to Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund in September of private and corporate customers for deposits above 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or real money accounts .
&quot; the first 100.000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 costs € 400 in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been offering 40 million euros since the day , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other , and that he could not understand .
&quot; those are with me on the Central Bank account and cause a 0.4 percent cost , &quot; the bank manager said .
&quot; I cannot lay 4000 Euros for each million . &quot;
after the condem@@ nation he will give further the cost of the condem@@ nation .
cash simply in the v@@ ault of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve experienced four accidents , I would not like to see the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank of the Bank .
most clients could have understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the co@@ operative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear to wear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operational permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People - and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger country had made head@@ lines with their ski bank in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , principal managing director of the banking Association , said : &quot; we do not expect that private clients must pay for deposits paid for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff which is somewhat luxuri@@ antly furnished by the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a small bank for a problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are free to preserve money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ lam , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , founded in 1911 .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
currently , there are currently no other banks known to the co@@ operative association of Bavaria , which charge an evaluation rate for deposits of private clients , &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federal Association of German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had said at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , into negatives , is very high , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition was hard , and there dro@@ pping the emig@@ ration of others to the competition .
customers in Germany do not have fallen in the width .
Dest@@ ination plates : who is buying sound panels ?
rich men like middle ages love .
before you to comment on the commentary board , in order to over@@ sow it under the p@@ seud@@ onym Non Al@@ le@@ en@@ sam@@ en@@ men &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the versatile re@@ formation of sound panels is not related to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who wants to welcome new identity of physical objects but due to mid @-@ life @-@ nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record , are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely group of buyers .
it is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional significance : older record runners keep their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow me the camera , while in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest gray suit , before I stand , keep my hands and give something best as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a loser Look on it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly located at its own charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers have been resident - there are still a handful of fantastic table stores .
I would ask the camera thought to turn the camera to the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , I am from S@@ ister Ray ( file number : two young women , three males mean age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of men : eight males , one woman , probably around the 20 ) sequence is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , question me ?
&quot; I guess &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed after my home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records , which he did not afford to buy items , which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are coming from the late 60s , early 70s , which was published when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought to be young in order to buy them , &quot; he says .
he is true that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much .
this is my master .
We@@ z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers who meets he hits the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media group , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and causes to buy their old boards again .
of the discussions that I have led , people usually have sworn in as early as 1998 or 1999 in their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the so @-@ emotional significance of panels ?
it only takes some seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ on@@ ica to recognize that record stores a soo@@ thing community of DC @-@ inn@@ ed .
according to we@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some of the turn@@ tables feel ro@@ wed from the digital world and would like to wrap up the stability of confi@@ denti@@ fied sound plate , of objects , the happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z .
this is with me as a collector , and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; they killed a staff of a turn@@ out stack .
a survey carried out by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who have purchased a record , they still have not heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player who never use it while 7 % of those who buy a record , no turn@@ tables .
at that time of the news report , I would probably look very wor@@ ried , while I went through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pil@@ es .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at So@@ unds of the Universe ( number of men : three men middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; trophy aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ ca .
&quot; someone happened recently here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a record player but I would like to buy a radio head record , that I would like to put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a large percentage , but it will definitely happen .
more product , less tac@@ it .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who come first slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound boards almost a whole floor , has an underground audience than I go clean .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos make teen@@ ager and women mean age .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest synth@@ es@@ izers and expert pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ills from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity in customers .
none of them can be sol@@ itary confin@@ ed , but fixed psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a very difficult if one stands for 30 seconds next to someone .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the business for a few minutes , and viewed the Vari@@ et@@ tos for selling plates .
it looks more a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ake than a big one .
it doesn &apos;t deser@@ ve a lot , therefore , the collecting of records is not a real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a loving epidemic .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business which is said that a new generation of record @-@ lovers will be inspired : urban Out@@ scra@@ p .
while I give the ticket , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager , I observe a group of young teenage cameras , who are group@@ ed for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter superior to buy a Cro@@ ley disk player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential boards for an average collection .
nobody can see her - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to deal them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but in view of that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compla@@ in .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most for luxury objects like boards .
even if my research asked that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they give at least in record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female colle@@ cti@@ bles , that exist in reality , record shops and on@@ line@@ work .
these people work hard to work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the B@@ um@@ ble by record stores of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while at the rigid view of an un@@ born , 30 @-@ year @-@ old Moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders of the middle ages .

French court re@@ jects an offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
in case of negoti@@ ation this week , the authorities went to Cal@@ ais that the state should sell , 72 temporary shops , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser services , or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euro in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais ar@@ gued that these places should be torn down , because they would be paid a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid , and the local risk of fire .
humanitarian groups distributed to the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that supported by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 Pro@@ visional shops , but there was a fact that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; is absolutely retro@@ fitt@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes , and restaurants can play a much bigger role than just people living in extreme pre@@ ferences . &quot;
he said that the areas of calm plans offer between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the young Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which is meant to be profitable after 200 meals a day , English and French classes and advice to asylum , for hundreds of protection needy , un@@ accompanied minor age in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to get the Kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it is said that the closing time &quot; for the children of a cat@@ astrophe would be , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
the two aid organisations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge had risen on Friday that the number of living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers in the course of summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation command line : in different federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flashes are tested , which should be very effective .
the Fut@@ ur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used on accidents , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to san@@ e bridges with temporary Tem@@ se , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit@@ ing with a stationary bl@@ ers .
a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or complex .

great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ star Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold gets
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ d Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ um Stadium in Rio .
Fiji divided a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , After@@ ward , liner cross and ro@@ wers to win gold - their first Olympic da@@ zz@@ ling each color .
the defeat of the silver medal was won by the not too bad trophy - Great Britain - and they could absolutely be proud of their efforts in that tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the significant defeat of the Bo@@ dies , 7 @-@ 5 in semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall on them in the final .
however , in this form , a 15 @-@ man team was defeated in its form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB , but it is likely not that at least one bridge will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind him .
eight years ago , she lost each game at the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one thing .
this cap is hurt , but the progress is amazing .
the Fiji began a lot and made the GB@@ S attacks from Sp@@ ass .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , as if one would run into the buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au entered the corner .
at another four minutes , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB are almost taken to the ball .
a he@@ avi@@ or t@@ ame of Mitchell stops the mountain of Man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but it did not stop .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa van@@ ish in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival , and there were still more than one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou breath@@ ed through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion had a 29 @-@ 0 to break .
it is so when Fiji that was born to play 7 , while UK still picked up .
it is that way too .
GB led basic changes to semi @-@ time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for every four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time until Joshua ran Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilli@@ ants of Fiji .
Dan Norton started a test for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went already long in favor of the southern sulph@@ ur , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vil@@ i@@ ame set the i bag cap with another attempt in the last seconds .
the man @-@ cor@@ ted , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB k@@ ick@@ ally destroyed in the lawn .
earlier on the day I defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Britain pressed South Africa into a tight semi@@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant in@@ late Tac@@ kling Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the English 15 key teams , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fight with the cancer of the train@@ ers inspired by the trainer of the trainer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be no more potential gold than these games , and that will be called something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the first rowing boat to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting by the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present at the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the dou@@ bling without tax nurse in succession , the first women in the history of the British Sports , which laid a scale in such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all of her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ le@@ aking use , which is also exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant Athlet@@ es , which led over the surface with the elegance of weak@@ nesses , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ umph@@ al .
behind every gold in the ruin you can contribute to the content of the batt@@ al@@ ion who make the difference and there was no thought of sense than the trainer , who didn &apos;t know this day , whether he was diagnosed with cancer than it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky something .
I had bla@@ dder cancer , which did it and they did so .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment beginning in early 2014 , outside the season , which could begin the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that under such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , therefore it had to go back soon .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
so it begins .
the rowing is a challenge , but that makes it a major challenge .
in the in@@ fertil@@ ity of the victory they went their first thoughts on Williams , who spent some more than otherwise , and thus trying to handle his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was the captain of the Royal Art@@ illery in one deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a emotional wreck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means much . &quot;
it &apos;s repeatedly , how much that I mean , how much I and Helen and I have worked Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive Dan@@ ke is on him . he is the best trainer of the world .
I would have no better person to exercising or wish to wish a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot to reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , keep in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make a little Tol@@ les .
we wanted to have no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a break for one year before making decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV adventure of your Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that could have been too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes here .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years exempl@@ ary for clarity of clarity
the manager of the water @-@ purpose &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , goes into retirement .

Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ one praised Aquari@@ us Al@@ f@@ ons Greek , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water tank and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his view , he designated the well @-@ structure and the re@@ structure of the purpose .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the tube of the floo@@ ding at the feast on a 3rd of January .
we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the power supply of Neu@@ brunn was once more exciting , because one filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with gravel stones .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who follow up the successor to Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s journey .

steel - Light view for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains sp@@ ared by additional costs at millions .
the financial burden , which the industry threatened by the Ö@@ r@@ rom promotion , are from the table .
it remains at the liberation of Renewable Energy Efficiency in the German Steel Industries , said Federal Minister for Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Newspap@@ er &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
according to the European Commission , initially planned , the steel producer , the gases coming from the high @-@ furnace of power supply for their own consumption , to ask for cash .
according to the German industry industry , the steel industry threatened additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic principles with the EU Commission after talks with competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators be replaced in the steel works , an EEG conversion of 20 percent will be reduced .
but also these will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for its own production .
thus , the status qu@@ o of the current regulation will be written largely .
special importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; further need to follow &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with the reform of the emissions just@@ ification for climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hofmann declared in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis of 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to spread , as the world &apos;s largest producers in China sur@@ rendered to the world market in view of the world market .
European Manufac@@ turer t@@ oss Chinese steel concer@@ tos price d@@ umping .
during this spring of spring the situation slightly relaxed .
for one point , mer@@ cen@@ aries on import steel effect , to others the economic prospects in China have stopped .
it is un@@ clear how long the price @-@ up is needed .
the German industry pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ously on Thursday .
most recently the prices had more stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult position with additional cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to un@@ lock all individual works for the last time .
at the end of 2015 around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel manufacturer remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
produced by 3.4 million tonnes , they produced at least six percent less crude steel than in the same period of the previous year , as the steel unification of steel in Friday .
after a short increase in May the produced amount was then returned to the second consecutive month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been increased by two percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
the association expects to increase sales in the coming months thanks to an increase in order situation .
fellowship , Spirit , health : do seniors good
the singing , Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the course of studies she finished music and today she sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a pension@@ er choir .
&quot; singing moves - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes it .
after a rehear@@ sal it feels complete , mer@@ r@@ ily and a total of living , says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way , they do something good for their health and their spirit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because S@@ ingen is like a great hob@@ by for seniors , who says Erhard Hac@@ kler from the German senior liga .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of the music , he describes Hac@@ kler .
by regular compositions , seniors can do and maintain social contacts .
for often social and familiar structures occur at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to arrange and to organize themselves on the others - a choir is a very special form of &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can sing in the positive sense , Hac@@ kler feels .
because the pension@@ ers train a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever requires his lung regularly , is not so fast out of the pu@@ rest .
even though it &apos;s about to get the sound of the voice at age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hob@@ by .
in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Association of Emplo@@ ye@@ es @-@ organizations .
in the older generations , the shared bathroom had a much higher positions , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and free time .
L@@ enz observed often that the singing or listening of songs by older people are che@@ er@@ ful , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
lyrics and especially chan@@ ted tunes themselves de@@ men@@ tions people in a long @-@ lasting events .
in the case of singing , a special performance is required , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a huge cogn@@ itive challenge .
even older people who live alone , do not only practi@@ cing themselves on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that leads to us by the singing in the choir , says Hac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is also growing by the singing in the choir .
even to show yourself : when I feel long for something , I will get better and awake beyond me - these experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to begin with the singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try out a new hob@@ by , should not hesitate - even if it doesn &apos;t hesitate to have little talent .
you do not sing alone - for 50 sin@@ ful people who hears , when a sound goes next to it ?
looking for the appropriate offer , seniors have different possibilities , says Hac@@ kler .
if anyone sings from a friend circle in an older par@@ ench@@ ant@@ or , one can easily connect .
many cities offer over@@ views over the choirs in the area .
who like to sing in a church choir can be moved directly to the church or the church leader .
many seniors choirs can also be found via the internet .
if anyone has no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask help with the Internet .
whoever has to sing has to sing , should necessarily connect a choir , av@@ enger from Hac@@ kler .
singing the soul good , and has something to sing - this applies to every age .
cats react more sensitive than cat to carp@@ enter the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the ruins of cat baby has grown up to adult animals .
as a surprise , the male didn &apos;t look cold , however , however , they stopped the difference to the female always .
female cats may detect the relief rates of Kat@@ cat bab@@ ys on the yo@@ ung@@ sters of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , which is found in great distress such as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
males react to the ruins of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mixed lot of less and strongly ar@@ er@@ ts are not perc@@ ep@@ tible for the males either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ ra@@ ke Conf@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is first authorized in the study that was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cl@@ ie with the Dr@@ ing@@ ability of their help needs .
in total , nine adult K@@ ater and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the veter@@ in@@ let of the MH@@ H .
they were played for little ones who were played for three minutes from the throw @-@ box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
at the other hand they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ am from stronger , k@@ itt@@ ens , which were also raised in addition .
researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for sa@@ wing power@@ fully .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring re@@ acted to the carp@@ ie , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned fast to the speaker when the ruin of the very exhau@@ sting k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be born or develop into sex with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby noise in the past .
also some studies showed that women re@@ affir@@ med their infants , regardless of whether they were mothers , or not reported the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .

this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the demonstration .
it is not made prior to football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ ick@@ ers Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r , the Public Prosecutor put an arrest warrant .

bomb error in Thailand - Austrian injured - multiple deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is standing in contact with the woman , the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas St@@ öl@@ l , Friday night .
they had taken care in the hospital , and had been treated with the hospital , but have already left them back .
she planned her home journey at the beginning of September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Phu@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on , also an Austrian citizen , are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs takes on this regard to a permanent contact with the local authorities , as s@@ öl@@ l .
in the approximately 200 kilometers south of the capital city of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in an out@@ going quarter of two bombs .
according to the police , the police have been killed and killed about 20 people including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Ital@@ ians .
once again , two explo@@ sions went up again , and another human being killed , according to the authorities .
in the morning , Phu@@ ket was also reported a bomb explosion .
in the det@@ onation near the popular Ba@@ un@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , the det@@ onation was injured as a taxi driver according to police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal staff .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives , went into the air , according to the authorities in a flower bed before the prec@@ inct .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as Ch@@ ann@@ on on the south @-@ east coast , there are several clubs .
one was taken in connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; the bomb ent@@ ate bear the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; army General Dan@@ ai Criti@@ cism , Friday early journalists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are leaving that there are a coordinated attack . &quot;
it is too early to sell themselves to possible motives - probably the action of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern by the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of a Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , on the other hand , the Thai police stated that the attacks did not constitute in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement movement , or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is estimated that the bombs were put out of the opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities would have been informed of the upcoming attacks in the South of the country in recent days - but they were not informed about the exact time and the locations .
still be un@@ clear , what a group behind the attacks .
the police pointed their civil servants throughout the country to strengthen safety around the important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and leisure areas .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ bers again , but they are usually not directed against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the mind bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is advis@@ able to make the instructions of Thai safety authorities .
high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah Vi@@ et and its surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will not be necessary to do the necessary trips in these provinces .
increased security risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday spent a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution of the military j@@ unta .
this grants to the military big influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta @-@ Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that the bombs had been an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country moved towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , continues to keep the kingdom of stability and order again .
however , the military does not have managed to get the military rebels in the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago in Bangkok , Bangkok had been killed in an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ pure 20 people - most of them are foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ od@@ est attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is listed in the visor of the Federal Office of Constitutional Court .
after several nation@@ alities , the Constitutional Court also commissioned the group of Ob@@ servation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; Get@@ ting points for regulatory democratic rights , &quot; said the constitutional law Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
such are the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East in most extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we observe the movement now .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns out against &quot; Mul@@ g@@ ult@@ i W@@ ahn , &quot; un@@ controlled mass emig@@ ration &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity . &quot;
the Constitutional Court of nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - watch the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not eat his authority in the decision of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick their target group since it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional head said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are generally trying to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an exhau@@ sti@@ ble advertisement for its own thing .
the prop@@ aganda is supposed to be emotional .
young people are due to a special way .
that is dangerous .
at the last time it was given from several Länder reports about contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; to Af@@ D politi@@ cian .
Ma@@ ate said he had no findings .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point .
it is coming to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , the most extrem@@ ist , changes its target direction and most of the most extrem@@ ist .
therefore , therefore , whether such people ste@@ er the influence on the party .
this is not apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the clear increase of human rights and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee income , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we &apos;ve found in the past few years that it can just@@ ify the legitim@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be quite true that further just@@ ify groups or small groups , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , are planning against refugee families or attacks from other right @-@ wing motifs .
but a Germany &apos;s wide or pan @-@ wide control of rec@@ ster@@ ism is not recogn@@ is@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
wor@@ ried about the fact , they did not ate that many attacks went on the account of people who had not entered the scene in advance .
that is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the tat@@ too attacks with attacks on asylum charges are not known as crimin@@ als , political motiv@@ ating offen@@ ders or tra@@ ilers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many persons have committed criminal complaints before having right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or for instance CD@@ U , SPD or left , however , have to be ra@@ dic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extre@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this shows the bra@@ ve appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight flo@@ ats from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his pre@@ run with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place .
but it was rather not the sporting figure that attracted the attention of international media .
but why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians received a special start@@ up from the international swimming pool .
it is distributed to make swimming in the present countries of well @-@ known countries .
as in e@@ th@@ op@@ ia most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its makes ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ name arose quickly .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
the English tab@@ lo@@ id blatt &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny as well .
his time , he only smote with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle , played there any role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was used for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool of Equ@@ ator@@ ial @-@ Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre@@ run over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle alone .
fr@@ en@@ etically was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before the Olympia , and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the G@@ f@@ K @-@ lace since 2011 .

cr@@ ashes - Bus non@@ slip in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ opol@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight Ver@@ sions
in an accident involving a travel agency of 43 senior citizens , there were eight people injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ opol@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , the police divided .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old chassis of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to pass to their information , according to the opposite direction of a way that drove off part in the opposite way .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a speaker in the Aur@@ I / Witt@@ mund police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the passengers .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ances came to the accident at the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the remaining travelers were brought back to Kr@@ um@@ m@@ opol@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ ood by a liner bus .
there you should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and possible witnesses to sign up in the police .
the fees per cubic meters of se@@ wage are from 1 October 2016 for the range of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3,@@ 44 Euro instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
in an Az@@ endorf plant , the se@@ wer@@ age fee will be higher than once again , if appropriate measures will need to be necessary .
after a lasting calculation , the se@@ wage price will be at Az@@ endorf at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the manager of the budget was determined by the Council of the Land@@ rat and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that they are running out for se@@ wage plants .
due to the legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate in charge of the facilities .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ ason , Az@@ endorf , L@@ ame , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ berg , will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se .
the containers are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of Herbert Schmidt &apos;s Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt was necessary to re @-@ stim@@ ulate the fees for the se@@ wage plants of the market community .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , excess or sub @-@ cover@@ ings from the previous se@@ cul@@ ation period are likely to be compens@@ ated .
the engraved structure established Schmidt thus established itself with all three se@@ wage plants around relatively small facilities with a very low san@@ itation , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be gra@@ vely operational .
in addition , the se@@ wage flow in all three systems is slightly decreasing .
furthermore , in the past ten@@ ancy period of all three systems , not least because of its age &apos;s age and repair expenses in a considerable volume .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
in the meantime , Schmidt showed that Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage due to damage .
in the pump of which the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first cl@@ erg@@ ometers had to be turned into operation after almost 20 years , the se@@ minal plasma ensures and an additional ventilation can also be installed in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; this extraordinary expenses came into account for this extraordinary expenses , which are considered to be taken into account in the new cal@@ cul@@ ation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that at the low age of water in the three plants , expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
in this case , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs were sp@@ ared over the last 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to remain stable after view of stone houses , especially since you could not extend the supply area of the se@@ wage industry in the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal region around this facilities , because it is about de@@ struc@@ tur@@ ary facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian cartoon criti@@ ci@@ zed
Snap@@ chat tells you that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive against races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that already borders the absur@@ d .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are distinctive , in@@ trin@@ sic tools that generate more than 30 million improved selenium per day .
all the flaws were to be opened to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have been drawn in the past criti@@ que , in which they accused the app Black@@ face @-@ front or white skin as a beauty deal .
when this week , some U@@ sers proposed a filter , which gave them dark teeth , false teeth and dar@@ ker che@@ eks , some critics called a ra@@ dic@@ tive car@@ ic@@ ec@@ ologist of Asia - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot;
they asked whether they repeated their repeated contro@@ vers@@ y on a larger issue , that the company has di@@ vers@@ y .
the news and the indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat that it would have been disabled .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as the car@@ ic@@ ycle of Asia .
but external standing , the R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us experienced , remin@@ ded the filter of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
other expenses decided to draw the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an e @-@ mail we wrote Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student whose twe@@ aking have been widespread throughout the photographs that the filter &quot; viol@@ ently and it was said to be un@@ pleasant . &quot;
it added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the return of a very conflic@@ ting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter has not been par@@ tri@@ umph@@ ed , but that the yel@@ low@@ ness was withdrawn into the extreme extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that has crossed the cultural tunnels .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless seal and integration of integ@@ ers , of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience for young people - who are different in the breed of a lot more than their older opponents - could expect rather to anticip@@ ate Sen@@ si@@ veness .
if one has produced a picture of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters , &quot; so it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided that he works as a product manager and engineer for media , to delete their Snap@@ chat account and put others to do the same .
in a set of media and in a telephone interview they said that they believe that r@@ ass@@ essing contro@@ vers@@ y reflect a lack of gas@@ ket with Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part of white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ il@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; I either have no different representation of people with other skin colors , so that they can meet people with other skin colors that work there , but not in locations where they are safe or comfortable to tell what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint which Snap@@ chat has not been left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any figures for the di@@ vers@@ ation of its employees and points to its status as private companies .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a speaker has recently set a staff responsible , which focuses on sub@@ re@@ presented population groups and on internal integrity .
Z@@ hu said that she will leave their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership - IS@@ IS secret information , set up the Committee of Congress
as part of the United States Central Command , the United States Central Command changed news information to draw a optimi@@ stic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it permits the actual states of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the dispute , intelligence services and the military budget , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence , reported such as anticip@@ ates its obj@@ ection to the American state struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news service information , typically used by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , recorded regularly a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism , when it could have allowed the actual states on site , and were cited as analysis of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened in Cent@@ Com is in@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses of our political leaders , &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , firm .
the guide errors in Cent@@ Com is up to the top point of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct information on it , the government pointed out under Obama statements , shows how analysts saw the pressure from their pre@@ laws , a optimi@@ stic image from the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ sil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command releases , opinions and statements of the Congress were clearly positive when it corresponds to the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin already in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , this is much clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command ( Central Command ) changed the following reports to record the threat by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in the Life , after giving them the fact that analy@@ st make some concerns about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will be continued during the investigations .
additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway in addition to the general inspec@@ torate of the Ministry of Defense .
the democratic members of the news service committee published their own findings , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force in some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com adopted a revised trial for the creation of in@@ corporate ass@@ ess@@ ments to I@@ sil and the Iraqi security services , a member of Adam B. ship , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
this process , as Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the publication of publication according to reports , &quot; the mur@@ al under the analysts and &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. ship and Democrats gave no evidence on an input of the White House near Cent@@ Com analysts in terms of a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; .
last August , the New York Times reported investigation of the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tions that were enrolled according to complaints of Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press meeting of the Pentagon in a position to comment on that the Ministry of Defence would not be informed of the congress , while the investigations of the General inspec@@ torate would be in progress .
but he also gave the fact that &quot; experts sometimes have quite for@@ ged opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of the national defence . &quot;
the investigations have gone out over the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the debt of debt of the past year , however , did the question President Obama to Central Command the military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criti@@ que concerning the secret information on the Islamic State remin@@ ders over ten years ago , as an Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ kers , a font in Iraq , considering the recommendations of many analysts , had a little time to shed about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ kers also played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team introduced to Mr. Hoo@@ kers according to information of government agencies , that , contrary to the statements of the government , refin@@ eries had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this provisional refin@@ eries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times was reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s was appointed commander @-@ in Chief Apostle Lloyd J. Austin III , by members of the legisl@@ atures due to his exc@@ essive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced in Central Command through Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , show@@ down a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also won the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games were actually a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) told it not to remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equivalent to the British in their first place , who remained unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will run on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams quali@@ fies for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams compete in the first and second place within its group from six teams .
the first plat@@ ter will take a little longer a little longer from the road that lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprisingly host of her success story , four years after they landed in the past London Games at the last of 12 locations .
B@@ am was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey ra@@ cket in hands ( their two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national game of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , as they did not qualify for the cad@@ mium .
then came the year 2012 , where her team went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we had not the work of work in London , which we now have .
we have completely moved the ruin completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a return of the s@@ uture .
India was without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed surprisingly durable and held the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until the game took into their hands .
she carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ sted the ball into the gate for a 2 @-@ 0 tour .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the Tor@@ ski@@ er of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to now have to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday .
among the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and un@@ riv@@ alled , a rapid @-@ growing seasons between competition and Stre@@ ets .
it is when the olymp@@ ic fi@@ bro@@ el itself would be a burning staff that leaves from the bracelet for s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queu@@ e in the Coff@@ es@@ hop , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ y@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a girl with a dimples , could quite well be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ known TV advertisement if he would have a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner , or even Fe@@ eder .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , figh@@ ts in the olymp@@ ic tr@@ amp around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade there are sports species that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shoot , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always swim the chest , and may rule it long .
but if I should make a modest arguments for my particular lovers , then let me feel the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tr@@ amp .
although the tr@@ amp has already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years , it was perceived that many who had asked , didn &apos;t know that it &apos;s ever a Olympics portal .
this could also be the regional Ign@@ or@@ ance .
although the US athletes sent to the competition , there has never won a medal in the tr@@ amp @-@ jump and had been a athl@@ ete until 2012 , which had managed to get up until the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the men and the Chinese , and the Canadian who share their wives .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tr@@ amp @-@ jump has a certain external se@@ clu@@ e , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear pass@@ able for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as they sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am no expert , but only a true enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous cit@@ ations of his never to end , but also the gra@@ zie of the turn@@ around and diving that combines two sports , which are basically united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much means &quot; diving board . &quot;
the winner will jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must land a number of falling movements ( turning , boo@@ bs and sal@@ tos ) before being landing on the feet .
you will be judged according to official Olympic ap@@ ro@@ ogram after execution , difficulty and flight time . &quot;
two @-@ per@@ enni@@ al athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are competing in Rio against each other .
the common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , to top and beyond , sometimes up to the target , sometimes , and back , up to the playground and down the playground .
you are not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV transmission also another goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the targeted stre@@ ak is no@@ bel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a viewer in tears .
but it &apos;s also what I think of looking for this games as a bit tired .
this trampoline offers an At@@ emp@@ orium .
the v@@ ector of tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or her pr@@ un@@ es , seem@@ ingly heavier than an astron@@ aut , go down to the top , then effort@@ lessly back to the top .
also here is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the destination , no mer@@ cen@@ aries into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant setting from time and heavy force .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only .
the qualifying and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the En@@ dr@@ ons as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
amid@@ st the Olympia Man@@ ie , they speak a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably over@@ see in general tum@@ ult .
when the productivity of consciousness can only be achieved by the case of anxi@@ ety and the object of the male US Turner , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its following air , a new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long One ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demand political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gled for violent opposition to the government .
witnesses say that eighty @-@ prot@@ esters were killed during mer@@ ging with the police at Sch@@ uss@@ ani .
is Ethiopia just collapsed ?
over the past ten years , there was one of the most stable countries in Africa , one of the majority of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government shook the country and far more areas .
last week , thousands of people were stor@@ med on the streets and the fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the answer of the government was un@@ merciful .
witnesses showed that polic@@ emen were shot down un@@ armed and killed by polic@@ emen .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , will show how sensitive people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights Reser@@ ves an incoming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country and in future it will even be more difficult , &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the manager of the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services are working closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , in particular in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western aid .
the Ethiop@@ ian economy exp@@ ands its remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pel@@ ines in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy , human rights organisations continuously ongoing the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited , and dis@@ sidents were brought to silence .
many were sent into exile , or put into prison , or put them in the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ ek Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from the ground up to saus@@ ages in relation to power of the governing coalition .
following a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , the tensions descend along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a battle for these ra@@ ging , disputed line demanded in June hundreds of lives .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were forced to re@@ use more or less during the last years .
several factors explain why emotions had been explo@@ de under the surface after many years ago , or explo@@ de the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , because cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially with protests , so many people can communicate over internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide , where they keep up .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave heed that they were gathered together to protest .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ as in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
since the year , the Am@@ har@@ a prosp@@ ering mainly Christian high @-@ lands , in politics and economy , while they carried out the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests found in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos saw that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ers , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population , which are dominant in the military , in the intelligence and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leaders , had until his death on a non @-@ public disease in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of the corners .
the analysts say that it was especially discussed in fact , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction , and to use special officers to edit enemies and to make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st said it , is missing . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who arrived from the tiger of the North Sea region of North America , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
the analy@@ st say that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many believed that the result will be more blood shed .
the last time , Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ing , according to analysis of analysts , seem@@ ingly stolen from the government and then stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many Protest@@ ants were killed , even though it were less than in the last months and that time of dist@@ urban@@ ces declined relatively fast .
development experts praised the Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new pel@@ ines , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in the poverty level .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal Miss@@ y of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and they take a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month of protest in gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ian city , run by Tig@@ ers , and the hatred toward the tiger is more common in the social media .
the analy@@ st say that protests and other Western allies have put into a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even though it has recently shared that this base has closed .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to merge his bund@@ led in an already vol@@ at@@ ile neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin walking migration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama created IS@@ IS , &quot; sar@@ cas@@ us . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y by taking his campaign that his several repe@@ ating his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State of Islamic State , not serious .
this clarity the new questions on the communication duties of the Repub@@ lic@@ as of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate in the public and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his fellow @-@ stre@@ ak who endeav@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the actual position that he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having made a constitu@@ ent event on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had taken back on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really didn &apos;t intend to interpret that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in a early morning interview on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is simple , neu@@ tered .
in contrast to the previous day , in which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the exc@@ use perfect .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help something that he wants to destroy it , remin@@ ded that Mr. Obama &apos;s IS@@ IS wanted to destroy nothing of it at the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate .
the final storm of criticism is coming down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct his campaign to direct the economic situation on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this topic .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bor@@ ing bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ cas@@ us to his defense .
at the end of July , he moved to himself a criti@@ que when he thought about the Russians should be Mrs. Clin@@ t E@@ mails , but later he said , &quot; Nat@@ ür@@ lich said the coff@@ in . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to recru@@ itment .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages received from his fans as they arrive , and then , &quot; clear &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication of communication , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I think it is cle@@ ver enough to keep his testimonies v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even kit@@ ten with its sound , since its circul@@ ate values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was published on Friday , showed a lead with a large margin in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ant statements , he is accused of understanding his critics and to understand his testimonies or hum@@ our .
but while he is focusing on the attention of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps sch@@ er@@ ze have brought his lo@@ y@@ oral mit@@ ig@@ ite into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant can also be his testimonies .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent inter@@ speaking , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he was questioned about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton have founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is in this sense true that Obama &apos;s IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it hin@@ ders , completely wrong , and so it happened , because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most mainst@@ re@@ am Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government was responsible for Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton allowed as Secretary of State , IS@@ IS allowed themselves to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
in front of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump put his attacks on the media and threw them before , on each of his words , and def@@ aults to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cannot ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats responded to Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Ent@@ ities than just a further evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .
once more on the price of the market , café comes back to Green@@ point
ver@@ b Cafe was a certified café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which you could only pay for free Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices of course displaced from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the business of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , opened in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals divided it as last loss in a gen@@ etically modified city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ o wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that the German Civil Code is dead , the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York Change is change , it is also new .
a recur@@ rent Ver@@ b cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and similar to a simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ standing employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafés .
he began to work in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer has offered an order to provide money for a new outside unit , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept many things .
ver@@ b the same distributor for excav@@ ators bought the same Esp@@ res@@ cal machinery model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and auti@@ ated onions .
there is natural cream keys .
the café offers no beer more , but there are fresh sa@@ ws .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noted a st@@ amped electricity to old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also overcome by the rates of Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after you moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way back .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave a while for the coff@@ in , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that it was in the coffee and the culture of the Ver@@ b , which was pleased to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered using a bl@@ ended ch@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ term and faithful customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered un@@ question@@ ably in existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and receive new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he didn &apos;t he@@ a G@@ roll about that the soap business has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to produce a special soap for di@@ b with the ch@@ ill coffee of the coffee as an ingre@@ dient .
&quot; I think we will still go down on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he would soon prove it , so that his new neighbors feel very welcome .
the site also has additional advantages .
a local juice locally would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café exp@@ ands on a neighboring building .
a new ver@@ b is sufficient for many customers to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was gene@@ alog@@ y and said that he was destroyed by the floor as the café closed .
when the new café opened , he said that the location of the Lok@@ er and the best coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the sm@@ ells , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; an adequate meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch in O@@ val Office .
President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ thful for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland ra@@ f@@ ond soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pure@@ e and as dessert a P@@ fl@@ au@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering men , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e , added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was published by the Chinese kitchen in the USA , while brick in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , as they meet together with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop , a small , schn@@ au@@ c@@ asserole in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash of 1929 .

when the repor@@ ter was turned out , the couple found the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingre@@ dient and some budget which the ingre@@ dient .

&quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ AT buffet .
teams of women co@@ ined for male rock and it was freshly baked past@@ ed to breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans , who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the roads with which the country went with it , no longer the lar@@ s@@ country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in eating for the Americans , a centr@@ alized theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ ted co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
likewise , the new budget has been e@@ ager@@ ly awa@@ ited : mysterious food such as unleavened bread and c@@ asserole no@@ d@@ ules were repeated as &quot; wonderful art , eating remains re@@ pres@@ sive , because the qui@@ che in@@ appet@@ ite ingredients could be stored under a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry ob@@ st .
meat , which was the heart of American kitchen , was too rare for a rare luxury .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally unique mixtures were tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and severe contamination were made before taste or even healthy food .
during their research for the book which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no more popular addition to the lunch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onion does not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since then , Louise Stanley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating hab@@ its of the country are alike alike .
having published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , she encour@@ aging women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ing inside &quot; and to transform the challenge , pic@@ kled like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with carrots in delicious meals , just to be justified .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical treat .
in particular , reports are subject to the answer of the government to star@@ ving citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Me@@ at .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm@@ houses of its kitchen , it vom@@ it as the million@@ th major man from the world to whom he has become .
&quot; he liked a continental kitchen such as fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; says Co@@ e .
he ate in a well @-@ g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and made a Smo@@ king .
it was wonderful to be realistic .
President Roosevelt would have committed the same error , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the an@@ thro@@ es of a manager with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt , that the White House brought the bor@@ ing great food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected when the country came back onto the legs again .
this continued focus on calories and food on our continuing focus on calories and food , as well as science was applied to food@@ stuffs .
the pair was better understood at the writing of the book in law in law in law in law in law - for example they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; says Co@@ e .

after the plates were cleared by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the P@@ fl@@ au@@ man , who ate President Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that it was a usual tri@@ ck , modest recipes can be missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .

he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a Fass@@ ak@@ y @-@ attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the White Hel@@ mets , a civilian control group that saved the lives of almost 60,000 people according to the picture newspaper .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to move people from the bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civil society that shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a nurs@@ ing from the tru@@ sts of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians for bright symbols in the dit@@ ory of the war .
but as heroes he has never seen himself , according to the image : &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter has cast four façade bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlor@@ o@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb , so that children &apos;s not play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Greenland : the oldest sp@@ ine is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland will usually come on the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return on board the S@@ anna &apos;s research on board .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swimming with a speed of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland is only available with 150 years of offspring .
at the bottom of the Greenland expedition at the bottom of the North Atlantic , an hour occurs in an average of 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes on , it accelerates the five meter long animal at a speed of 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is nearly as fast as a Rob@@ be .
but this one of long lon@@ el@@ iness lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen is Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in the case of an Greenland expedition , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness &quot; commented on the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock these life span , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
indeed , the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist assumed that Greenland will become a stone .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland they are difficult to observe , after all they live in the ice @-@ sea front of the coastal waters of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive in the surface only in winter .
researchers have to know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
her time @-@ bends , they seem to carry six animals with a transmitter in front of val@@ bard .
lo@@ ot make these shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young ic@@ ir@@ ate .
possibly ch@@ ase them sleep sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for k@@ da@@ vers that are removed from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard around the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 cm measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the linear core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens was formed already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which are contained in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the liner core .
their birth was therefore supposed to be after the early 1960s , when atomic weapons try out larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
in the 220 centimeters of length of the smallest @-@ smallest animal contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear arm , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
in their liner core , all major Greenland groups had a normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities that arises due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock was shown for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metre @-@ long Greenland at the age of 335 while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centimeters is even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , known .
now the researchers of the length could be re@@ arranged .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters can be reached on the threshold of the sexually mature , and at the age of 156 , Greenland with the absence of at least one and a half centuries .
also this should be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
there is no co@@ incidence that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ es live in icy waters , especially in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland expedition , put on the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught on Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the organism living there live animals on spar@@ rows .
so they mature later - and al@@ ise slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
the volume is growing much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than in one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives in dangerous and should be focused on it as soon as many offspring as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a very big animal was supposed to invest in a long life rather than a long life .

Frankfurt benef@@ ited from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of the Main Event in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg has the best chances to move from London engaged jobs and firms .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most of the Bre@@ x@@ ite vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain that cash houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions in the EU .
the approval is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU Pass to them in Great Britain .
they just use great US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to store jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ ist &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision via the largest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as further important authorities such as European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and Risk Management ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have established its headquarters , but this is for the financial sector less important than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close to the emergency bank is important for banks , as it can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ut@@ ch@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg , there will be a large fund sector , cutting edges as well as Dublin at the infrastructure .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
further points the city with slightly available business property .
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries .
in addition , the bank rentals will also be 50 percent higher than in the Main Event .
in Frankfurt , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life as the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of business consult@@ ancy Mer@@ cer stand up the city on No. seven , Luxemburg at No. 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even if life quality is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; consequently , the I@@ W .
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s vote , the most important financial centre in Europe will remain in Europe , my economic for@@ ger .
therefore , there are also relations conditions : in London according to figures of the Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it were 6@@ 2500 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ folds a media watch , after having betrayed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ fix in Berlin since the Kemp@@ inski Hotel had requested a staff in Berlin according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ lip documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; published his doctors in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by taking an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed in the countries that can be ordered directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel eliminated and deleted ?
the Lanz@@ mann wrote .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel via an own Call Center .
after a statement , the director returned to the hotel reception .
the answer , which he got there , &quot; shot him , &quot; how Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel had said that the measure would be a &quot; clear decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason , which stood behind , resol@@ ute more rage in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election will be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann has been cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das Mer@@ man called this &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed from this event .
that is really very pol@@ em@@ ing .
the fact that this chain has been worn in Germany in precisely this hotel chain , is even bigger shame .
no explanation requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect that the hotel has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident demonstrated a rather big reson@@ ance on the Internet , where the people called for a sc@@ andal .
some under@@ stands the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there would have been the alleged collection of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she called it in another contribution in which the hotel was pointed out that the hotel is located on the noble cur@@ ator , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all charges of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to the incident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; The Mir@@ ror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to record Israel into the quick voting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German newspaper had a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
with the repe@@ al of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran could be equal to 7@@ 0.9 per cent .
since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest on pages of Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , divided the ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further merchant construction is one of the largest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan .
he understood that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 grew by 7@@ 0.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million compared to the same period in 2015 .
in particular , Russian imports climbed by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade start was achieved by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes back to a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
last year , the rus@@ sian foreign citizen of around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which affects the tourist places in Russia .
it could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists will be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians have visited Iran , some from whom the ambassador is hoping to change it .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit to Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to receive the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ med in home than Br@@ ite gold for wheel sport
Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ste last night in the event of the male team in the event of the event in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor of his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made a legend . he pointed out the legend , when he stor@@ med his house , to get a win from favorites New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
she repeated the trick after they took place in March at the World Championships in London despite the recall of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the substitute for Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when they turned up .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap , the K@@ ian enam@@ els and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
S@@ kin@@ ner was the man who remained with them , when they saw the potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots , which now has been un@@ folded .
Hin@@ y , Kenn@@ y - who set up four years ago with Ho@@ y sealed - and S@@ kin@@ ner put a Olympi@@ ad in the qualifying round , but in the top @-@ round per@@ pen@@ sions of the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
round about his lap , but Kenn@@ y gave the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner .
a strategy change made a major part of the transformation , in case of execution in a higher speed to slow it to slow it and above all S@@ kin@@ ner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert from his position and fell S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they got up to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a sm@@ iling comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up a Olympi@@ ad record in the final round and beat the world champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the page of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys gave birth to the fact that he fell into a weak start to the railway .
he returned this statement later , and there was no obj@@ ection of England rival .
this time there was no problem with such a victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined together in the last three months .
we have so many world tit@@ els so badly , that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with its shape , it is in the area of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese of the from Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels little lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten for the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition for the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ in W@@ ig@@ gri@@ dge , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record , won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the contest on the second day of the contest .
he was cont@@ ested by yesterday with evidence against the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the respective women competition , tomorrow continued and finished , av@@ ance Laura Des@@ p@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team left his strong track team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of med@@ alli@@ on .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations were driven for Rio .
the drama work in the background , so the resignation of the techni@@ cian Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April among S@@ ex@@ alt - and mobility of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation GB@@ S , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland , due to the abol@@ ition of the energy demand
the Future of aluminium shells from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at the game because the system operators shall terminate the energy contract and thus exp@@ ands all delivery applications such as the supplier &apos;s energy companies shared .
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to be commissioned .
a maximinum payout of a maximinum payout runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland will be on the game .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closing time .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ ic effects , as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A closed the point of Henry melt , which led to a clamping force of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melting of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland is losing money and ris@@ ky a closure .
this step follows the year @-@ long spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the installation .
AG@@ L , which is the big aluminium shells with its Lo@@ y Yang A plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , distributed that three other owners will be happy to announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority owned by AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; divided the company with .
AG@@ L continues to be the so @-@ called &quot; securing transactions , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 months notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L goes from that the contracts for the financial year 17 will contribute to the income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the revenues of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong dates for large trading markets .
AG@@ L shared that it has already written the value of contracts in its annual decrease of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A told that the decision to book the agreements to operate the Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting of the melting or the power supply to the melting process . &quot; not ad@@ ver@@ able .
the US company said that 2010 had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have been to come into force in 2010 , even if there is still a statement found , why it has withdrawn from the contract .
analy@@ st war@@ ns due to the bad economic circumstances of the sector before the possible closing of the Portland sm@@ iling in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume around 600 meg@@ awatts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ awatts .
if both plants should disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ es@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people who I love , I brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to the crying , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an family ) , such as they forget the cover of their sister and ends with a classic t turn : they all have a surprise .
this represents the kl@@ ee@@ ee@@ pers of a child program ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You da@@ w@@ alled that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , with hon@@ est@@ y of a character card on a transmitt@@ ing at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is needed to take part in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the sept@@ ation issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began .
K@@ end@@ all S@@ ister Kim likes her for what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ edition is the most recent edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a gir@@ th that re@@ sembles a photo band as a fashion journal , the output draws a large number of commer@@ cially available ( see fiber Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) of the 8@@ 32 pages of the press ( 615 pages advertising ) .
the dis@@ closure of its Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ tive that during the last two years the journal hasn &apos;t crossed images from the official announcement of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Moss .
in recent years there were clearly &quot; celebr@@ ities , the fashion &quot; as &quot; bab@@ es , &quot; the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar award winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mr@@ s Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; anti @-@ break@@ er model &quot; of its generation - is located in good society .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous persons , or reality Stars or yo@@ ung@@ sters , who know how to record a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is based on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , published on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success .
with its Reality @-@ TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always ten@@ sion@@ ed in the fashion world .
in June he critic@@ ised Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were very high , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but at the point of failure , the point seems to be positioned at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she goes for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertisement for your Grun@@ er of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures from their respective payload apps .
she sold her pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their free time she is visible in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers have a year 160@@ ,000 people each year
more than 160.000 the most common shares of the country are rejected annually by the municipal institutions , while the industry has taken over the effects of further aver@@ ages for already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queens@@ land three of five people - mostly elderly persons , immigrants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ just delay and similar , with their search for free legal advice and legal help .
legal services of the community , which are already over@@ crowded , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centres will be losing a further 30 percent of their federal media .
the director of the commune of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Federation of Municipal Centers revealed that thousands of people had been rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation will only be worse , without the abol@@ ition of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Queens@@ land community centres are chron@@ ically financed , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave non @-@ violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and pressing debt , families who have been dismissed by divi@@ ding workers - all these people have problems of legal type and this survey shows that they can not get the help you need them .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will be reduced by 30 percent , which means that thousands of helpful people from Queens@@ land to be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the General Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Staff and the Federal Minister of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to take up this middle abbrevi@@ ations immediately so that people can get the help you need to maintain their legal problems .
last year , the government &apos;s government had fulfilled their additions to the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the municipal centres and their customer groups as well , that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : pol@@ l of the survey : SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for government forces SPD and CD@@ U .
this gave representative pol@@ ative surveys conducted by the Institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; Newspap@@ er ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black governmental coalition could close to the north in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good chances to introduce the government &apos;s government leaders .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent over five years .
according to the survey , the party was only just under the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ s@@ D .
the left hand came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
in spite of light losses of 6 per cent ( previously : 8.7 per cent ) again in the Schwerin Land@@ tag .

according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD issued only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 percent .
they can still be behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time at the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
today the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty big .
the built @-@ in memory was eight Meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be enough for approximately two selenium with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euro lovers can buy lovers still on the Internet , but they originate from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
but 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; Office at the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ al format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails sent and received , also by fax , the Communic@@ ator could be reached .
even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser if also slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
the price is quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros .
the average sales price of an smartphones in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could see in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
ever since then everything is different .
the wise phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile au@@ ster@@ ity of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled by Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ate the market , who came to the market all much later than Nokia .
ever and be online everywhere , this is a lot of everyday life today .
there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2015 .
about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple are sold alone by 555 million copies .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
in addition , the well @-@ running business of the countless app provider and the telecommunic@@ ation concert will come .
around the smartphone in the meantime , a whole industry has been produced .
the decisive breakthrough for mass market occurred at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple boss Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communications , easy to use on touch screen .
the winning stre@@ ak of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market .
it hat@@ ch , Black@@ berry has to fight .
we now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention , a self @-@ comprehen@@ sible .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on its mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all the smartphone even now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in the Siemens executive board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the date of permanent accessi@@ bility is now regarded as a curse and blessing .
England needs to wi@@ den the olymp@@ ic spirit of He@@ ath@@ row and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only available in our local municipalities and in all London , but in the whole country of renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions have benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and again , we will be able to create new possibilities for local and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we will already make 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they prec@@ eded us in London 2012 , there will be such a challenge to think that the challenge of the extension He@@ ath@@ rows is too large .
it was told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ler were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to survive , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every question .
like the Olympic Games H@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single infrastructure project .
extension is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on wit@@ ty growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in all GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row that has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third running ste@@ g , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we extend this Olympic spirit of He@@ ath@@ row and He@@ ath@@ row , as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which may be proud of the England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ game &quot; regarding display blocks
for companies that earn money online , according to one of the software vend@@ ors , try to handle ad @-@ block attempts , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ er . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would block a blo@@ cking on his desktop page , Ad@@ block plus a blo@@ g@@ post created that users can update their filters in the program to block advertising in social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding regarding his advertising display , in order to detect the indication of the detection , which part of the page advertising is to be difficult to detect .
but ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the present@@ able Open Source Community and envel@@ ops have been underway since the invention of repor@@ ters in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media is left in the battle , is a strong indi@@ z for this , as a wor@@ r@@ ying indicator blo@@ oming for the industry .
according to a study , according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people le@@ aks in the world ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1,@@ 03 billion active users , which access to fac@@ ebook over their mobile devices , hand y@@ wer@@ ed 84 per cent of the advertising took fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks .
the company has shown on display blocks on Desktop PCs , as mobile display blocks have no effect on Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker with .
advertising on your desktop PC makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues , so Facebook is worth the investment of such a stri@@ de .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update his &quot; ad pre@@ acher tool &quot; to update the people more control over it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ r@@ ying new filters , because they would also block content on the site that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are planning to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message with &quot; &quot; &quot;
repor@@ ter blocks are a silent means , so we have focused on developing tools such as ad pre@@ ferences instead , to place more control in the hands of the people .
woman at suspected suicide in Swiss motorway
the sacrifice lay in the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway .
the police calls witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a prob@@ able self @-@ suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman took her in the dark , &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police testified in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss resident in the age of 49 was that of several vehicles , including a truck car , wanted to kill themselves .
they died still on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some are still not yet identified , the police , those , and every witness of the incident , have decided to report themselves .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ ice to the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
that is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said the court of court . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases , in which one person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers must not assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acquitted when she had a man over@@ ride and killed , who had been killed one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had been drinking and is un@@ conscious on the street , the court took place .
the Court noted that the polic@@ eman delivered to an emergency call -- on a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident at Thursday near Morges should report on the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate od@@ ell : Venus was once liv@@ able
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate models , Venus was likely to be inhab@@ itable .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus on the basis of tools and algorith@@ ms that re@@ semble clim@@ ates of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have been made binding on its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously shown that the slow turn of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , similar atmosphere , and still slowly changed .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet was probably more dry regions as the earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from a faster waste .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ Model simulation , the slow reconstruction of Venus is almost two months long , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io declared in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a rainbow in order to par@@ agli@@ de the surface from a large part of the sun .
the result is average @-@ temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that re@@ sembles the evolution that was presum@@ ed by planet research .
although they were probably inhab@@ itable , the Venus -- was exposed to a lot of heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billion years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra@@ violet light .
when its Hydro@@ gen returned only one thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in the ge@@ ophy@@ si@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy acts as a trainer of Aval@@ on
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ on and led to a lower part of the teams in the decision of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and understood that the association will immediately search after a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ on with energy , passion and destination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy expressed in a position .
I have thought long and much more about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give it more depth , it needed and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a guide on decisions that affect the performance of the teams .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had been hired on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked his contributions for the team .
&quot; Patrick wrote me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded as the winner of the Jack Adam Awards during its debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the association to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed the late season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and Aval@@ on .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers do not take talks , put on strike .
the labour strug@@ gles regarding the remuneration for northern oil workers are exposed , while all the men @-@ parties set up for a new discussion round at the table , they said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil @-@ field service providers group were spor@@ adi@@ cally performed on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to rest@@ art@@ ed the off@@ end process of the current battle , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep some full day sessions in the next week , which will start at the beginning of next year to re @-@ start the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s classification is followed by a 10 percent decrease for on@@ shore @-@ contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company will provide the required room to come across the market .
Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on his oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ cent@@ en@@ eries with the British energy company BG Group is ration@@ alised .
as a result of the lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation which led by the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish Par@@ liam@@ entary Council of Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leader in order to discuss one of the greatest work camps , which took place since one generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star@@ board of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with Kepler &apos;s dream teles@@ cope had helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the star con@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the observ@@ ances are rotating at different rates and in which connection the rotary @-@ time rooms with the planet .
&quot; we hope that through the same our results , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the observ@@ atory of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is 445 light years from the earth .
many stars in this constellation were originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they now turn the fastest .
to peak rot@@ ational rates , these 5 @-@ stars large quantities of the star are coming out .
since the winds are traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have an extended effect on the stars .
if a star is aged , his rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of every star by question@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able death @-@ spot -- such as sun spot -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates suggests that a more massive star slower pace than a less massive star .
re@@ sembles compar@@ es the stars with dances , whereby major stars of slow pi@@ rou@@ ches rotate as smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare loc@@ ating qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the observ@@ atory of the Ple@@ j@@ ams offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s still a lot before us , we would like to learn more about how the How , when and why stars should slow down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and its colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the astronom@@ ical journal .
a disputed bas@@ eball star starting from

after his emotional back@@ cut dis@@ closure , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professionals will wear on August 12 against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys a last time the trick of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye &apos; to the &apos; good@@ bye All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Particip@@ ant of Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable players in the League , in 2009 he won the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature under a tenth year contract was secured by 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contra@@ ction on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as an advisor and youth coach - with a full content .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for its teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to make some milestones .

for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was so controversial is the appearance outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was forbidden in &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was locked up to 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .

&quot; the League might even have a pleasure for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said that I was .
his f@@ arewell days do not run noise .
while many bas@@ eball le@@ gends have yet received the big stage once again , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Dest@@ inski are the first di@@ op@@ ing@@ cases
im@@ pregn@@ ated : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ ing , weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Target @-@ inski from Poland will not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ ed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a caught athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition , the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ inci@@ dents have become known for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swimming pool in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the athlet@@ ic athlet@@ ics competitions came this news .
in Ch@@ en , the Di@@ ure@@ tics of Hydro@@ chloride was already proved on the last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ im@@ ing agent for d@@ oping sub@@ stan@@ zen .
Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon in their expulsion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.09 seconds they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the suburbs of 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B test and a hearing .
the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands for Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ ah from a message : &quot; we are working together with the International Sports Court for CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S for san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio le@@ ak@@ age the news about the positive test with Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; explained the Athlet@@ ics Men &apos;s Athlet@@ ics .
according to the report , it is said to act with the bond substance EP@@ O with the verb@@ al substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended in provisional release , according to B@@ NT , the B test should already be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov reported immediately to speak with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men would not pull the right words , &quot; he said , &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are already been excluded . &quot;
this means that all the weights from the chron@@ ically un@@ loaded nation can not participate in Rio .
in Friday , &quot; Adrian Dest@@ inski &quot; was also known as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z in class up to 85 kg as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested for three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both ends the intake , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is a further severe blow for the repor@@ ter of the entire sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF had the start of the entire Russian team even to an exception for systematic D@@ op@@ ings , too , also the lungs are produced in Rio numerous bad news .
in the racing sport also the former clubs in China had taken care of heavy disputes between the athletes .
thus , the French@@ man C@@ amil@@ le Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion of Sun Yang Pet@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I will hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French Radio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun arose at the heart of a meditation on the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping sc@@ ammers , &quot; said this .
in 2014 , Sun was positive at the Chinese championships positive on the stim@@ ulation of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock .
dat@@ enk@@ lau : the per@@ fi@@ de black@@ presses her ran@@ som her ran@@ som
programm@@ ers of detection malware , currently stands targeted companies - and are successfully successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware of the malware , under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies have been surveyed at least once , some several victims of an attack with er@@ press@@ er software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a Ran@@ som@@ ware extraction .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to bring the money required by the Daily funds to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators specialized their compres@@ sors software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes in attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential ran@@ som ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private use .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the poll@@ ut@@ ant software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ uck @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ es programs were still designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then it was discovered the perpet@@ rator software for itself .
in the past few months , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was sho@@ cked quickly in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates after a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , she seek@@ eth targeted files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files are encrypted with the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the original sustainable .
then , the software presents the requirements of the im@@ print .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must be money - mostly in the form of cr@@ yp@@ assing Bit@@ coin .
but where for private use the personal photo database is on the game , it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage fails when a Ran@@ som@@ ware occurs .
22 per cent of the affected German companies accounted for loss losses of Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent , even the business activities were forced to break down , in case of a case , people in life .
in Germany , several hospitals already had been victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say always to the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , but it only promotes the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , their data will get back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of perpet@@ rator in operation in view of it .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good rep@@ utation .
in a recent study the security researchers of F @-@ Secure led the user surface and contact with the compression , and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims by chat as they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and will be redeemed by individuals after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies have to pay part hard and pay the five @-@ digit rate to withdraw their data .
in view of the potential high and relatively low @-@ risk profits , the h@@ acker is always professional and share the work explained security professionals from the Internet provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
likely , however , it is likely that there are three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers sell their loss software in the form of a software module to the actual im@@ print .
the previous Malware kits were created by malware , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is a adap@@ table pool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the compres@@ sors will then look for further h@@ acker to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you are log@@ ically in one of the underground , buy the set of a crime and commissioned a further , to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is eff@@ ected by a certified machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crime shall over@@ take the det@@ ain@@ ees with the spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ase survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to cut back @-@ up using file back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data is no longer a threat to successful exploration , the perpet@@ rators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or price quot@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ uck @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means the damage potential according to type of data is still a multiple higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators could now have completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety for@@ ger , as it could get a thermo@@ stat with the Internet connected by the Internet .
in the middle of winter , the fre@@ ak of a der@@ art blocked heating may be well worth a ran@@ som .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the perpet@@ rators started to block a whole production road in a factory in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty un@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually established in everyday life as extremely flexible .
although only 1.@@ 60 m heigh@@ ted HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first series as well as in the F@@ ond .
the materials of the inner space are well processed and work pleas@@ antly , only the cockpit of the inner surface falls slightly .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just a trunk of 453 l at high and 10@@ 26 l on the back of the back , but the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical , as it sounds : the seat areas of the back@@ bank can be folded like cinema arm@@ chairs and therefore provide the storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceilings .
the boot room can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .
however , his work is likely to be qui@@ eter further qui@@ eter .
the average daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is still another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering wheel should be a little direct .
in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; , the equipment is not desired to be desired .
for the safety systems of the City @-@ emergency braking system ( runs up to 32 h ) , the coll@@ ision system and the track assistant .
sometimes the coll@@ ision was irrit@@ ated , because he evaluated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ed@@ itable objects . &quot;
the teles@@ cope works very reliable .
and the intelligent speed controller acts to the traffic sign and thr@@ ott@@ le the speed when needed .
the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and more .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI connector are placed under the arm@@ rest and therefore can be easily reached slightly .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much , the fuel he receives from 20000 Euro , diesel starting from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday use .
airline is not liable : fall on the passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Hig@@ her Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) for lack of liability is due to danger of air traffic , ar@@ gued the Hig@@ her Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken up a knee rest at the fall .
however , the accident could happen everywhere - it is handy for a general life @-@ risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease : when paid the organizer
during their journey , you can only get money back after their journey , when the cause of the disease is to be found in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than 10 per cent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the hearing case a family was heavily affected on the second day of their tur@@ bo@@ lau@@ bs heavily on di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting .
you spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease resulted back the vac@@ ation@@ ists to a defective blade , which allegedly pol@@ lute the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view to have been a lack of life and def@@ endants against the organizer .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success before the court .
indeed , the def@@ ensive situation in fact was defective .

surely , our country will not answer the violence of perpet@@ rators with hatred and split .

better traffic flow on the highway ad@@ br@@ inger
it is st@@ ew regularly on the road @-@ road - here a picture from November .
but that is supposed to change : the order deposit must be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand on the ambient road every night in the spot , when they drive through the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road building is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) in the area between the Hammer street and the exit Wes@@ eler Road that is only 700 meters away .
drivers can then connect directly from the hammer street on the right .
the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early , making the total exp@@ ir@@ ation of the exp@@ ir@@ ated section of the Bundes@@ strasse 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the tram stop on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return au goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ pipe on B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic will only be guided via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built over three years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge does not have the necessary load capacity to take in particular the heavy duty of traffic .
how long of this commitment and that it is going to pass through it , the permanent state could not say .
however , the bridge has to be expected : for the bridge has an official residual use of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal limit of the country , the state operations are aware of the traffic light time in the school holidays because of Dis@@ abilities .
the traffic will be carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday in the building site on Wednesday .

rain instead of star@@ ry : hope on weather conditions
the weather has made the star h@@ itch @-@ Gu@@ ards in the southwest of Germany in the night for Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night must have been well suited for clouds and rain . the chairman of the observ@@ atory in Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many star@@ ry sky on the sky .
with the stell@@ ations , you are about Per@@ ei@@ den , which belong to the fastest observ@@ atories of 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .

relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll away forever , at night , one is stun@@ ted for hours , in the morning there is no more thinking about sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one of these problems is in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of the adults sleep problems and more than ten per cent are often found their sleep often or permanently relaxing .
how are sleeping problems or sleeping problems ?
there are several forms of sleep problems , and there can be diverse causes from them , highlights Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ eze , Member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ atory and Sle@@ en@@ sic Medicine .
what you understand less among them , however , the In@@ som@@ nie , so an input and sleeping distur@@ bing .
in fact , many people feel free to sleep , as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wagner , a member of the German Haus@@ inary association with practice in the Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
behind this , organic , psych@@ ic or non @-@ related factors can , but also medicines .
not rare is the sleeping expression of another condition .
&quot; very early to watch is often above all with a depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ eze .
and it may be that different factors meet each other .
for example , who has a band@@ ing case , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and starts bl@@ ending , about all @-@ day problems and worry about it , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one use sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
if you do not sleep over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and not imp@@ aired on day should go to the doctor , av@@ enge We@@ e@@ eze .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : it is un@@ beaten , tired , tired , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has atmospheric fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints such as stomach or heada@@ che .
in order to prevent the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , including behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ ors , or drugs - classic battles only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quiries .
in Germany there is hardly any medical medical medi@@ ator in Germany , emphas@@ ised Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the inter@@ disciplinary medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore one should contact with sleeping difficulties at first contact , av@@ enge We@@ e@@ eze .
it can clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in the sleep , and what happens there ?
for the examination in the slaughter @-@ up rates of medicine , for example in s@@ nor@@ ing with bre@@ aths , in case of disease problems , or when you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping corner , Fi@@ etze explains .
it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not have a lunch break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the cab@@ bage , one walks to his normal time .
besides the electrodes , there is a Nas@@ en@@ br@@ ille , a chest strap and a feel@@ ers at the finger .
Moreover , a camera is characterized by the ceiling .
how can you refuse the problems in the handle ?
there are pretty many screws where you can sit for a better sleep .
we@@ aver@@ s counts : regular sleep - and recording times , not too long in bed , on the day not sleep , not watching television to sleep , alcohol , and at night not at the watch - then one starts to calculate immediately , and that &apos;s all and not eligible .
what about the jungle camp with missing med@@ alli@@ ons in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself as a dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
he had brought gold for the first time in Doha in December 2014 and presented his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has put them on Facebook prior to master@@ ing the Ex @-@ team mate .
&quot; in a country where a Olympic champion gets 20,000 € pre@@ premium and a jungle King 150,000 € should be surprised to any lack of medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote to Friday on his Facebook page .
the conveyor system in the racing sport is bad , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ checks are very good .
thus we can not compete with countries that promote very much and do not even operate in the topic D@@ oping - or even run it .
&quot; I do not tell that the controls should be set , &quot; he explained further .
if he would like to start com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly the way to keep it with countries .

airport : bonds from luggage
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the Düsseldorf Airport
civil servants of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police managed to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years .
the Tat@@ ars had committed several pocket and luggage par@@ aly@@ sis as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognised in the area of the Düsseldorf airport in Düsseldorf , which was known as the polic@@ emen of the past theft .
the two women and two men had celebrated several Del@@ ic@@ te since mid @-@ July and had been par@@ ted , labor and especially professional .
the specialists of the crime @-@ Commissioner 34 can also refer to the sealing of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , and to follow their deeds .
they had a total of over 15,000 Euros .
built in the old town , a few lime streams , in the meantime , another head@@ stone street in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in works on the first sight , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the east to the west , one comes to playing places , a refresh@@ ed nur@@ ser@@ y and a bi@@ ol@@ ation .
a man &apos;s façade on the facade of a grey house has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite to a Li@@ dl that will soon be demolished , it will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the permanent real estate company Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in is called , however , in recent weeks , however , preferred to burn with burning cars .
for the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents have now occupied rental income , but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the German internal conductor handle left several times for a tough demonstration of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ smith who had been cleared three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , the parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , newly renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown owners of the premises .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance of the spati@@ ality had been illegal , and one day later police and construction workers went under the ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
in this summer afternoon the road is peaceful : parents will walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun and others enter@@ tain - late late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in Kiev , and J@@ ana * , who are here three children , are mainly generated by the police presence .
with the residents of the skin projects they share the concern for rent and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound after an Kie@@ z , who wish to become pro@@ li@@ stic plaster on the left hand of v@@ and@@ on .
the tr@@ ench , which the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police between house @-@ occupied and their neighbours exists , obviously not exist .
Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which is also in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average and high level of poverty .
in 1990 , there were also a number of houses in the former GDR . in 1990 , numerous houses in former GDR were occupied , including almost the whole mainst@@ ay street completely near the Rig@@ s .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under a great police station , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga , and will still be inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly popular for magnets and elec@@ tr@@ lin@@ ers from all over the world : now we divide the inhabitants of the GDR &apos;s times and former house @-@ occupied houses .
this also makes herself more noticeable in the rent , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ s are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them in un@@ raised slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were cast out with color .
no other road was mentioned for this year so often with the words &quot; Left autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason that no neighbors could see the problem as a problem , that they could not necessarily be affected by the crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body infr@@ in@@ gement is estimated to be almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the criminal off@@ ences of atomic facts , which ten@@ ds to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for the first time in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of un@@ certainty .
as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they that have not been determined .
even the famous burning cars will be able to give it directly in the Riga R@@ ī@@ ga anymore .
for the studied archit@@ ect@@ in , her street is no criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one gets one another , lives together on the street and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has become aware of the Riga street - and stayed .
for this reason , it was also important that the inhabitants got their street : by the police , the policy and the media , all in July all the Sig@@ ns sho@@ re@@ dness of the town council .
however , in the eyes of living even as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by tri@@ po@@ uring new buildings in former building mos@@ quit@@ oes that for@@ ge the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the property of the property that are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely no gu@@ in@@ thei@@ rs . &quot;
but what should one do if any one hears someone ?
since , on all sides , fru@@ stration can be used , even by the police and the inhabitants .
for individuals who are looking for more than color bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the hood and the left scene belonged to the pine trees .
those who go , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub @-@ quarter , there can be po@@ or@@ ly toler@@ able via noise .
all of them only presented with pre @-@ names presented persons are asked not to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is a new refugee
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organis@@ ator .
she is a social worker in front of the spot .
in July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee agency for Ur@@ bach .
the social educational team assi@@ sts the team of the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it looks as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else .
rain customer from the working group indicates that the Hon@@ or of Hon@@ or are more than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ ver@@ le is now there , the da@@ zz@@ ling Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has especially a problem .
so , some - less spra@@ ying rather than rather , rather than the multitude of desire , meant that the administration wanted to write out the place .
we searched for an administrative service with a talent for Langu@@ ages and people , linked to a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just an e@@ ager wo@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
above all , it will go to organisation , working with men on site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been in operation for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position on three years long term .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le Hon@@ or , and director , supported by Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ al .
there are large and small issues , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are located in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a significant problem has been found for some time , apartments for the connecting whis@@ per has been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection of the connection .
they need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or renovation of these accommodation must bear the municipalities yourself .
the responsibility changes from the regional office and the commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been designed as very difficult for some time .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
it didn &apos;t work until now , if you need to find private apartments , Deu@@ ver@@ le .
therefore we must have shared apartments , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are training places , training places , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pl@@ ings for refugees and migrants who need to be displaced .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help Haus@@ er , do non@@ profit work - and motivated and very ti@@ dy , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
it hopes that the work leads to a positive effect on the community .
that is no employment therapy . &quot;
but it doesn &apos;t work only work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer .
people need to develop an en@@ rich@@ ment feeling .
so there are offers such as sport , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so ski@@ p here also management and volunteer .
it is centrally that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain to the refugees that it takes , and they can make sense of sense , for example with language courses !
those who want to develop this feeling , he could not be able to work in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t want to work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate .
the significant majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people hon@@ est@@ ly say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , where nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two seem to be afraid of ra@@ dic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client says quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ hood n@@ ai@@ v might call it . &quot; a residual risk can and if they do not exclu@@ de them .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents were also subject to refugees .
they had the fear that the ass@@ ass@@ ass@@ esses they bring them completely in their call .
&quot; they want to show that they do not have anything to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers have to look at the spot and in the region .
in the background , they always have a new share of refugees and migrants coming to Ur@@ bach soon .
do Germany need an upper limit ?
this question clearly stated to answer the policy .
actually it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there , where we would like to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has also been very close to integrate existing human beings .
there are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , let them be able to help them both women .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
