<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Economic policy in comparison: IT's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - that would like to prevent both Clinton as well as trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidate, however, are at the tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in a doubt rather small and warns before, as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton encouraged the economy to death and regulate the economy to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the other hand, it would be different, claimed trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return regulation massively, and it is powerful for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax principles, for private people and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has given certain tasks to meet himself, he has to open the discrimination of the discrimination and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invested in the needs, Trump and Clinton say almost what is the same.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidates announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and will be rejected by the state-rites-wing-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, at Trump, could still be partitioned with internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clarifying are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal extraction in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible to terminate in the area of protected areas in the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, against its investment program, Clinton wants to expand and calls for: "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only at the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, these two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transcribed business agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the USA do not want to isolate the international trade - but just better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Then they should be paid better, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump is to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be, then he says, he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the major discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy from the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to stimulate growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him before, that the budgetary deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton stands Clinton who wants to ask for at least of the rich, that they will pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who are alone to flee almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are cheerful.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich, Germany, in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Sagrada Familia and Munich's office.</seg>

<seg id="24">There are other reasons for the escape: "many do not steal of them, because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In her home, they have experience with sexualized violence, forced laborers, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives you away.</seg>

<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that when they come to Germany as soon as they come to Germany, do not think.</seg>
<seg id="31">The women in refugees too often would be considered as inferior and mischief if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="32">That means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in Munich, are traumatised, estimates it.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are as usual, that they say nothing.</seg>

<seg id="38">On the question whether they like from a similar project like in Munich in their incomprehension area, some answers with No.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there are not so anything in self-catering flats in the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also in Schwaben, women alone cannot be accommodated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press conference of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Lower and Central franken, there are places in some common areas or houses only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="46">Above all, the shower room should be easily accessible and accessible for women, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel the need of this protection, one can read the rush, which gives it to the house in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey arrived on Tuesday to announce their hands and to publish the official end of the eight months of the words of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish defender in the gold-gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace in reception, I cannot withstand this reconciliation, that Ankara is the propitiation of reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the wrinkles, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putinto smiles worked narrowly and he shined hardly any heat, even for his affection conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, he said repeatedly," "" "dear friend" "" "- according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard that the Earth would never happen anything.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin was able to show sustainable cooling, that the Russian state of Russia had nothing forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather the cause of the crisis was the first, what he mentioned in its introductory statement: the surplus of a Russian campaign by the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was waking up.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to have fallen in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even though it was even bigger, since it was committed by a familiar friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is hard to build up again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media conducted a severe, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once it seemed, the Turks would wear for all the blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the serious disguessing officials, Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He was contested by this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place therefore, because Putin received the withdrawal from the President of Erdogan, who wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a way victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a truce, clearly on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan takes the first line to all the friends that he can get after the last month of a failed coup d'état close to his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, terrorist attacks on Turkey had also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions did not hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of Charterns that every year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The amount of the amount is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">Tour operators and chargers will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a delayed onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State TV endorsed fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports come back.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report published in Vedemosti as follows: "tourists here long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is wretched to the West, because the response to the attempted power of power was considered the weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To do this, the persistent groll of the EU accession negotiations for accession to the EU's accession negotiations and Putin - the erpike is to go out of cool sentiment and decrease the relation of Turkey to the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of government won a bonus in Ankara with security, that he requested a coup d'etat for the elected state of state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a self-comprehensible for Moscow, which even has a deeper fear of regiments.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the summit in this glorious palace built on the sea in Russia and Turkey, such as an analyst once described me" "" "alliance of external sides" "" ": two countries that have driven away from the west, and it is now banned." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between both of the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey were able to support each other.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be characteristic that after nearly three hours of first talks, both presidents on the press conference said that they could not have experienced the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the president of Turkey missing it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize these." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">It is not a clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member of Turkey shot the Russian battlesjet - it certainly makes it better to talk to two heads at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Bank has since then distressed, when she had to be saved almost eight years ago and had to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this period, brand new "RBS" have used to protect other end consumers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It supported international sport with millions of pound to sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.</seg>

<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland but is not initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised head office and the company's IPO are changing to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for the customer business which will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN was interviewed during a visit of clients and staff in Inverness-Shire.</seg>

<seg id="16">I say now that we do not track global targets, but local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own municipalities for something completely different and our employees are working among these brands with the customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations Sponsoring anymore, and that it will increase the perception of various brands in its Sport sponsoring business.</seg>

<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and they had launched these brands.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin was released unexpected by his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a lot of part of the closest trust group of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin opinion that Putin was ordered without giving reasons "the dismissal of Ivanovs arranged by its duties as chairman of the Russian predialect."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanovs for 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he made its completion at the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin, it is called (in Russian) that he later became the officer and Chief Leader of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support its activities as head of government and controls for implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday, that Ivanov asked that Ivanov had asked his position to leave his position as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">See the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made a mysterious one.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time in the most engagements with Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on TV, both men said that the Chief of Staff was back on their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite a smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is here the result of a kind of power in front of?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once opened as potential President, once the Russian environmental policy was to lead us - he fell on big skepsis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the website of the Kremlin said Ivanov, "it's true that I asked you to put this very complex post in early 2012 - it could almost say - complained about four years to trust.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it presents, I have been chairman of the Russian predialect for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, as Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) that was appointed KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his substitute.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people who trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was accepted that Ivanov would have been president of Russia for Putin's second term, as a third-term coup would have put off against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, near allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister, before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensland Crossings with the viaduct - what means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four delays in the "covers," which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slanders.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Finance Keith Brown took the construction site today a visit and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment of construction of the Queensland Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witness of a engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the flow between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a heats, which require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of almost 79% of the whole Brushes are on their place and the last part of the Decks now gets on Rosyth a Betongated for the deck that means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure has a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure of the pioneering high and deep building represents.</seg>
<seg id="15">Following the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the North Sea-deck, we had to close the still existing gap in the North or Landside.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling in the northern access bridge of 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very heated activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively because the viaduct is 222 metres long, about 6,000 tons weighs and had to be pulled down at a gradient of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Uncle, as the tolerances to which the team works, tiny - on each side, they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green: investors will get to be much stronger in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does it react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "action concept for the next meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But war is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First line is about the question: who is supposed to build the favourable apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">One regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD Group president Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "we are looking forward to the Greens" "" "who wants to build urban areas, in future 20 percent of all apartments have to show as social dwellings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the inexpensive apartments can also occur in stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the great reasoning in the town hall is, however, viola: "how do you deal with investors who want to build private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to build investors on such surfaces at least 10 per cent, but as possible as 20 per cent of dwellings as social dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing funding program, which will cost €million and has to be financed, is to be incentives for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so Bratmann: "there is currently no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors a few rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left does not want to add hardness levels for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In spite of this, as the Bratuner, a sharpening of the situation on the residential market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The concept of the action is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not stand completely, because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built-in.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of further around 1300 low apartments whose promotion is going out in the next few years?</seg>

<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning for speaking spokesperson in Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city now.</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get there back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this will not want the owners, the housing units are not.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social dwellings in the western city is drastically increased again, one removes away from the goal of the so-called flow.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting trip to health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The teens and child to play no more after going outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time, on screens, was bemozed in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">For Pokemon Go, it is possible to pick up people from the sofa and let it be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was initially limited to TV, then limited to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and activities are not able to exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm sure of course based on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were created on the characters which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later produced a character set, playing cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of Popculture sank the interest before the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days Pokémon Go had more users than men and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players take their smartphone out without and looking for Pokémons, who are pursued after a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot of the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the Wahn and jumped to the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiki, an app for Apple Watch that pursued 35,000 users, shared that Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the market launch of the game, the number of people who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public clarification campaigns for health, who want to bring about "30 minutes of time to come" "" "of the sofa" "" "to be active every day, because many public messages are boring to health and look of people who look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the significance of sport can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives Sport, reduces his chances to treat cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps to share high blood pressure, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list, which is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are three pillars covered in health - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people do not exclude new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are macroric gamble, which must always be chargeable to something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a breakthrough for himself.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps, such as Fitbit already could follow our activity, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its maturation and the use will be relocated at the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will be united to apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, and help many people in the hunt, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="14">They broke out in tears, when their final score was shown and her long journey was found at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts it into the same league like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports on new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles dominates its sport, 15 world champion - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou's rescue from her said that she has ever seen "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be a final exam in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a last oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not return with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered to be disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace, after they were each with gold and silver in the single multi-campaign of women at the Kunstturnes during the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal at Tuesday, while on the party ceremony, retired teams coordinator in Martha Karolyi was served as an exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on the top of its long distance to the top, never the future is planned, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of its ground exercises - which contain their typical tumbling pass - is matched to Latin American music - at home outside the Olympic Games in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="29">Raisman embraced them gently as she did her Enderive permit - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red, white and blue Eyeliner, as the vision that they once became reality in their collection book.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when it fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22 year old man's chapel mentioned by Americans "Oma," had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their soil practice, she cast down the audience of the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which is sometimes doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I am present under the Women's Olympic Games in Turnen in Turnen and this is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been at every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three turnerders, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie "Hernandez, which inspired for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, the Cathokin is round, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This crew finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has been the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one was one of the female turnerders a Afro American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprisingly Olympic champion in and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but mastery of Gymaisonous routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won with an individual multi-concert event for women of gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manna member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are going to experience the top of this sport, but this turnaround classes do not see in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics will only have four turnerders in the crew. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality sees that Turns are a more expensive sport and Turner first line in private turntables that are exciting for their training, educational, travel and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families). the list can be extended individually.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are lying in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner will receive its entire training and this is a expensive and long term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainers of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainers of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started with the Turnen.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must innumerable the churches of Aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to enable an unaccessible and easily accessible turntable.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events, we have free and affordable turmoons in Harlem for over 15,000 urban adolescents (especially black and hispanic) were trained and national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to provide the youth high-quality turmoons to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnes developed strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and destination for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for professional and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the turmoons and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holocaust Team World team and thank you for so many young girls with a different background motivated to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller moved his immune system and wortists of a serious examination - by giving some of the most tastes and brighter places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Moderator and Traveloator Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a dishwashing button of a tensile toilette and a public telephone in Russia in order to ensure the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of any object, he used a rag-ometer to show himself and to show us what he will be embarked.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results of daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinsing knob of a pulling toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely shock, but actually there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as through its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left what he stretched out, more than a bad breath in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became well-known to test the resistance of his Darms by entering the world as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railways to train stations up to dishwahem of toilets, the task set his immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sammate water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was righteous in his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His proofing showed a thickness of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometric population is fresh used less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refusing, after their Luminometric population was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel movie "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number at different locations like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "this comes the worst thing that I had in a toilet, near."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt more than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will do nothing here, because it's inside inside there.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company pays Mr Wright with Valio Neus, which contains both Mililactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios senior Venice President for snacks, sawing and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa: "we wanted to find the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for viewing and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotic.</seg>
<seg id="25">We introduced the crazy brainstorings, so that we finished, "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of the gut health and how they are associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me say," I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he would have felt some of the things that I have told him, like the eky Russian toilet, which will be shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things, with which it was easier to bring Ian, and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty jobs on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of the survey carried out by the year 2015, 84 percent of all respondents questioned with the wellbeing of stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said that they have at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="28">Because much on the game stands, Sellering gave his SPD now to an especially committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and only just before the AfD (19).</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner to all this?</seg>

<seg id="11">De Maizière took a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, before he presented his conclusions for the security in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are falling out therefore all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot is already known, announced, announced that a new security authority shall take care of the crate encrypted communication, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements for passenger data and weapons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière starts a second run for proposals to date with the SPD: he wants to turn sympathy for terror groups under penalty and hit the jihadists with double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="17">"there will be difficult points for the SPD," grants the CDU-man.</seg>
<seg id="18">He still keep this for reasonable, and demands nothing that I have no opportunities with the coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presents de Maizière also.</seg>
<seg id="20">They partially have it in itself: it is planning quick approach to shifts and more possibilities for the arrest of people before the deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who have been fetched into the country before their smartphones will quickly be revealed and social media accounts for a security check in advance.</seg>
<seg id="22">In case of delayed asylum seekers, he wants some even worse than so far - such as those who commit penguards or throw away their papers to disclose their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is political and legally uncle.</seg>
<seg id="24">Maneuver has even been unbalanced, and can be asked to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And in some points - with inequality treatment of Gedulled to an example - the question arises: what does that actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, it says Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it's not to talk about that the assassesses of Ansbach and Würzburg were.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people did seem to worry about security in the face of the high refugee.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that the people tend to do so, now also in electoral times are not clumsy.</seg>

<seg id="31">Volkswagen himself uses the term "Warranty" but not as it was in company's offices.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen offers the possibility to upgrade to a workshop half a year after rearmament about a workshop in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the customer interests it is important to avoid that there is no damage to any other damage, which does not have anything to do with the scandal, as it was called.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who is buying sound panels?</seg>
<seg id="2">Rich men like middle ages love.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you to comment on the commentary board, in order to oversow it under the pseudonym Non Alleensamenmen's age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the versatile reformation of sound panels is not related to a boom in millennials, who wants to welcome new identity of physical objects but due to mid-life-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record, are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional significance: older record runners keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow me the camera, while in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit, before I stand, keep my hands and give something best as: "so, let's take a loser Look on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly located at its own charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers have been resident - there are still a handful of fantastic table stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would ask the camera thought to turn the camera to the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, I am from Sister Ray (file number: two young women, three males mean age) into the Reckless Records (number of men: eight males, one woman, probably around the 20) sequence is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, question me?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed after my home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records, which he did not afford to buy items, which he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are coming from the late 60s, early 70s, which was published when I was 11 or 12. things I thought to be young in order to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my master.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meets he hits the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media group, people who have heard about the comeback and causes to buy their old boards again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the discussions that I have led, people usually have sworn in as early as 1998 or 1999 in their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the so-emotional significance of panels?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes some seconds in a shop such as Phonica to recognize that record stores a soothing community of DC-inned.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the turntables feel rowed from the digital world and would like to wrap up the stability of confidentified sound plate, of objects, the happy jugenderings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as a collector, and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" they killed a staff of a turnout stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey carried out by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who have purchased a record, they still have not heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player who never use it while 7% of those who buy a record, no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I went through a stack of Bossa Nova Compiles.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of men: three men middle ages) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revica.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone happened recently here and said," "" "I am a record player but I would like to buy a radio head record, that I would like to put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product, less tacit.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who come first slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound boards almost a whole floor, has an underground audience than I go clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos make teenager and women mean age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizers and expert pop instead of experimental jazz drills from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity in customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them can be solitary confined, but fixed psychic traumata very difficult if one stands for 30 seconds next to someone.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around the business for a few minutes, and viewed the Variettos for selling plates.</seg>
<seg id="49">It looks more a mannequake than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, therefore, the collecting of records is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a loving epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business which is said that a new generation of record-lovers will be inspired: urban Outscrap.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket, I observe a group of young teenager, I observe a group of young teenage cameras, who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter superior to buy a Croley disk player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential boards for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see her - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to deal them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in view of that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most for luxury objects like boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research asked that the results of YouGov vote, they give at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectibles, that exist in reality, record shops and onlinework.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people work hard to work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the Bumble by record stores of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while at the rigid view of an unborn, 30-year-old Moderator, who rises above the shoulders of the middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of negotiation this week, the authorities went to Calais that the state should sell, 72 temporary shops, sell, hairdresser services, or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few Euro in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down, because they would be paid a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid, and the local risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups distributed to the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that supported by the state-supported association and other groups, not enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 Provisional shops, but there was a fact that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "is absolutely retrofittable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes, and restaurants can play a much bigger role than just people living in extreme preferences. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of calm plans offer between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the decline was the young Book Kids' Café des camp, which is meant to be profitable after 200 meals a day, English and French classes and advice to asylum, for hundreds of protection needy, unaccompanied minor age in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to get the Kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it is said that the closing time "for the children of a catastrophe would be, of which the youngest eight years old are."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organisations help Refugees and L'Auberge had risen on Friday that the number of living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number now - after a steep increase in newcomers in the course of summer.</seg>

<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>

<seg id="11">This cap is hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>

<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a test for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went already long in favor of the southern sulphur, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "there will be no more potential gold than these games, and that will be called something." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing boat to the last, 220 hard hieve that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting by the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present at the second Olympiagold in the doubling without tax nurse in succession, the first women in the history of the British Sports, which laid a scale in such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all of her 39.ter unleaking use, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes, which led over the surface with the elegance of weaknesses, which is not reflected the type of triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the ruin you can contribute to the content of the battalion who make the difference and there was no thought of sense than the trainer, who didn't know this day, whether he was diagnosed with cancer than it was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky something.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which did it and they did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start treatment beginning in early 2014, outside the season, which could begin the interruption to a minimum, if that under such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore it had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is a challenge, but that makes it a major challenge.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of the victory they went their first thoughts on Williams, who spent some more than otherwise, and thus trying to handle his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery in one deployment in Afghanistan, "I was a emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extremely, but it means much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It's repeatedly, how much that I mean, how much I and Helen and I have worked Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive Danke is on him. he is the best trainer of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person to exercising or wish to wish a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had a lot to reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, keep in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get rid of.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make a little Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to have no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break for one year before making decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week at a wedding, their own with the TV adventure of your Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That could have been too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes here.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat tells you that this filter is inspired by anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensitive against races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are distinctive, intrinsic tools that generate more than 30 million improved selenium per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All the flaws were to be opened to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been drawn in the past critique, in which they accused the app Blackface-front or white skin as a beauty deal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week, some Users proposed a filter, which gave them dark teeth, false teeth and darker cheeks, some critics called a radictive caricecologist of Asia - "yellowing."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether they repeated their repeated controversy on a larger issue, that the company has diversy.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat that it would have been disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as the caricycle of Asia.</seg>
<seg id="12">But external standing, the Rassissmus experienced, reminded the filter of violating clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Other expenses decided to draw the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail we wrote Grace Savapani, a Korean American art student whose tweaking have been widespread throughout the photographs that the filter "violently and it was said to be unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">It added that "it is difficult to argue with the return of a very conflicting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter has not been partriumphed, but that the yellowness was withdrawn into the extreme extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed the cultural tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless seal and integration of integers, of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience for young people - who are different in the breed of a lot more than their older opponents - could expect rather to anticipate Sensiveness.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one has produced a picture of Snapchats filters, "so it's much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu decided that he works as a product manager and engineer for media, to delete their Snapchat account and put others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a set of media and in a telephone interview they said that they believe that rassessing controversy reflect a lack of gasket with Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the great part of white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # DelilSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I either have no different representation of people with other skin colors, so that they can meet people with other skin colors that work there, but not in locations where they are safe or comfortable to tell what to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint which Snapchat has not been left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish any figures for the diversation of its employees and points to its status as private companies.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a speaker has recently set a staff responsible, which focuses on subrepresented population groups and on internal integrity.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said that she will leave their Snapchat account and added, "I ask myself if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="3">Five gates in two games were actually a memorable performance, but Bam (27) told it not to remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the olympic competition and are equivalent to the British in their first place, who remained unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>

<seg id="11">Bam was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (their two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national game of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We had not the work of work in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely moved the ruin completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a return of the suture.</seg>

<seg id="1">Among the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and unrivalled, a rapid-growing seasons between competition and Streets.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is when the olympic fibroel itself would be a burning staff that leaves from the bracelet for swimmers to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queue in the Coffeshop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Leyy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a girl with a dimples, could quite well be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-known TV advertisement if he would have a swimmers, Turner, or even Feeder.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic tramp around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade there are sports species that are not generally accepted: air pistol shoot, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always swim the chest, and may rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest arguments for my particular lovers, then let me feel the attention to the discrete charm of the tramp.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the tramp has already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years, it was perceived that many who had asked, didn't know that it's ever a Olympics portal.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be the regional Ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US athletes sent to the competition, there has never won a medal in the tramp-jump and had been a athlete until 2012, which had managed to get up until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the men and the Chinese, and the Canadian who share their wives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The tramp-jump has a certain external seclue, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ear passable for a clownsschool as they sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am no expert, but only a true enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous citations of his never to end, but also the grazie of the turnaround and diving that combines two sports, which are basically united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much means "diving board."</seg>
<seg id="22">The winner will jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must land a number of falling movements (turning, boobs and saltos) before being landing on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be judged according to official Olympic aproogram after execution, difficulty and flight time. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-perennial athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are competing in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, to top and beyond, sometimes up to the target, sometimes, and back, up to the playground and down the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You are not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the TV transmission also another goal: the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted streak is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a viewer in tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I think of looking for this games as a bit tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers an Atemporium.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or her prunes, seemingly heavier than an astronaut, go down to the top, then effortlessly back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the destination, no mercenaries into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant setting from time and heavy force.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the Endrons as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amidst the Olympia Manie, they speak a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably oversee in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the productivity of consciousness can only be achieved by the case of anxiety and the object of the male US Turner, according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr Dooley awaits its following air, a new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, demand political changes in Ethiopia, struggled for violent opposition to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that eighty-protesters were killed during merging with the police at Schussani.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsed?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, there was one of the most stable countries in Africa, one of the majority of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and far more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people were stormed on the streets and the fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the answer of the government was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses showed that policemen were shot down unarmed and killed by policemen.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, will show how sensitive people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights Reserves an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country and in future it will even be more difficult," Rashid Abdi, the manager of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, in particular in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Ethiopian economy expands its remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pelines in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy, human rights organisations continuously ongoing the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited, and dissidents were brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile, or put into prison, or put them in the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options except protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seek Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopians." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which cover everything from the ground up to sausages in relation to power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions descend along the border to Eritrea; a battle for these raging, disputed line demanded in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced to reuse more or less during the last years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why emotions had been explode under the surface after many years ago, or explode the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, very many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, because cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially with protests, so many people can communicate over internet proxies that hide, where they keep up.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave heed that they were gathered together to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnias in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not a natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since the year, the Amhara prospering mainly Christian high-lands, in politics and economy, while they carried out the Oromos, of which many Muslims are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," "" "Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos saw that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigers, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population, which are dominant in the military, in the intelligence and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leaders, had until his death on a non-public disease in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think of the corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">The analysts say that it was especially discussed in fact, early signs of dissatisfaction, and to use special officers to edit enemies and to make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime," Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst said it, is missing. "</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles, who arrived from the tiger of the North Sea region of North America, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">The analyst say that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many believed that the result will be more blood shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time, Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting, according to analysis of analysts, seemingly stolen from the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many Protestants were killed, even though it were less than in the last months and that time of disturbances declined relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised the Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pelines, as well as for their measurable progress in the poverty level.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal Missy of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And they take a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month of protest in gondar, a amharian city, run by Tigers, and the hatred toward the tiger is more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">The analyst say that protests and other Western allies have put into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights on the neighboring Somalia, even though it has recently shared that this base has closed.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to merge his bundled in an already volatile neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland will usually come on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return on board the Sanna's research on board.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swimming with a speed of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland is only available with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the bottom of the Greenland expedition at the bottom of the North Atlantic, an hour occurs in an average of 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes on, it accelerates the five meter long animal at a speed of 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is nearly as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this one of long loneliness lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen is Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal "Science" in the case of an Greenland expedition, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness" commented on the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock these life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist assumed that Greenland will become a stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland they are difficult to observe, after all they live in the ice-sea front of the coastal waters of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive in the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have to know about the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time-bends, they seem to carry six animals with a transmitter in front of valbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make these sharks: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young icirate.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly chase them sleep sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for kdavers that are removed from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard around the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 cm measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the linear core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens was formed already before the birth of the sharks, which are contained in the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the liner core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore supposed to be after the early 1960s, when atomic weapons try out larger amounts of this radioactive carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 220 centimeters of length of the smallest-smallest animal contained a small surplus of carbon-14 out of the nuclear arm, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their liner core, all major Greenland groups had a normal carbon-14 quantities that arises due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock was shown for a 493 centimetre-long Greenland at the age of 335 while the record-shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could be rearranged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters can be reached on the threshold of the sexually mature, and at the age of 156, Greenland with the absence of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this should be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">There is no coincidence that such methusales live in icy waters, especially in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland expedition, put on the neck a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism living there live animals on sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and alise slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume is growing much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than in one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives in dangerous and should be focused on it as soon as many offspring as possible," explains the Evolutionary biologist "" "." "" "</seg>

<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap, the Kian enamels and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man who remained with them, when they saw the potential in the shallots, which now has been unfolded.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And again, we will be able to create new possibilities for local and companies in the vicinity of Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities we will already make 10,000 new apprentices, 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>

<seg id="8">It was told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blamate ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-fler were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to survive, but Heathrow answered every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Hathrow is for many and not for single infrastructure project.</seg>

<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, which was built in the middle of the two frequencies of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third running steg, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate models, Venus was likely to be inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble climates of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have been made binding on its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously shown that the slow turn of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, similar atmosphere, and still slowly changed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet was probably more dry regions as the earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from a faster waste.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS-Model simulation, the slow reconstruction of Venus is almost two months long," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio declared in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a rainbow in order to paraglide the surface from a large part of the sun.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average-temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was presumed by planet research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they were probably inhabitable, the Venus -- was exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned down by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When its Hydrogen returned only one thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler's dream telescope had helped astronomers to collect the complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the star conjades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers to understand why stars in the observances are rotating at different rates and in which connection the rotary-time rooms with the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through the same our results, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The observatory of the Plejades is 445 light years from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation were originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They now turn the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">To peak rotational rates, these 5-stars large quantities of the star are coming out.</seg>

<seg id="10">If a star is aged, his rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware of the malware, under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies have been surveyed at least once, some several victims of an attack with erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a Ransomware extraction.</seg>

<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the pollutant software," explains Malwarebuck-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds pretty unload, but the HR-V, who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually established in everyday life as extremely flexible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1.60 m heighted HR-V is rather small, passengers have a lot of space in the first series as well as in the Fond.</seg>

<seg id="10">The boot room can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas.</seg>

<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller acts to the traffic sign and throttle the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App Integration and more.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you roll away forever, at night, one is stunted for hours, in the morning there is no more thinking about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one of these problems is in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of the adults sleep problems and more than ten per cent are often found their sleep often or permanently relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping problems or sleeping problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep problems, and there can be diverse causes from them, highlights Hans-Günter Weeeze, Member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlafforatory and Sleensic Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand less among them, however, the Insomnie, so an input and sleeping disturbing.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, many people feel free to sleep, as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagner, a member of the German Hausinary association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, psychic or non-related factors can, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early to watch is often above all with a depression," says Weeeze.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors meet each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a banding case, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and starts blending, about all-day problems and worry about it, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one use sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not sleep over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and not impaired on day should go to the doctor, avenge Weeeze.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: it is unbeaten, tired, tired, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has atmospheric fluctuations or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to prevent the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, including behavioural changes, cognitive behaviors, or drugs - classic battles only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany there is hardly any medical medical mediator in Germany, emphasised Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should contact with sleeping difficulties at first contact, avenge Weeeze.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in the sleep, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the slaughter-up rates of medicine, for example in snoring with breaths, in case of disease problems, or when you don't find the cause of a sleeping corner, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>

<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the permanent real estate company Friedrichshain is called, however, in recent weeks, however, preferred to burn with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">For the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the residents have now occupied rental income, but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the German internal conductor handle left several times for a tough demonstration of the police against the project, the area as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadtersmith who had been cleared three weeks of official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, the parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>

<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance of the spatiality had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers went under the jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer afternoon the road is peaceful: parents will walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun and others entertain - late late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives since 1999 in Kiev, and Jana *, who are here three children, are mainly generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the skin projects they share the concern for rent and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after an Kiez, who wish to become prolistic plaster on the left hand of vandon.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin internal senator and the police between house-occupied and their neighbours exists, obviously not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which is also in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average and high level of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, there were also a number of houses in the former GDR. in 1990, numerous houses in former GDR were occupied, including almost the whole mainstay street completely near the Rigs.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under a great police station, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga, and will still be inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly popular for magnets and electrliners from all over the world: now we divide the inhabitants of the GDR's times and former house-occupied houses.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also makes herself more noticeable in the rent, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigs are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them in unraised slices or freshly painted facades, which were cast out with color.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned for this year so often with the words "Left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason that no neighbors could see the problem as a problem, that they could not necessarily be affected by the crime: criminal offences such as body infringement is estimated to be almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the criminal offences of atomic facts, which tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For the first time in Neugebauer, who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they that have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars will be able to give it directly in the Riga Rīga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architectin, her street is no criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one gets one another, lives together on the street and gets more each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has become aware of the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">For this reason, it was also important that the inhabitants got their street: by the police, the policy and the media, all in July all the Signs shoredness of the town council.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of living even as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: by tripouring new buildings in former building mosquitoes that forge the old inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="37">For individuals who are looking for more than color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the hood and the left scene belonged to the pine trees.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuverle is a new refugee</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuverle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisator.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is a social worker in front of the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">In July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee agency for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educational team assists the team of the administration of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It looks as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rain customer from the working group indicates that the Honor of Honor are more thankful that Deuverle is now there, the dazzling Wollmilchsau, which has especially a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spraying rather than rather, rather than the multitude of desire, meant that the administration wanted to write out the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We searched for an administrative service with a talent for Languages and people, linked to a long-term experience in the field of social work, just an eager womilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it will go to organisation, working with men on site and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in operation for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position on three years long term.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine Client, that Annika Deuverle Honor, and director, supported by Annika Deuveral.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small issues, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are located in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A significant problem has been found for some time, apartments for the connecting whisper has been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or renovation of these accommodation must bear the municipalities yourself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the regional office and the commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed as very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It didn't work until now, if you need to find private apartments, Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore we must have shared apartments, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are training places, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and helplings for refugees and migrants who need to be displaced.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help Hauser, do nonprofit work - and motivated and very tidy, such as Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work leads to a positive effect on the community.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is no employment therapy. "</seg>
<seg id="35">But it doesn't work only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuverle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop an enrichment feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sport, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So skip here also management and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must explain to the refugees that it takes, and they can make sense of sense, for example with language courses!</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who want to develop this feeling, he could not be able to work in Urbach, don't want to work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there is no problem," "" "people honestly say" "" "people, where nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuverle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two seem to be afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine Client says quite clearly, "what manhood naiv might call it." a residual risk can and if they do not exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the assassassesses they bring them completely in their call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they do not have anything to do," says Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers have to look at the spot and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have a new share of refugees and migrants coming to Urbach soon.</seg>
<seg id="57">Do Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly stated to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not arrived there, where we would like to go," "" "Annika Deuverle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has also been very close to integrate existing human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, let them be able to help them both women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
