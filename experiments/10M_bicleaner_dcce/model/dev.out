recent changes in the employment policy of the university t@@ ted that the promotion , for the Lamb which is working hard for such a automatic way as Assistant Professor would be Assistant - as Assistant Professor .

8 need to indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump is to be taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others took it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a breakdown .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges in pol@@ ls , it did not work yet .
ten of the last eleven National surveys conducted Donald Tr@@ ump into the double @-@ digit sector , and some start to wonder how it &apos;s chances of nom@@ ination of a real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the elec@@ toral term .
no claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts empha@@ sized that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys claimed the lead in the rising lines of Herman Cain , none of which only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
there are many reasons why he &apos;d have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bus @-@ Day Super P@@ AC and the conservative European group Club for Grow@@ th now Tr@@ um@@ ps van@@ ish t@@ aps and start to flow down their dollars to rush against him .
here are some current assets , which indicate that the property is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps refle@@ ct@@ ance values can be rotated by 180 degrees .
before Easter Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candidate in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University found that only two of ten re@@ public@@ s seen the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ s have a positive opinion by Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of them say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters were happy with l@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans were told either &quot; or &quot; satis@@ fying &quot; if tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two out of 10 say that they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm , as the Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent ) , they would be thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same over Tr@@ ump ) .
the next time in my enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters think that she would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; dis@@ gr@@ ated if Je@@ b Bush , the favourite of the establishment , became a candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw Tr@@ um@@ ps Tem@@ per as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely expected to critic@@ ise his bom@@ b@@ ative and bel@@ li@@ ding statements , 52 percent of voters think the real control methods for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first successive State of a nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has acted as a leader in Chief of the District , qu@@ no@@ is@@ pi@@ ac &apos;s last week .
even though 44 percent believe that he did not have the personality to effectively execute and close to six out of 10 ignor@@ ance that their temper@@ ament is not into the White House P@@ asse , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters att@@ ested to the idea .
when they place their ring@@ ing , they can hold the republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real .
when they are being questioned , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , we say within a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C , four out of ten last week that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the date when four of ten ends up their money on je@@ b Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters never had the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ s were that Rick Perry win the nom@@ ination that won only 28 % of the final candidates of Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a lot of GO@@ P al@@ ps of Tr@@ um@@ ps are seeing a campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered themselves to another candidates , Tr@@ ump was still canc@@ elling each of them .
some experts believe that the fra@@ in field is likely to join the action @-@ breaking field , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is spread over more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that , in a hypo@@ th@@ et@@ ical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump was re@@ aped .
it has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally on the edge of Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would out@@ lay the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ th@@ et@@ ical head @-@ head @-@ race .
a vast majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say that they formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T shows that only a little more than half of voters , the tr@@ ump sum , they will say that they have already determined its vote .
of course , a lot could happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they wanted to leave the door open to change other candidates .
however , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the most strongest compet@@ itor at the moment of the other out@@ put@@ ties , the Neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as often in tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump into the topic of migration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign , he was referred to a rape crisis two months ago , the immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course went to 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ ative extent of expression of Tr@@ ump is a decisive h@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can Party , and re@@ vo@@ ke the re@@ orient@@ ated efforts .
but according to the new ABC German Post survey conducted by Monday , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ des with the issues of immigration .
as long as the immigration remain in the spot@@ light , the Donald Tr@@ ump would obviously do .
the fru@@ stration can be embar@@ r@@ assed by the government on new levels .
by Donald Tr@@ ump , and Ben Car@@ son now accounted for almost half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially in its field of foreign nationals .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ s as members of the new educational edition of ABC / Post , they prefer to provide a political test experience as someone with government experience .
and they are also angered in Washington as well .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Street / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa published two weeks ago that three out of four I@@ owa @-@ Repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; woo@@ dy . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods of Germany
here in the hob@@ by road there is the most expensive home - with view over the North Sea .
on the street , one square metres of a homeless person is only 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer of objects is limited in objects , i.e. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows where special layers are a square meter for most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student she@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top home types , however , the price is just like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Nations has released a classification of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square met@@ ers@@ .@@ producing high places .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , noted .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not exception as an exception .

in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) are proud now !
however , the Bavaria - defeated in seven European ac@@ up tournaments with Greek Teams , did not want to be the next victims .
they made cour@@ ageous to work out with their open efforts but often nothing to be .
attacks were often started per game adjustment on the left side of Douglas Costa Rica , which was rarely achieved against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger , Omar El@@ ab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i , because of the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger , Omar El@@ ab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more fortun@@ ate from his right , and left his flan@@ k at the left of the upper left of To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half of them was Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when the Olympic car stor@@ ms ide@@ ye Brown found the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 October ) .
then , by direct arrest , the keeper Roberto and her knees kicks off ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bayern dominated the popular game , Pir@@ ew could be somewhat am@@ i@@ fer@@ ous .
however , in Tor@@ ch@@ man Manuel New , however , was decree .
this is about how he de@@ fle@@ ct a shot from ide@@ ye on the lat@@ ted ste@@ erable ( 5@@ 6th ) .

Gu@@ ardi@@ ola also decided on him when he launched the King@@ sley Com@@ an in his United Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
shortly late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and 13 minutes later , everything was clear , while El@@ f@@ T Müller was still in a dr@@ one .

after a smaller group of partly dis@@ rup@@ ted Bavaria @-@ fans in their viewers , apparently the tra@@ ilers of hosts were engaged in words with words and movements , and attacked the security forces and entered their supporters at the Munich College .

who sei@@ ze , has a higher risk of falling teeth
those who smoke , not only are the tongue , but also the teeth - set a Potsdam in long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of wai@@ ver the risk becomes rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a much higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking people the risk of smo@@ kers should lose their teeth early in order to achieve the 2,@@ 5 to 6 times superior .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of dental implants are car@@ ies and infections of the tooth flan@@ k , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
as for these peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and the loss of wear is caused by frequent g@@ um disease in smo@@ kers .
not be defined , how much smoking is also increased the risk of cancer .
however , people who stopped using smoking , could reduce the risk in just a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until her end@@ an@@ gering travel to the level of non @-@ smo@@ ker , explained the first @-@ what Thomas Dietrich with the English University of Birmingham .
if you need to convince humans to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , study manager H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking is shortened the life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and containers and , according to our insights , are also on good dental health by the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by ignor@@ ance , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
previous studies had already been pointed out that smoking is the risk of having early teeth .
the new long @-@ term study sub@@ w@@ alled the findings .

EU Commission proposes in the dispute over the TT@@ IP office .
the EU Commission proposed for comprehensive reform to the current trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement TT@@ IP , proposed by the European Commission .
the controversial private security equipment for disputes between companies and states are intended to be replaced by a transparent system , which is clearly equivalent to more traditional recipes in its function .
&quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens of the citizens , &quot; explained the anti @-@ commission@@ er of Cec@@ ilia in the idea .
the Swe@@ din must include the proposal to mark the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the Free Trade Association .
the German government announced support .
the TT@@ IP is the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure will be applied in particular that the EU states and the USA will choose a new service passed on Justice in the EU .
they are supposed to come from the EU , the US , and third @-@ party countries .
a second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow them to raise the sentence .
so far , the rules of procedure and jurisdiction of the arbit@@ rators con@@ ferred , one obj@@ ection to their rights was not given .
in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in matters of Fair@@ ness and righteousness .
in the long term , they will bring to an International Investment District .
consequently , for example , disputes between Chinese and EU nations could also be clari@@ fied .
the arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) of the company &apos;s large corpor@@ ations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe with the TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration will be critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel operation , enabling the company to harm tax pay@@ ers , al@@ ti@@ bles such as national laws , or to cut a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act approved the proposal of the European Commission as an in@@ adequate one .
in particular , a free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) was considered to be criti@@ ci@@ zed .
the German economic plan Matthias Mach@@ in ( SPD ) states the plans by contrast , as great progress .
the Commission is licensed by the reform three points that &quot; Federal Minister for Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private operators is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Philip .
the European business association Bus@@ in@@ ess@@ Europe warned against the capabilities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be ad@@ ver@@ sely affected , since it declared .
when the discussions were concluded on the free trade agreement , the TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Research ) , on Wednesday further un@@ clear .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of invest@@ or protection was not discussed with the United States .
the agreement was originally planned to have been signed at the end of this year .
this appointment can not be kept longer .

apart from him , a fli@@ p@@ chart is located on which the main fol@@ ks@@ inger is recorded in the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with film record .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly caught by Stev@@ ens .
he tells of various places he will always report on the map in which they also arrange the songs arranged .
where they were born and like there it looks , in his native country .
since then Stev@@ ens shows up as a wonder@@ fully creative Ir@@ rer .
counting from the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake Geneva &quot; public@@ ally composed songs that tru@@ sts in harmon@@ ious way of American folk of the late six@@ ties , but all at all times make it great .
it is rum@@ oured , which Michigan , would be the first part of a allowed series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be evacu@@ ated .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven S@@ ans &quot; already appeared and had a positive aspect .
reduces le@@ vi@@ ens here on .
live meet him and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician will return to the series in New York .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens In@@ ites You To : Come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ator &quot; ) is a highly celebrated masterpiece .
welcoming on ideas and stylish fin@@ esse .
the album entered the U.S. Bill@@ board charts and was missing in no one of the most influ@@ ential music media in the list .
after a very productive experim@@ entation , Stev@@ ens then take part in &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , above extensive electronic parts .
this sixth regular studio album is still ongoing and orchest@@ rates , but carried out by programmed sequences or beats , and plays all the effects and sound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the smaller club got a long time , the stage shows talk to the colorful spect@@ acle of ne@@ on @-@ forehead and a huge fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens travel as part of a 5 @-@ member band .
in the dark red family More !
theatre presents itself mainly as &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; since March 2006 .
although almost 2000 guests have been banned in their chairs . Stev@@ ens returns back to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without post@@ ing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians through the broad@@ casts are played .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience one hears &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is possible to cast the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in the valley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only thanks to a addition , Stev@@ ens are very sensitive , they are acou@@ stically older than older songs and lay down on ro@@ aring appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ en made debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ en has been offering a lot of voltage at the Prime Minister &apos;s office since its election .
the new Labour Party lam@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n won his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and urged David Cameron to launch his debut .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n is lifted to sign up the first of its six given questions , shortly after noon , with most of which will probably be studied by the media and the Labour ME@@ P .
he sent &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p several meetings , to leave his colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary union for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because it comes to his appointment as a member of the shade cabinet office and according to his speech on the TU@@ C Annual Conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour government , initiated by Tuesday during the Sin@@ gen of the National Council during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , provoked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S , and is the focus of several title pages of the newspapers in the newspapers .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , don &apos;t attract the national an@@ them , has attention to him
a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respec@@ t@@ ful silence &quot; in the respec@@ t@@ ful silence , and he was recognised the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Air Force for England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , spoke in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he has advised the Labour government to sing the national hybrid , &quot; independent of its faith that the monarchy is abolished .
almost a dozen of the shadow of ministers refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they were called on Differ@@ ences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while fewer than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as leader .
the political editor of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t said that political differences are also shifted within the Labour &quot; foot@@ steps &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements in the position of the European Union and the limit of threads .
the M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n , the TU@@ C conference , that Labour &apos;s changes have to be presented , in order to remove all the idea of limitation .
hours later Mr Smith said , the shadow working and entrepren@@ eur that the Party is &quot; very clear &quot; is that it only was against the government plans to lower limit the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 2@@ 3.000 £ .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n is proposed to be the fifth Labour Chair , David Cameron speaking , ever since he faced T@@ ory chef , in the last decade over the B@@ isp@@ atch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour Party , which has promised another political focus on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron , and claimed more than 30,000 ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the parliamentary vote of the Prime Minister is subject to con@@ front@@ al , and that he will be made with resist@@ ors and instead rest@@ art@@ ed themselves on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the sha@@ ker of business ministers , is represented by Mr. Cameron , for example , if Mr. Cameron is not on the road .
he also brought the idea into a conversation , that other colleagues can occasionally take the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cy , the speaker of the House of House in order to discuss the problem .
when he was leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was linked to the politics under the style of a &quot; cas@@ per@@ le @-@ theater . &quot; but , a few years later he had been granted early teaching to have failed in it .
since she was broadcast@@ ed on TV first in 1990 , the parliamentary group tested the prime minister of the sentence of a leadership and his position in the sub @-@ house and his position on his parliam@@ ent@@ aries , although critics have had ar@@ gued , had become a car@@ ic@@ ile re@@ forms .

the city center of Johannesburg is a narrow place when you homeless .
however , a group of former street children has found a way to learn the fulness of life and to earn the living .
&quot; I guess which was shot in the ob@@ urg ( Un@@ - ) . &quot; I was a non @-@ profit studio that teaches the homeless people in it , how they get photos from their surroundings and generate a profit from it .

Peg@@ ida II is the sound of Lebanon &apos;s bass @-@ midrange driver
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it is both - and indeed in the potato sector , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger bra has developed Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the parable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato has set aside and meat on one sk@@ e@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea brought him a poster which is in the pe@@ ida @-@ demonstration of the title &quot; potatoes &quot; instead of D@@ öner against the title &quot; white potatoes . &quot;
since then , a grill gri@@ ddle , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is a multi@@ cultural heritage for the stomach , &quot; expressed pur@@ g@@ y .
in keeping with the idea of Lebanon , the idea of Lebanon has taken down a position .
there , they are only protected as a utility patent according to the authority .
like much flesh and how much potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ wers , Al@@ ha@@ y wants to betra@@ y anybody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tast@@ es together even better , &quot; &quot; &quot;
also for its customers , the culinary understanding of international understanding is well doing well .
met@@ cash starts the in@@ comprehen@@ sion campaign against the control of algae -
met@@ ic is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di &apos;s stand in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ Groß@@ er Met@@ ronic has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the share of IG@@ A retail@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing two sales offices and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ a@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets provide connection with local food suppliers and marketing the IG@@ A brand with mainst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing on the social media , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A retail@@ er and suppliers spend on board , with brands such as ice manufacturers Sim@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who sell @-@ selling tickets for the South Australian Football League at 2015 for faithful customers .
it is expected that the cash cash released further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when wholes@@ al@@ ers carry down food , alcohol and devices through its annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states .
pro@@ cu@@ rement and IG@@ A retail@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land , Australia - more than 30 percent in South Australia , as well as 24 per cent in Western Australia , compared to roughly 14 per cent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts look like Morgan Stanley , where ever , Al@@ di gave about five percent of the food market across these two states over the opening of its first markets , and all the existing actors , but mainly self @-@ employed retail@@ ers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IG@@ A retail@@ ers could lose 360 million revenue per year and earned 250 millions $ by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million will be achieved in each market .
the loss in the Food and grocery store and at the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s with a high fixed cost base could cost $ $ 13 million pre @-@ tax profits before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , the cash market share loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently run survey of Roy &apos;s Morgan stressed that IG@@ A @-@ hosted buyers are the most known .
Morgan Stanley assumed that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover generated by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2017 , and to reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading bank manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , ran at a business dinner in Melbourne that is probably to play in the decade .
met@@ cash rejected it starting to react to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a manager of the board has got in touch with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income derived from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has fallen by about 43 percent since 2012 , which reflect the operational debt reduction by simultaneous pressure in net sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the dealer turns out and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ in order to improve sales prices with col@@ es and vo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products per week and to improve their shops through faster @-@ growing fresh food and supply a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop rehabilitation programmes can be con@@ sign@@ alized and hopes that the major retail@@ er in 2017 will return to profit growth for the first time in four years .
Than@@ ks Ma@@ im@@ an@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis hall Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ k@@ co@@ al@@ ak@@ is earns rather praise than criticism for his behavior .
Than@@ i Cha@@ ko@@ boy was one of the &quot; Coll@@ ateral Damage in the recent storm by his friend Nick C@@ yri@@ a and settled in view of the president of the Australian tennis board Steve Heal@@ y wrote more praise than criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os that is repeatedly named as &quot; Special KS , &quot; was placed by the not@@ orious debate of C@@ yri@@ a with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters into the spot@@ light .
in a fe@@ ather @-@ qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon after that co@@ ach@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison were to be separated from the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to hit me , and I would strike the child . &quot;
while he saw a tennis ra@@ cket , as he had a tennis ra@@ cket once a cr@@ amp has led a potential US Open victory of Richard di@@ quet , was defended by Heal@@ y &apos;s Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , play with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in a single @-@ ranking for Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals .
&quot; one thing that I en@@ vious at my opinion is the fact that , after my view Than@@ ks was a little dra@@ fted in the dispute , &quot; Heal@@ y said .
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost his campaign in the US Open , but he is not the first player that has left a bat of Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ ks good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , indeed , he has extremely well in the US Open , even below the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around itself , he has a great family around itself , and I believe that he was a little too strictly treated .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he &apos;s never trained with the other players , he is trained hard , it &apos;s well in shape . it is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe it deserves it to be judged according to his own services .
Heal@@ y supported the decision by taking into consideration the upcoming decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right to all , but he sec@@ ures the man of Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term strength of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is entirely focused on the competition , and not all about the contro@@ vers@@ y &#91; C@@ yri@@ a &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe we have made Nick very quickly to ascend , but he has made a few aw@@ ful mistakes , and he didn &apos;t make all the criticism that he can think about it . some time outside the ramp , in which he can think about it , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains the border , which keeps the border , fu@@ elled to refugees
Hungary explains the emergency call and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , taking them all firmly to get caught into the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos was followed by the border , as hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in an Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and to the Serbian civil servants with indignation .
the people who had fled from violence , set in a country strip on the street between the two main points of the lands and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ ity got it .
when a police helicopter above them emer@@ ges , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried to ins@@ ults Against the Hungarian prop@@ aganda .
some refers to food@@ stuffs and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Ministry announced that migrants would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants coming from Hungary to come back from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be convers@@ ations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il on the Hungarian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block in Brussels , with an disputed meeting in Brussels , no common foreign monetary policy .
the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who , in excess of Italy and Greece , sought their hope that , in the next month or until the end of the year , the EU Member States would be able to receive another 120,000 refugees , including several from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration base of the continent .
however , Hungary , however , won &apos;t its hopes on a troubled action of Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency number that was declared on Tuesday , in two Southern regions , authorities caused more powers to aband@@ on the crisis , so that it would un@@ lock public roads , and to accelerate its asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country was preparing the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence across the border to Romania - to stop the influ@@ x of migrants across the land - after it has brought a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Dental D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata stated that his jail started during the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence annex@@ es between Hungary and Serbia were to be put in place .
over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant way for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and an investment point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has passed that most of the upcoming economic refugees are , looking for a better life , and not by war @-@ fle@@ ets that are entitled to protection - a view that lies heavily in the contra@@ diction among other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which came into force around midnight in Hungary , do the cross the border , or the dam@@ aging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high gate to den@@ d@@ ze the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put mit@@ es pen@@ alties for the human traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; due to the situation created on migration migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ ac Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very plain@@ ly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament is to extend the application to the military yet to vote for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have seen at the border to heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Pay@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities made 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were already lowered into the country .
they come from , by lowering the fence , they are now in custody to undergo interro@@ gation by off@@ ense according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
in the morning , Hungarian officials joined the seven fron@@ tier town with Serbia , after a train was equipped with bar@@ bed wire to close the fron@@ ti@@ ers , arrived .
chaos linked the main border crossing at Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to handle data from people and pressed a crowd , in order to push them down there .
approximately 20 succeeded in being entered but thousands remained .
a further group of migrants found the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would be nour@@ ishing to nour@@ ish food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead was hal@@ ved before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders to national pol@@ l
the former U.S. Minister of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic state to nom@@ ination on national level , and Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins on the ground .
Clinton has now backed the support of 47 per cent of democratic voters during the local elections ( 58 % in the previous year ) , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice pre@@ sidents Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet , announced his presidential candidate to support his presidential election of 15 per cent of the democratic voters .
more than five months prior to the start of the election , most democratic voters think that it is too early to say that their belief st@@ ems , the candidate they will support them .
but Clin@@ t &apos;s Supp@@ or@@ ters are more consistent with the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups which generated a number of wins .
Clinton holds a wide margin of women and of mixtures , but these origins have been reduced .
their support for the men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is now only with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s benefit for democratic voters aged under 50 has pl@@ ough@@ ed and so on , and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton has a big advantage with the older voters .
in the past month , Clinton was with a double @-@ digit advance with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders is now a 5 @-@ point advantage with this group .
approximately half of the democratic voters &quot; voters &quot; took off in the country that they were willing to support him when they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support her with some hold , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidates .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clin@@ t &apos;s latest Supp@@ or@@ ters are all inspired by her .
the views are stronger , in those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of the election of democratic voters said Washington had created Clinton to fire , saying less Republi@@ can voters leads this over their leading candidate of Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , the most common answer is that she now has the right experience ( 16 per cent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidates for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supp@@ orter worldwide her connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) has been mentioned .
consent for use with the problems and the dial should also be quoted .
as the Vice @-@ President pre@@ aches a potential for the Presi@@ dential Office into the Wa@@ ag@@ ings , 57 percent of the democratic voters will look for him in the race - even though a third has believed that he was not going to do it .
for the democratic voters is asked to vote for their second election , the vote for the party is Bi@@ den at top .
from Clinton &apos;s followers more than half , that Bi@@ den would have been so different from being different .
decide if it decides , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead will rise to S@@ anders , starting from 20 points with jum@@ ped in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters will see the candidate in favour of winning choice but dropped by 78 per cent in the last month .
it is in a second with a gap in this measurement , but the percentage that is visible as the &quot; selected bu@@ sts &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , during the question of which a candidate is more important , members of voters call the elec@@ torate .
similarly as in the last month we have not the only Democratic candidate or a potential candidate for these voters &quot; un@@ acceptable the un@@ acceptable candidate .
the Democratic candidate , or any potential candidate do good results with some important tra@@ its in the election of the party .
added to Clinton &apos;s sake , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ography as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong guide quality .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts him best from hon@@ est@@ y , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that beyond S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
the democratic elec@@ torate of the elections are commonly attributed to Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den , in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions relating to Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use a personal e @-@ mail address and a server in office as a Secretary of State , most of the Democratic voters pre@@ lu@@ de with their declaration of the matter and saying that their opinions did not affect their opinions .
but it is a different story in the US public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans is now un@@ satisfied with their declaration while only about one @-@ third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion is wor@@ sen@@ ed by her .
there are mostly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton became worse in Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this will continue to be a problem for them among registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote is not for honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the elec@@ torate is widespread nationwide and not rather tru@@ st@@ worthy and non @-@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes for gui@@ ding .
by the six out @-@ tested candidates , Bi@@ ds , Car@@ son and Bush , cut best in hon@@ est@@ y .
a majority looks to S@@ anders rather than honest , but like Car@@ son many do not have opinions of him .
the response rate for the sample from 351 the German voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son came back to Donald Tr@@ ump , near the USA .
Ben Car@@ son is situated in the latest survey by C@@ BS news / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the turn@@ out candidates take off the support of voters in the new survey and others are losing up .
Republi@@ can voters only support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . supporting the support of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted most of the Fox News debate in a survey by 27 % in pol@@ l .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey revealed that car@@ son began well in demo@@ graphic groups and was sur@@ passed by Tr@@ ump at university education .
the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , Governor John Ka@@ himself , is beaten with the Wis@@ con@@ sins , Scott Walker , who has fallen today by 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio stand up at 6 % in the third position .
the les@@ ions of 376 individuals led by members of the Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey was Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises to the pol@@ ls - lan@@ ces with 19 % support for Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the most recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post now showed Tr@@ ump again before Car@@ son .
in 2001 , with a look at one of the last week before Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some page names for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after car@@ son dis@@ gu@@ essed him to question the tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign of performance in I@@ owa .

five . the Brotherhood &apos;s death , with the death of a Bar@@ uch College or Ne@@ ul@@ ings
for almost two years , after a student during a pi@@ ous rit@@ ual with a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ship trials were filed against five people .
the members of the New York Bar@@ uch : P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Cou@@ pon was brut@@ ally attacked and en@@ forced his transport in the hospital , which contributed to his death in September 2013 , following his death in September 2013 .
officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly led to attack across a frozen field on a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about heada@@ che , then it fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood not called the emergency number 911 immediately after Den@@ g was filled and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , the symptoms of goo@@ s and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the National President of the Brotherhood to seek advice , &quot; said Police Director Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the Brotherhood began to store and viol@@ ate the achievement of the Brotherhood , concerning Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Director Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and in the next morning he died of his injuries .
following a aut@@ op@@ sy project , Den@@ g has been repeatedly given with p@@ umping strength to the head , the body and the upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; for many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student has , since 1970 , on the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; says Douglas F@@ ier@@ e@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ i family , represents a statement .
bro@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs and their members need to be comp@@ elled to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury named an indictment due to Mor@@ des Third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of a pun@@ ch@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to take part in the involved person , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - this , we will also move these to the account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College is not allowed to force the Brotherhood and the national bro@@ therhood is rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed rises up interest
a t@@ ine @-@ rate does , and the cr@@ ates will come into the che@@ eks , re@@ fin@@ ite for bonds , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long will it take , and how long will it stop .
in particular , the story of the economy will only offer low guide .
a recession was disp@@ at@@ ched within 11 months of the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggression from the Federal Reserve at a rise of interest rates is often , even not always a factor which changes the economy and the financial systems .
thus representatives of the US Central Bank have emphas@@ ised so strongly that investors should not concentrate on them when it begins to increase the interest rates , rather than the period that will be needed for normal@@ ization .
in fact , multiple variables will play a role .
at the end , market participants could determine that all the excitement was driven rather far due to a interest rate .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap schol@@ ars &apos; era , &quot; said Julian hy@@ s@@ sop , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to ordinary high@@ s , but still at low level to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear for many .
however , this does not mean that there will be any effect on it .
here is an important historical location , based on some areas of the economy could react to :
as seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate can make things for a while .
as soon as the increase yields , the impact wouldn &apos;t be so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a trend that wealth income is compens@@ ated for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts at a recent study on what will interest after interest in the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market has mostly seen in the trend during the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike , then back to normal weather after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis that Bob D@@ oll , chief system Strat@@ tos at Nu@@ bian Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the German Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to increase in increases in increases . the rate of return begins to decrease .
revi@@ e@@ ons are a matter of economic life , but interest rate increases often .
in the current case the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with a few terms that did not exist before and which could accelerate the recession .
extremely interesting is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a higher interest rate at the F@@ ed .
according to German bank , the 118 Zin@@ cav@@ ities had fallen just twice to the nominal GDP at 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although in the second quarter of 2015 at 3.6 percent , just a few expected that this will last and expect just 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zin@@ c increases with a fra@@ ct@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and pro@@ strate the question , &quot; whether this is different &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken the whole year to a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could agree to an increase in their meeting , the FO@@ MC delivers an average probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all real cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing the disappearance and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ essi@@ on@@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it carried the recovery rapidly after the start of recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is clearly a very slow recovery of what the worst recession in the observed period was .
the current cycle is by far the longest ever since the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the recession , the record was 35 months and this is now 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ at@@ ile because the market takes a interest rate because the model varies quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that if the effect of bonds are faster than shares , if their strategic transactions will change .
on bonds , the R@@ end@@ ites seem to change direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle is done .
at the end of the increases cycle , the candidates are falling immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists from Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in increasing rates between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fla@@ ir of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still able to expect higher revenues , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ ine , in an analysis .
it thinks that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation , there are a number of signs that the market has adjusted to prosp@@ ect in str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot;
short interest rates increased , the amount of income is flat , l@@ ending condition is expanded , and the Vol@@ at@@ ility has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and all the companies , which are t@@ opped the larger part of their business activities in the United States , will benefit from the increase in interest rates and the local products are more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as a firm increases their products on the global market , and equally benefits their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares are likely to do very positi@@ vely , three months after an initial rate hike , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s told us in a report for customers . &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed by a five percentage points after each of the Zin@@ c increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital rates and lower volumes in their shares outstanding also their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a big problem .
the company , with its high share of flexible interest , will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure shares , consumers will also benefit from the rising fee .
as@@ par@@ ag@@ us might see gains by higher revenues , even if experts have different opinions , as fast as this is going to take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says member of the member Andrew B@@ ingham
the Parliament became a member of the Parliament about the station due to his &quot; exter@@ ity . &quot;
he ar@@ gued that he is not differenti@@ ated between commercial li@@ pos@@ es .
he has also performed music awards at the BBC Music Awards and said that they &apos;ve been only the Br@@ its !
Parliament @-@ Colle@@ ge Dam@@ ien Collins , the program The Voice , and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 , &quot; to Classic FM , claims to be a leader member of the member and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something to do the private station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative ME@@ D B@@ ingham was also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suspected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suspected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is to be distinguished by its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ gest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems to be converted to Classic FM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also appe@@ aled to the BBC Music Awards , which started in December .
the BBC Music Awards , that began last year , seems to be the Br@@ its only under another name .
so , if you are trying to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneous examples of which you are actually only to quote what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director proved the alle@@ g@@ ations back and ar@@ gu@@ ing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors , when the general debates about live music and En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment goes to the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I don &apos;t learn to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really in@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , new music to find and new works , I think also really for important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller is against Alan Dav@@ ey , that he had to work with the audience to engage in the audience as it works in the past , because the British are more of classical music .
radio 3 has not been the only element of the BBC Production , which , while the hearing in the Committee on S@@ election of Culture , Media and Sport came under fire , making commercial li@@ pos@@ es on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ Chamber Dam@@ ien Review , The Voice to - the musical talent at the BBC , which has been bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is in@@ ward and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Palm of Faith and Boy George as a Judge - was produced by the special BBC fashion .
he added , he wishes that the company inv@@ ent a hit in our own barn , &quot; if the next time it was a keeping of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from other rows of The Voice in the future , or to issue money of charge generators for other enter@@ taining formats .
Internet revenue increased significantly in August in the slow@@ est , and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago through the use of cell@@ phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday threshold of November has been hin@@ dered in November
for over a decade the virtual machine is bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets are transformed into gh@@ ost cities .
but experts say that there is evidence of the online sales to stag@@ n@@ ate after new numbers were just seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase over the previous year .
experts say that there were signs that online sales have stag@@ n@@ ated after new numbers increased only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and back up to 2000 , then , in the course of the time , &quot; Andy B@@ c@@ ah@@ y , a publisher of the IM@@ RG &apos;s sale complex came to the Guardian . &quot;
he stated that the online sales had increased more than three years ago when a buyer began to take their mobile phones .
it imp@@ lied that more people could buy online and that people could do it in various environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this com@@ close up , and we may see that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the first revenues .
experts believe that for its purchases , the buyer has held its purchases on Friday , November last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers , in order to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites launched .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyer fought for bar@@ gains , buyers could stop of it alone .
a British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium was out that a total of £ 5 issues were sold at a cost of £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases must be made using Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people &apos;s clothing and shoes are buying online instead of the mo@@ ons in the inner cities .

today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden &apos;s arm had not been the arm of the crane , as he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree , which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency in 2013 , said that the Bin Laden group is responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency didn &apos;t report this detail , however , said that the leaders of the business abroad must not be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man started to reveal what the overthrow of the crane that was immersed in a courtyard of the mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to the H@@ add@@ ose who were assembled in this month .

inspired by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chef @-@ correspon@@ dent for the Daily Mail
it will asser@@ ted that Britain hit its h@@ ammers and Br@@ ush in favour of the deployment of qualified host@@ els that carry out the work in their home .
if you are sent to a hammer or a brush to Anst@@ amm @-@ around walls , you nowadays belong to a minority .
for the British , they are increasingly professional nurs@@ ing home @-@ doing jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Baum@@ gart@@ ner chain , he said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , the services offered to deep prices have now over@@ hau@@ led .

Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our offices .
we must make this stronger to balance .
generally half of our customers consists of 80 percent of all decisions made by the purchase of articles and women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .

function@@ aries of a@@ I / D@@ ob due to un@@ faithfulness before Court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian judge runner a@@ I / D@@ ob has to answer for lack of personal and spending money .
the def@@ endants are not found guilty .
one of them was also charged for ministers .
now he was released legally by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ os , the accused were rec@@ las@@ h@@ ed in the term 2006 to 2011 funds of association presses , which were allowed to disp@@ ose upon their functions , used for private purposes .
the costs shall be dam@@ aging with approximately 400.000 euros .
the sports facilities are charged also for financial purposes .
the Fak@@ acy was the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ er seat , judge Micha@@ ela S@@ in , out .
it should be negotiated an later date .
the aband@@ on@@ ment of the un@@ faithful den@@ ounced the defense that the association was created at no time the title of the year .
the sports facilities had calculated only flow @-@ damages and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and spent much time and money , derived from debt - the liabilities were carried out by approximately 600.000 p@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we continue the club , or cur@@ led us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; telling him of the accused , a chief aud@@ itor of the financial law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his co @-@ accused and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; we met money , our living insur@@ ances as security were laid down in the Bank , &quot; he said during the participation .
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely ; there are only no debts to be made .
in addition - with the corresponding financial success , the payout progress of the damages shall be imposed until 1991 .
therefore , there have been a part of the claim damages only years later , namely , from the year 2003 when an increase has been on the account .
the flat and non @-@ det@@ ach@@ ments thus seemed to explain the former representative of the former representative .
the accounts and trade books administered the two accused together , said the second accused .
why the out@@ flow on the association was not yet tra@@ cted in detail , the judge asked .
the association was not interested in detail for financial assistance , it &apos;s important to school freedom , that &apos;s the answer .
in 2011 , as against the senior official investigations due to official use , an amount of € 120,000 had been handed over to the association .
these wor@@ shipping have been , the def@@ endants .
this state in securities entered the name of the second accused and was not known , according to the under@@ statement of the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; she wanted to know the judge .
ther@@ wise , the court listened to a very good answer .
at that moment , he said that he was the best one for the club .
when something happened to him , no one would have known anything of this money , the prosecutor in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants were informed of that they are the function@@ ary of the function .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim of damage . &quot;
why claims relating ? , Judge and Prosecutor want to know .
this became the first of the accused , which he had not accepted this formulation , because the society was never created a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of you from the tail@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am an employee representative ? &quot; he asked him .
he also said the teacher , he has never engaged a p@@ enny salary , he only counted per@@ o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
having co@@ aching F@@ AD , he b@@ illed 1,000 euros per month to pay the actual effort , but he added much higher costs .
the accused were not able to provide precise documents for the early years .
these be , after an aud@@ iting , in which all was judged correctly , no more stored , they declared .

time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency bench
the world is observed in the US emergency bench of two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision whether for the first time since nearly a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were surveyed by Reuters , found a little more than half the last week of view that the F@@ ed will continue to wait any longer and the interest rates are to be kept at the present level of 0 - 0.25 percent .
it &apos;s an historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest in NU@@ LL .
for the first time we come to a situation where a large central bank would leave the zero area and enter@@ tain a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ ber , Head of Emplo@@ ye@@ es at Peter@@ son &apos;s Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is based on a relatively good performance , tr@@ illi@@ ons of dollars will be added to the balance and generate only a low level of inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy view of the world .
she warned the markets to set itself to an increase , but the signs point to the fact that the chances are against such a one .
the final decision should be made at 8 pm CET on Thursday
death toll of Delta State University
after the shoot and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before he got out and killed his colleagues later - Sh@@ annon Lamb is just a note to say that he appe@@ aled to him , &quot; when he appe@@ aled to him , &quot; he could not do it in@@ complete , &quot; announced by authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , teacher for Ge@@ ography and Social scientific Education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , I was shot on someone , and one killed him .
later told the employee of the emergency call , that the police have sent polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the house but nobody becomes anno@@ ying , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police were asked by the call@@ ers of his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
Not@@ ice has no explanation for its shots .
as the police ra@@ ced the scene , they discovered the body of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten notes of Lamb , 45 , the said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I just wanted to reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman who loved me . &quot;
after the writing of a note 16@@ 300 miles from the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally took his own life on Monday night as polic@@ emen and en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
Vienna @-@ President of William La@@ For@@ ge said that he doesn &apos;t know anything from the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ as presentation . &quot;
in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb didn &apos;t believe that Pr@@ un@@ en also served with Schmidt with a relationship , they said &quot; no information , &quot; no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triple business relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ ition was j@@ ured by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , which in which she had been married for about seven years , than a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained familiar .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ab@@ bas had destroyed a daughter being 19 , and it was &quot; destroyed &quot; at the floor . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ab@@ iss have their daughter , &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
pris@@ ion@@ ically worked online from home , according to tradition of Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , which was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ab@@ bu@@ cks , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , has been met for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb which was rec@@ alled by some time on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when they struck him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , later in this night , the car came to run on foot , fled by foot , running into the woods and killed oneself with a shot .
finally , in the spring of 2015 , the Delta State University gave a Do@@ ct@@ orate in his life on the university &apos;s website .

Euro 10 : Lufthansa raises the consolidated revenue
the Lufthansa is planning a big group of interest .
as a year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save a half billion euros in a better organization alone .
150 of the approximately 1000 exec@@ utives around the world will cost professional working to the workplace .
by pilot production it is in@@ the new negotiations .
the German company extends its business structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ fare € wings .
the goal of the new real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of around € 500 million per ann@@ um in cost and generating annual syner@@ gies , was the airline on Wednesday .
amongst other things , there will be no board for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ wage aircraft for cheap customers should be developed as separate as possible .
in his new Executive Board , Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , has been responsible for sale by Karl Ulrich retail@@ er for euro wings .
in the future , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of a swing , that the Group will want to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet at the time of its establishment .
so far , the organisation of the 120 000 associates was complex .
the airline company operates under the demand of the Passage Group , which represents an annual turnover of about 30 billion euros .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has not allowed many months for months of need
Luke Sha@@ w suffered double fra@@ cture of his right B@@ one at the Champions League team from Manchester at the same time .
while this is the left def@@ ending player , Louis van Ga@@ al decided not to play the hope for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al cannot play the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the les@@ ho@@ oting was caused by a down@@ fall attack by H@@ é@@ vi@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field , and needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a dual chain structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will move tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a young who comes with 18 to Manchester United which is very hard and then goes fantastic , and then it happens .
he had a oxygen @-@ mask on the locker room .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno felt happy , with a red card and a hanging of a place prize .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , did not off@@ ender the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al believed that the Italian arbit@@ rator had gone wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a m@@ meter and a red card was due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can not describe how broken I &apos;m , my way to the recovery begins now , I &apos;m coming back again &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be occupied : Manchester United has resulted in loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat .
but the European Union has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover from the European Championship in France up to the coming June .
Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very stor@@ my violation . &quot;
when a player leaves that kind of pla@@ ge the place , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of going to viol@@ ate any opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg breakthrough , as Mexico as Van Ga@@ as Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that there is a very worst case , that is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who was in another direction on the road , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels like hard to be like something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very po@@ or@@ ly in it . I &apos;m sorry about it .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ č@@ nik was also brought to the hospital - a match of Chris Sm@@ ales .
surely David Cameron wants to know The Lor@@ ax ?
it &apos;s a thing to get to all parents : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it .
unless you &apos;re there , David Cameron is Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , the favourite children &apos;s register was asked to call the minister &apos;s Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron said in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , creative , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book which I like to read my children , since it always seems a picture or a message that we have passed up so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except for the following paragraph , in which capitalism quoted the preliminary version of the book , instead of adding a sum of the 2012 film version , adding the new characters and details to enlarge the quite short original text .
in the middle of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ine @-@ Ville , where all the nature is gone and even the air went to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , it reads , &quot; a love of love was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name , Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ el and who died in 1991 , was completely unknown .
as if that was not yet enough : the text of Cameron al@@ ien@@ ated as follows : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a cargo , hopes a young called T@@ ed to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although He seems to be a pra@@ g@@ matic Father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron is speaking with a little like the local environment , like the local environment because of its protests , Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , sn@@ u@@ ff character , &quot; that is devast@@ ated in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ating to the deleg@@ ate , who the Lor@@ ax had not read 20 times in a row a child .
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street writer said that the text had probably been bought by Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s bal@@ lot .
Super camps 2013 confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons was delivered , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was very clear from the expulsion from England &apos;s team , but this is still difficult .
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates are a difficult task , but if you chose the carc@@ ass of the UK for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series did not match on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air Coo@@ ke site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars from 2012 , but only an it@@ ably positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een is now being developed as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid himself when he represents an unknown size in the test @-@ plane , is an option to attack .
here , the information said : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from England &apos;s test @-@ pool and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course it is difficult to note as his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
during its seven tests , there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , but the simple but hard reality is that thr@@ illers are ge@@ ared to end results .
there was no question mark following Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I have said this before - players are their very best choice .
a long time ago , we had extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had the control of his own dest@@ iny .
if you hop@@ efully hits additional lots for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance .
the UK @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lo@@ iss asked its post@@ ure even if he didn &apos;t bring good performance , and it surprised me not ; it is mainly a team guy .
the question how much time will get a test b@@ ats@@ man to set his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th won seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son received him in front of him while Nick Com@@ p@@ itz lasted nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on received the chance to do home and down@@ wards .
the only off@@ scour@@ ge , which one can raise , was that England first depos@@ ite Jonathan p@@ ite in the Caribbean , but the lost chance is now in the past , but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales come in , and he is a drummer , which I high .
he is a X @-@ factor blo@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we seen in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season , viewed by 236 votes to joining us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square .
he must have received at least the same opportunities as they received before him , but of course it depends on the cross @-@ place in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , next to cook , cook in addition to cook something which could give an extra spin @-@ out Bow@@ ker and four Qu@@ icks , I di@@ pped , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer there can &apos;t strike , and this left @-@ hand has shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket tree .
Mo@@ een might have a job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is no number 3 for her , and there is no significant difference .
my former Team col@@ li@@ er Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as Op@@ ti@@ ff in 2001 .
he has made three hundred inst@@ ants , and looked not .
Z@@ afar Shi@@ a comes in the Ka@@ j@@ as back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner , and in my limited use of him he is very impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pl@@ unt , but there is no huge number of backup sp@@ inning those who lift their hands and the trainer have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has a few smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ ten@@ ds , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , became a consultant for the trial , could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the ni@@ c@@ est not@@ ices of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere of the tour and puts energy and a powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela has created insight , from where we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the locker room fresh air , even when the news in line with the previously predicted .
collaboration team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Keep away a similar pause of Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team@@ work determine not the schedule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must remember that in the case of the gam@@ ers , their jobs will depend on the results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not taken in their own heart .

foreigners also have their ru@@ st@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .

we could also call this to Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .

Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally con@@ federation , but it has been on power for 10 years , before it looks badly for them , as it has been done under the over@@ power@@ ing years such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande is looking right on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a mis@@ leading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist political government , Spain .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are carried out a lim@@ b to help the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Brit@@ ons who are to get used in order to prevent the withdrawal from the UK , Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies did .
hence , some such ministers must not plan and see clearly useful notes , altogether included in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s related report campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ ite process , probably my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re @-@ negoti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the re @-@ start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

actually , Tony Bla@@ ir died similarly to them , but provided that if one sits on a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , one is better distributed anas in order to dist@@ ra@@ ct him instead of spending his lunch and dinner .

experts critic@@ ise the report about the Public Health England above E @-@ cigarettes
alle@@ g@@ ations of a state @-@ financed agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking formed from a 12 @-@ person meeting , in part with connections to tobacco industry , they told .

P@@ he published the &quot; basic report &quot; in the past month , and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have put the ability to demand the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the Lanc@@ et magazine Lanc@@ et last month , which was awarded the &quot; extraordinary eman@@ cip@@ ation , &quot; was founded upon the pick his most important conclusion .
two further researchers in the BM@@ J and have asked whether the asser@@ tions &quot; can build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public L@@ ights at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
you said that the study is expecting the fact that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria statistical analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Act Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ves products ; the results of the meeting were group@@ ed into a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , the managing director had previously received an independent study previously by the British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) .
he also signed the BA@@ T website for public health in a sustainability report , also published it .
one of the 12 participants explained to the meeting financed by a E @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing which he report@@ edly have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International to make it added .
the reasons for the selection of members of the committee will not be delivered , but also includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes , some of which also add some industries to finance the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the session we took part in the tobacco under of P@@ he .
the research work of the Group &apos; means a significant aim , &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no such links or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the asser@@ tions of P@@ he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no evidence whatsoever we serve as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said , said that BM@@ J &apos;s asser@@ tions had been re@@ acted before .
as he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are considerably less dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ong smo@@ kers die in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of E cigarettes are low in comparison to this , but we still continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique obligation to information about the public via what is proof and does not , especially if there are so much public confusion about the relative thre@@ ats compared with tobacco .
almost 80,000 people are dying per year in a disease with a view of smoking , and smoking will cost two billion Swiss National Health costs annually .
through the clear adv@@ ances of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking caused by smoking , we fulfill our national competence .
BBC should not give up East@@ er@@ ders , a former CEO of Channel 4
the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should cease to send programs like arrow En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial @-@ over @-@ shows would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio work could only be used to manage the type of programs that will not be broadcast@@ ed by other UK radio stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are publicly supported by a smaller audience , which probably saw from a smaller audience , in a hard controversial time window against the most popular shows of their rival and transmitters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ Director General , Tony Hall , he said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson reported that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC program gives or broadcast that programmes would also be proven by non @-@ subsi@@ dised regime , &quot; said Johnson re@@ worked on the BBC &apos;s top @-@ office Committee in the context of his investigation .
if you would like to keep the radio fee , which I do not mean in the middle or long term , you should at least to do its production at least for programs that do not do or by order .
they send the Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ y tax programs financed it could be financed without subsidi@@ zation .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ du@@ it is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , others would give their right arm in it .
I try to see myself how this publicly appears on a public television .
I don &apos;t believe that the BBC were at all speed .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for serial production , conducted the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC bl@@ ame on the hunt for the pursu@@ it , &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular programmes of the BBC will do this again , which was the former head of the Sky , Tony Ball , which was sold in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart at the Edinburgh in 2003 , so that the BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ commercial non @-@ profit programs &quot; on BB@@ C4 must go , but they are working to their tasks , and they can argue when , in their apparent missions to just@@ ify $ 4 billion . &quot; now , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they lay them into a window , in which nobody wanted to see them at any time .
for the radio fee , Johnson reported to the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more governing system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course , all of us remember that one gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who for the £ 150 is a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they did not consume much of the BBC .
the former sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also den@@ ounced the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ th@@ ian @-@ Mission , to train and to enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only a few of the BBC were now officially classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and this should be said to have some of the public @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to issue the partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the &apos; pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are being shown , and with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances , to make everything online .
- Son@@ e@@ Gen@@ etics &apos;s can control brain cells via sound waves
this video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes are moving towards the moment in which they are bra@@ ying with sound movements .
scientists have far@@ med wor@@ ms with gen@@ etically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes are changing in a moment when they want sound con@@ vol@@ ets that are to be heard for the human hearing at high frequencies , they have to be heard .
the impul@@ ses work through the switch of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gen@@ etically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels , which react to ultr@@ as@@ ound .
further on this subject : researchers read and write the brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ e@@ Gen@@ etics , where an ultr@@ asonic procedure may be used to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ovascular and muscle cells outside of the body .
Or@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of Hir@@ n@@ stim@@ ulation with an inv@@ a@@ sive procedure that gives electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
we do not react to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Hal@@ as@@ ani reported that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bubbles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ as@@ ound , that enters into wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ ound waves point upon structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ten@@ ds and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the ages .
sound waves effect the opening of these ion@@ als channels and activ@@ ating the cells , those they are assigned to , such a Report the nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ asonic controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , T@@ āl@@ u gen@@ etically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their m@@ ons tr@@ ons will wear TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
while as@@ ound in ultr@@ as@@ ound circles , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by micro@@ waves and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they activate the modified motors in mot@@ ion@@ less .
the procedure has a simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scientist allows , changing ne@@ ural with impul@@ ses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ e@@ Gen@@ etics could have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , that must be sent down on a optical fiber to the required position in the brain , a low frequencies of ultr@@ asonic tissue can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
... &quot; we believe that with therapy and a therapeutic virus , the Cel@@ tic cells are temporarily vulner@@ able to the ultr@@ as@@ ound detector in a clinical response to certain neuro@@ logical outcomes , &quot; said CH@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , &quot; he added .

eight golden rules for living in the student residence
11 years ago , I moved to a student residence in a residence hall , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the cl@@ utter@@ ed smile of those who I have offended , and to the numerous , long @-@ affected appe@@ als over others .
this is what I have learned , can be distilled in eight simple rules .
the adv@@ ent in student halls reaches out of slightly nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it is s@@ cur@@ ly to sm@@ ashing : people say where you come from a Sabbath year , where you do not love the Sabbath year , and why you really hate Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love , because in the Ernst , guys , it &apos;s only a He@@ fe@@ eder &apos;s ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe out through .
and help others to do the same - make questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to figure out the people in contrast to those you would not speak if your eyel@@ ids were burned in fire , and these extingu@@ ishers of fire .
let people react .
people of people often change into drinks , film @-@ night venues and public meetings , but they are also the places where people wear and push their under@@ wear .
about referring to : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted a great treatment at the university .
their room should have a refuge , but many student halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ ble@@ @-@ culture , which is friendly and social , and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing of culture does not allow you to say : &quot; I like you and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away so that I go back the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ian approach is exhau@@ sted by soci@@ al@@ izing , and send an SMS to it .
talking about A@@ pro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my students residence hall had the idea that an un@@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close relatives by che@@ ek .
as you begin the university on the cli@@ max of the Back @-@ mania , the pel@@ ines is made with a plate of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s . welcome in the neighborhood , I just build you something . so , and now please smile when I welcome you some personal questions .
homemade s@@ wer@@ ies is a good way to close friends .
her roomm@@ ates are required to maintain itself . and , at the end , your face will be associated with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly done co@@ ats of flour , sugar and gre@@ ase lead to the fact that people get asleep again when you get out .
food to steal , is an essential crime in student residence people .
naturally , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but it is not taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the dairy owner .
chances are , that they say even to operate even if they cook in the house .
if someone hit your stuff , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion , but try to be more balanced when my fellow @-@ inhabit@@ ant , who added the milk a dish@@ on@@ ur@@ ant to cruci@@ fy th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , the people from sleep , or from the work .
it is not only about to be an decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the prover@@ b that you belong to the people who are sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my cor@@ rid@@ ors asked her neighbors , whether he makes them a little qui@@ eter to leave Dr@@ um &amp; bass is qui@@ eter when there are three o &apos;clock in the morning , and in the morning she had a test .
they responded on it with a loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 a.m. , she had kindly requested two hours to sleep before she closed her own music , closed her door and went on to her three @-@ hour test .
would it be surprising if your future sp@@ ouse would happen to enter the same student residence at the same time ?
it would not be absur@@ d about it , if you set a co @-@ resident partners for your future music partnership , they need to separate themselves and then you &apos;ll have to see each day and may experience , how to over@@ pass them all together ?
of course , the heart walks his own way - but if a hot co @-@ inhabit@@ ant is definitely not your future sexual partner is , try at least to speak a bit of mind .
in the exciting moment in which you must point that someone can lie their keys in its not closed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing fine , than it seems .
a good laugh is funny but it only takes moments , until he becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
choose a valuable and am@@ using learning about safety - but let &apos;s never pass any one &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and your sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water that will then place in the freezer , but fli@@ ck@@ ering your possessions in ceiling no more than twice .
H@@ ousing Complex for refugees , All@@ scre@@ am , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ ne
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ men , situated in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ hart terra@@ ced houses , are prepared for people who have not much money .
and therefore , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees only need living space , but also the mother and the R@@ ich alone services . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad , as you can still book today and to build a good title , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old .
thousands of refugees ch@@ ur@@ ned on the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur of Markus G@@ ild@@ ner wants to know how quick favorable living space can be created : it builds in a project H@@ ousing for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ men , many refugees are depri@@ ved of the housing market .
what solutions do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ men : the mass lodging in containers or sport in all containers has no sustainability .
for people remain in a major part here .
because of the refugee disaster , we also need enough living room over the next decades .
a completely ban@@ ish , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ a : a town@@ house needs the f@@ ew@@ est room .
it facilitates the integration .
that is different when people in the houses are located in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are built just in the pilot project , consists of three accommodation units for each of the asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees live , it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be changed according to each individual needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ a : the price for 160 sqm living space per house amounts to € 184 000 , no property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is reasonable .
do the regulations have their plans too complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ men : I made my project correctly .
it makes it especially difficult to help the dro@@ h@@ itch of a special super@@ structure and the slot .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ throwing , who , in a row house , creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities the space is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local people react to their terra@@ ced house ?
G@@ ild@@ men : there were those who were accused of having used luxury homes for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not correct .
but do not hide the opp@@ en@@ ent apartments for paid apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ men : true , however : in the last five years , we had a building boom in Germany , but build luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , too , the normal people needed living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother , or the sole hei@@ rs alone .
I &apos;m glad to see how you can build and install it today .
it is about that .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone release , when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be requested by adding to the mounting @-@ App , &quot; General &quot; type and then &quot; software update &quot; .
if it is prepared , give you the phone to download and then install .
some may be pushed on a problem following the installation , because they have an error message appears that the &apos; software update is missing . &quot;
in order to get the problem , users are recommended to wait either before the ons@@ lau@@ ght is back or trying to update through iTunes .
through the rest of the process you will carry through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ etion of Apps - but Apple has made it more likely to do so through the sting of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to delete it if you install a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your cell phone is re@@ charged while the update is re@@ charged or is located near a loader wagon , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple is not going to accept that the update is likely to continue on a half way , as it may lead to a termination of the update .

one from the group of Afghanistan , a 17 @-@ year old communist , followed according to the police officers and two friends at a distance of approximately five meters and called to them to wait for him to wait .
at this time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
three persons also stopped on the premises of the gas station .

the last young man came home from his friends now .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a car up to their apartment , and e@@ cho@@ ic@@ e@@ ed several times .
when you saw the car no more , the land@@ lord passed the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was once again attacked from the ra@@ cket and another male person .
while increasing the head@@ light , one is convincing on the face and the th@@ igh of a victim .

a many places in the countryside were still absent - A@@ sen@@ dorf under it : Dr. Frank Mu@@ eller will take the practice of rock in October on 1st October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ iz is in retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich assumes his successor in the coming months still with half a space .
after the change phase the practice will be back on 12 October . until then , he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us straße 6 .
it was an excellent show of sympath@@ y for the first view of the years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ met@@ l who is currently going to education for education in the national hospital , who also wants to enter into practice in the year .
&quot; we always had the mind that the tr@@ ash would suit us well into practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ pro@@ blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints and laugh@@ s .
&quot; when it was far , I called them . &quot;
the idea of the wife was the idea to operate in the A@@ sen@@ dorf office in future .
&quot; the close proximity and the continuous contact with the patients are very attractive , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he will see , be his own boss , too .
and so it was agreed that m@@ ash &apos;s gar@@ bage bought the house with the practice .
indoor will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
in 1994 , two @-@ time family @-@ law Frank Müller was also employed in Hannover , with his medical studies in Hanover and hospitals in the hospitals and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .

from September 19 , the practice of the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ den@@ ausen as a general practition@@ er , his wife has been speci@@ alis@@ ing in Ur@@ sel ( inter@@ ni@@ st@@ ine ) on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final head comes out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ met@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we would even offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound examination and long @-@ term - and exposure @-@ EK@@ GS , and need more talk @-@ rooms .
the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50000 euros will kick the tr@@ ash@@ back in the context of a promotional program from the County ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; it shows how proud and joy@@ ful is that the practice is resum@@ ed , &quot; says distin@@ ctions of interest , Bernd Bor@@ mann .
approximately 2000 patients are living according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ met@@ l each quarter in the practice of Fel@@ ipe , in the North German langu@@ ag@@ ulation about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is still another dental practice .
a positive effect on practice was made by Frank Mu@@ eller : the chem@@ ist remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to the Ur@@ sel W@@ iz@@ dorf .
if no other replacement had been found , she would have gone .
on the way , who is visiting radi@@ ant , looks at the way still in confi@@ ded faces , and takes over the seven medical specialists and do the cleaning force of the rock .
with their departure we made an era in A@@ sen@@ dorf . after all , the physician will still pract@@ ised there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; commemor@@ ated the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints of the mouth .
a little is sp@@ un at the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we were still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or , many people will see what they often don &apos;t see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the inter@@ ni@@ st@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband re@@ lu@@ ck@@ ingly : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; I have always pressed myself against gar@@ dening , but it could become different . &quot;
Moreover , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we are growing for refugees &quot;
&quot; we have now gone on our border checks on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of State Johanna , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls in the Hungarian border stay parallel in parallel .
now , it is clear that everyone wanted to raise a demand for asylum , which could also &quot; of course &quot; of course . &quot;
the power supply and security of people are fore@@ ground .
it &apos;s clear , however , that there are significant signals , &quot; said the Minister for Foreign Affairs .
the people must know that limit@@ less migration flows are not accept , even over the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
in addition , the Croatian government had previously indicated that Slovenia would continue to travel refugees in Austria and Germany , and corridor for refugees too had built cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees too .
that , in this way , the Minister of State , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ ner Z@@ N@@ dar in L@@ ai@@ bach did not consider .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is absolutely un@@ acceptable , but Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled by the border of a Schengen Area .
as the Minister of Ministers stressed , Slovenia wants to un@@ lock his borders for refugees but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commit@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ ner Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government divided , the first refugees had already tried in the evening hours for Tuesday , trying to travel in Ost@@ Croatian , at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police stor@@ med them in the near Ma@@ is@@ ic fields .
according to local media , in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ari@@ nik , police cars will ever host to mark a number of police cars with new refugees .
it most often are led to the Syrians and Afghanistan , among them many women and children .
the Red Cross are also in use and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the next few days there will be country with more than 4,000 refugees , Minister of minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
by addition , busses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously carried migrants to Hungarian border , were directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade asser@@ ted that it was necessary to en@@ act certain routes through certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , nor will we do this ? &quot;
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ elec@@ ts , during the day further buses were expected during the day .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
its occup@@ ants had been travelling all the night , some 500 kilometres away , by Serbia and Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police said that we should go there , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
this could indeed happen to be one ahead of the already predicted shift of the former Balkan route , Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a little further west distance .
&quot; 2 : &quot; comprehensive opportunities to cross control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had pointed out that its country for the case of a strong addition of refugees have prepared appropriate plans for possible shooting situation .
though he called not &quot; details , &quot; it pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; options to limit control . &quot;
use the strict controls in order to qualify for the membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners operate through the country since then a good report which affects the standard controls .
on the Serbian side the Hungarian border will continue to rise approximately 300 refugees .
according to the media reports , they have spent the past night at the border crossing into Hor@@ g@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two mar@@ g@@ inal passages of Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g will continue to be closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees only wish to travel to the Croatian border , still remains un@@ clear .
the Serbian interior minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stefan@@ ovic proved to calm in practice at a local time in Hor@@ g@@ os . he reports on the debate about alternative refugees of refugees , after the Hungarian border now is closed to rever@@ t .
it would currently not be much more refugees to flee .
you can &apos;t even say if they were able to continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
hel@@ pers on immigrants - hazardous and alternative sources
however , private health insurance companies have already begun to spread over the refugees on land maps , where alternative routes are drawn up by Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border , there are even 20 years after the end of Croatia still not always ti@@ dy mine fields .
on Wednesday morning the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance were sent to the border region .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ers Club organis@@ ers this action on its 20 @-@ year existence , which is quite confron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ers &quot; Gui@@ ding En@@ treat is available as a member of the trade fair for questions and talks in a volunteer .
while a Pass@@ ant spont@@ ane@@ ously takes the chal@@ k and the sentence for &quot; my life be@@ j@@ uly , &quot; you can read , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supplemented by the camper by the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue , remain , remain , say names like &quot; so far , I &apos;m not yet talking and then go further . &quot;
again , at the edge of little discussions on the action , we develop across the life of dealing with the death .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is right on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I tell me that when I come to the end of this world , I am responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical Mannheim plant , which is the holder of the World E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
it is under@@ stand@@ able that everyone on the tablets will un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally relate , it was under@@ stand@@ able and in the end the action was a very personal cause .
the topic of death and death is subject to as before with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ as , just as through the Hosp@@ es movement has helped the minds through the past years .
here is an assessment that forks by Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
the star@@ vation and grape juice is one of the volunteers in the first hour .
being confron@@ ted by a personal experience with the theme , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the death aid .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Races began with a call , she immediately reported and was with the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 honorary members - 43 women and two men - the interested and relatives in private households , hospitals , nurs@@ ing homes and Hos@@ pi@@ z St Vincent .
they all are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id is able to handle good experience and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another pond , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep it precious , and speak for an instant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pun@@ ian E@@ cum@@ en@@ ian Hospit@@ all@@ service offer is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ation@@ .
the financial support of the health insurance and donations from members and clubs allows training as well as education and super@@ visions of the mortality and trau@@ ma leaders .
every two years , training for new employees will be offered .
the students , on Saturday , are exhibited in the house of the Evangelical church ( M1 , 1a ) , and in the Catholic Church &apos;s house ( F2 , 6 ) .
there , more personal wishes can be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ income mixed , business outlook for 2016 lower
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported little dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ber @-@ gi@@ ant sens@@ ed his profit margin to a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight and high costs in its sports tourism .
the company also said that she is planning to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to stop 50,000 seasonal workers for the vacation period .
the share fell by over 2.5 percent in the market market at 45 minutes before the opening ceremony .
F@@ ed@@ Ex based commented you to earn a win between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents compared to the previous forecast .
analysts expect a survey conducted at Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
despite the increase in price increases , this amount of 4.9 percent is an increase in price increases , and in spite of higher supply for land transport of heavy and large packages starting at the end of November .
the company stated that it is likely to expect the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth in the expansion sector .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; the Company has a solid sale , if people are considering the expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global commerce , in general , &quot;
the plans for the vac@@ ations of employment were then constituted during a day later than the rival , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra lab@@ our@@ ers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex generated 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which asked the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research Research and Development .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion euros .
six out of z@@ acks en@@ quired for an expected amount of 12.@@ 23 billion .
over the past few years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has posted a decline of the international lawyer &apos;s shipping company , which had stag@@ n@@ ating with sales in his unit express delivery .
but the boom in the online shopping has increased the results by F@@ ed@@ Ex .
in the last quarter sales of the Bo@@ d@@ goods transport increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was fundament@@ ally flat because of higher costs for bigger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit reported higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result is due to higher operating costs in the cargo business .
at the market market , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 percent , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
at Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
they strateg@@ ist two days a week to their most expected conference in the years , the Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist two days a week to decide whether it is time for nearly a decade for the first time ever since almost a decade .
threatened above them at an end of the dedicated , double @-@ standing sitting rooms , there is a mur@@ al in the United States .
the map is a reminder , so the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues must set economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double @-@ fold contract from the congress to maxim@@ ize US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is a third @-@ term comm@@ ent@@ ment : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday that the U.S. economy is ready to be released , by the exceptional amount of interest due to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it &apos;s soli@@ dly growing , the latest tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could increase the fact that will@@ at@@ ility thereby strengthen interest rates for federal government bonds - and also it &apos;s only by one fourth percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obvious , the job market and inflation will be the main outcome of what they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of the Mak@@ ler@@ ship Sti@@ bal Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I guess , if they were looking for a pre@@ text to raise the interest rate , the increased un@@ certainty is enough to just@@ ify the global market enough to maintain it , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus about what the F@@ ed will do , which is un@@ insured in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists approached recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg have been asked by a interest rate hike this week .
however , the financial markets are expecting a F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which indicates a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline of the stock market if the F@@ ed significantly increased the proposition , unless the gu@@ ild breaks to fatal if they promise that an increase is not far off .
Dow Jones Industrial &apos;s performance jum@@ ped on Tuesday 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points , or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed politics took the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ go , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does so , it would have to be very much in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not come into pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts argue that a interest rate would remove the financial markets , because it would cease to resolve the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would do .
even before a month the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence to 0.25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow@@ ing of mon@@ et@@ ary@@ y conditions , which would test the strength of rest in the US .
in the spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen were said that this year , despite the compla@@ ins of liber@@ als , which would expect more economic benefits , an increase of the proposition is expected .
although the job of job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was largely solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and near levels that F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases are shown signs of a recovery .
although inflation was constantly in the annual goal of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives told that the main reason the temporary effects of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can deal@@ with higher interest rates and it is necessary to take them on the job market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on M@@ acro@@ a .
but the financial markets around the world were together around the end of the last month , after China was counting its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average Value dropped by more than 16 % in May by over 16 percent below its peak as investors , that the slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thr@@ ott@@ led the global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , while the Dow &apos;s now account for nearly 10 % below the high level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when you should increase the interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the frag@@ ility of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate , and a former employee of the US emergency bank .
now it is predicted that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China &quot; says O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the principal subjects of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the final interpretation the F@@ ed Monetary Fund is now become the world .
the influence of the central bank was in the last years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the actual evidence of the then director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; broke down its mon@@ et@@ ical expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; dis@@ appo@@ intments around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where economies and economies are increasingly under@@ lined with each other , the F@@ ed representatives are expected that they do not only super@@ v@@ ise the developments of other markets , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding for the global economy .
their decision was &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Private Banking in New Year &apos;s Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , recently confirmed that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of inter@@ actions on financial market , which seems to be closely linked with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ ack@@ ers , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , contribute to an interest rate hike , stri@@ ped decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought F@@ ed to its head target of 0.75 % points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able impact on growth in the US . &quot; he said L@@ acker .
one year later the F@@ ed representatives re@@ shape those cuts .
the F@@ ed ought to only place aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis , as did the market leader in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee for the changing bank of the Bank of England .
the latest tur@@ mo@@ il goes not near this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly wants to come into the situation , where she has taken fear of a interest rate because the markets are thr@@ illing , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act is always the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability until which is changed , I don &apos;t think that it &apos;s time to help .

because of the additional energy requirements , fluctu@@ ations and young mothers don &apos;t use their daily calories coming to increase by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ alle@@ etic adaptation to the mothers .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet significantly increased the genes of her babies and protects them prior to the development of tum@@ ours .

the municipality of Bern@@ ward permits the building application to the 2.3 million Euros of the sports hall .
and he was an exception .
the roof is to be connected to solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited individual construction on the Bern@@ ard@@ side of the Sports Resort is proce@@ eding step by step . in the youngest member meeting the excav@@ ation without huge discussions was blessed .
before the beginning , the Board of Directors agreed to adopt an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fre@@ eing &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Ex@@ c@@ eption &quot; means the permission to form a special form of the roof structure .
according to the German and roof top , an &quot; arti@@ fici@@ ent roof &quot; should be built .
view of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; in this way we get a wonder@@ fully big roof . &quot; , Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger said in a meeting .
in &quot; Liberation , &quot; the roof prop@@ ens@@ ity to be used for energy reasons - differently than the development plan ought to be made mandatory - below ten degrees .
this hall &apos;s volume is greatly reduced .
also a &quot; Liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan allows no &quot; exceptions &quot; due to the development plan , whereby the Bern@@ ard@@ stick is generally disp@@ at@@ ched between the maintenance agreements as a rule .
but in the case of intervals , this is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we are not going to be a preced@@ ent &quot; about our stand . &quot;
the Sports Centre at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ward .
at costs , roughly 2,3 million euros have been calculated .
grants are expected from the school and installation support .
in the next step of procedure , the building entry will be submitted for the 18 x 36 metres of large hall owners to the meeting .
the P@@ ei@@ v@@ berg family moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ro@@ berg hospital is supposed to be closed as planned earlier - in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed to the hospital at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station as well as the majority of staff go by P@@ ei@@ ro@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district , confirmed by the wh@@ en@@ ologist Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , a decision about the Supervisory Board however , and the meeting held on Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans were implemented , all the just under 50 workers would be working at the P@@ ei@@ ro@@ berg hospital .
the majority of them should go through a fisher@@ man and the existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees , which may not be sold to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , as J@@ och@@ ar @-@ white .
the staff will be informed about plans .
the move to Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who only began the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic only since the beginning of the year , is now replaced by a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
with the question he who is to take up , according to J@@ och@@ ar @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer has &quot; entered the game who declared himself ready to take over management and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of October 1 .
the house may cover a &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , which offers a &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; of the range of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ar @-@ White .
fisher@@ man is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ br@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside of our gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
at the same time , fishermen would go through to his team when the Supervisory Board is right to grant to both homes up until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ y@@ an@@ ship , which has more than 35 beds , is expected to final once again in P@@ ei@@ ro@@ berg at almost 140 years .
so far , the District had planned this until 2018 , when the current renovation of the hospital at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim is completed .
governor of J@@ och@@ ar @-@ White , also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , spoke according to which the house , which is in possession of the federal government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum applicants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will close as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it is looking forward to use of the real estate , J@@ och@@ ar @-@ White could not say it might have different thoughts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there are a short time care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ ged who is kept .
&quot; what better could happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; so fishermen have been moved on through the quasi @-@ ge@@ ese move to the Le@@ ch , who had been elevated and elevated by the employees . &quot;
I have spent a truly perspective for the house in which fisher@@ man has been working as Che@@ color for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ v@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure of closure , departments were closed again in recent decades , for example the surgery and birth aid .

refugees - Refu@@ ge@@ es : study war@@ ns at the housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ sion@@ ed .
and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing assembly stands at a challenge .
the distribution of the market in the German housing market has long ago .
with refugees and unemployed people from the EU , more and more people push on a market which is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with money @-@ up citizens in order to pay the last @-@ paid apartments .
to meet the demand for affordable dwellings , we would have to build 400,000 new units by 2020 .
at this result , a study was conducted by the pro@@ ving of a network of social housing . &quot;
in comparison , a total of 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be finished in Germany this year .
your 140@@ ,000 houses are missing .
according to the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ time period .
many meet then in the home market and lined up in the long queu@@ es before the flats .
however , according to the Federal Office of the Federal Office in the last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were rent .
the negative development of the housing market is not only in the rising of the refugee .
the study also provides significant changes in the housing policy of the past years .
Germany sh@@ unds a residential deficit ahead of itself , which gets bigger from year to year .
at the moment , Matthias Günther , author of the study has already been formed in the metropol@@ itan areas .
so many voc@@ alists lived in the big cities , and they were predominantly in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed at the residence market for no longer to stay in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in the past few years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Soci@@ etal Coh@@ ort &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
thereby , new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social housing development again .
thus , we could not be wai@@ ved on the base tax and set the base tax on set @-@ up properties .
in addition , an alliance of attractive depreciation was required .
the funding programme for refugee accommodation with the state bank Kf@@ W now also be available in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start of the Monday evening , 184 million euros had already been constituted more than half of the provided € 300 million .
now the project could even be enlarged .
refugees have free bed : Croatia and Slovenia announces a hallway
practically no more refugees is coming to Hungary , since more and more refugees are located in the way for Croatia .
Zagreb announces intention to grant a trip over Slovenia into the north without hur@@ dle .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Minister , and if it &apos;s necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister for the Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen country .
following the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees escap@@ ing from Croatia to reach Western Europe from there .
500 people had come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , thus the Croatian remote @-@ television station known .
Hungary was set off its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws which came into force on the same day are , in Hungary , make the best early asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to allow the refugees to flee .
the Croatian Prime Minister declared Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic guilty : &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for that possibility . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and do something .
however , there are people who wanted to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border to the EU border country .
most of them were from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came in both with the bus as well as with tax@@ is in the Serbian border of S@@ chloride .
immediately after her arrival , she had been trying to get on foot on the green border to Croatia .
it came to the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , while the refugees are not at the f@@ ences .
the border strip suggests other d@@ angers : there are still sharp left from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90 &apos;s .
mine aud@@ ited should now be able to give quickly a secure account .
after the closing of the border lost barely more refugees , after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police were driven by the police .
shortly before the closing session on Monday there were only 9@@ 380 people .
the new Hungarian government sets the over@@ coming and damage to the limit value as an off@@ ense .
in the southern Hungarian border of Sz@@ eged , only 35 patients were initiated .
the convicted sentences become sentences of up to five years and their deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , you have asked for asylum in the newly set &quot; transit house &quot; in total 94 , of which almost all - 93 - the most important trans@@ lat@@ ors of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicant they are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning 70 refugees had been displaced .
practically , however , no one has received a view to receive asylum in Hungary .
after an un@@ critical view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
there are pending asylum seek@@ ers there .
only a few hundred refugees assembled at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &quot; at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean .
they raised the tr@@ ash@@ ine , which tens of thousands of people left the roads in the past few weeks .
rack grid were dis@@ located and one of the close @-@ up rules on the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to sell this building to its end .
Austria is a mere hundred refugees only after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
this also has reinforced its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants are still considered the government in the country .
in Salzburg , 1400 people are waiting for the further drive to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the order of German authorities .
during the fre@@ ew@@ heel of many years , several hundred refugees met from refugees .
Mayor , &quot; rocks &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy upon the bridge on Sunday , with the evacu@@ ation project when 10 people were employed with travel agents at the entrance of the Zel@@ ts , &quot; as Win@@ ning Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists who wanted to sow the train to Pas@@ sau .
because Germany had surprisingly demanded the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday only because of the refugee disaster , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and were assisted together with two other hel@@ pers , and their cars crossed the border into the Nah@@ e Pas@@ sau .
before we all got delicious guests only once , with snack and drink .
we immediately said , we &apos;ll get them by car to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; this was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not take it to hand a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; it is very pleased , &quot; says the Stad@@ ler .
the planned draw@@ backs were updated on Sunday night in a series by ICE in a series towards Pas@@ sau , following the short notice that rail traffic was stopped in Germany at the time , but still over the limit .
but the regional train was completed before the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein at the Inn .
in advertising , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge strongly connected to the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , day before a two @-@ bridge racing - organised by the Union of Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
since Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending for more of thousands of us , a logical result of an apparent f@@ law is :
instead of bearings at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , the German Chancellor , our German Federal Chancellor , has officially recognized and publicly re@@ constituted the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ ak of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ war@@ ts of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are confron@@ ted now into the border regions with cha@@ otic sur@@ fers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the poultry users have to determine that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ ed land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they are invited and welcomed , nothing as another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a huge challenge , in view of the persistent conflict and the exception of the coming winter to let us decent conditions for protective e@@ seek@@ ers .
and yet there will be major achievements - peace , security , and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 prisoners of snow
Konrad Adenauer , in the case of the refugee , began to do full of the hands .
Christian Konrad is it , in fact , that his word has weight .
the government has used the previous strong Rai@@ ff@@ eisen to find tor@@ tures for tens of thousands of refugees .
having already received the chaos in the first time of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad get already in his hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we no longer left the homeless more in Tra@@ cing Gel@@ sen@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a host , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry spoke about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risk @-@ cl@@ ine situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Konrad pit , a total of 8@@ 5,000 quot@@ as in the w@@ aged year , Konrad pit .
to meet the number , some 35,000 accommodations must be found within the next few weeks , enabling € 15,000 to be given by the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can make it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without a floor , &quot; &quot; Konrad .
he has led already talks with the captains of the tri@@ but@@ aries .
this could have been tail@@ ored to him , even for the future refugees too for@@ en@@ ers .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ala supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , shall be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
great expectations of the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator is also co @-@ ordin@@ ated in the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Help as we . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
in addition to the hotel , one vac@@ ate the hotels , which will be empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier predi@@ ct the standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergency times , it could not be that qu@@ et@@ ting must hold a certain amount of the case holder or the size of the finishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would have to pay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security standards for a limited time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Health , he is more successful in his experience , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who one wouldn &apos;t talk to the truth without further notice .
his primary weapon will be his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the republic any cost as it declared themselves .
the number of employees increases to three to four .
to date , the own tim@@ ental search was not yet successful .
Konrad I wanted to put a container at a favourite corner as an office .
however there are evi@@ d@@ ently problems with permission .
Linz is called a better distribution
with no opening of urban sporting and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design center to host refugees , the town of Linz is planning a city of Linz .
this doesn &apos;t necessarily need to be able to accommodate those people , without these measures , &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but in case of emergency , other locations will be checked for their suit@@ ability .
critic@@ ising the manager of the refugees at the division of Refu@@ ge@@ es within the federal state .
other areas have to make their contribution here .
sea level : &quot; limits are not sent off &quot;
in a longer telephone interview with the Bavarian Minister of Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) submitted the further procedure in refugee inquiry on Monday .
seal it assured me that the German borders are not off .
the further exp@@ editions of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany are still possible .
but now it is possible to control the relevant limits .
special trains with refugees to Germany do not want to give it any more .
however , the op@@ ards should be brought to Germany with regular trains .
according to the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger required more reinforced solidarity in the refugee crisis .
similarly , Austria also leads to controls once again , it is a logical consequence &quot; from the previous approach of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the gener@@ ational &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Bar is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and output buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T will be hosted , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) should be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IT are the basic heads of our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T Group leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine how to invest in start@@ up companies from the New Ship@@ yard and later also to be acquired .
already from the beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Lower @-@ haus@@ er really promises : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
a 1.7 million Euro have been invested in the site by S &amp; T , covering 3.3 million Euros from te@@ ch@@ c@@ Enter , which represents a third of the city of Linz , which Austria state Lower Austria and the federal state ( FF@@ G ) .
the building can be leased from the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as te@@ ch@@ c@@ Enter .
30 percent of the 2700 square meter rest area in the building are already let . for another 40 percent give it requests .

larger bags and accessories are up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
several weeks ago , it was re@@ model@@ ed .
&quot; I have long been thinking about whether I still should open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
decisive for the decision was among others , that even the fur@@ y@@ men producer who are in Bologna can be found from the idea of a own site , in which only their hand@@ bags were sold , clothed .
&quot; we are the only ones in the large area of Linz which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even ital@@ ian roots .
your fashion interest has got Bre@@ it from her mother laid in the cra@@ dle .
me , most of them , when developed something , is able to show new trends of positive value .
why did some women teach when doing a beautiful hand@@ bag in the case of a nice hand@@ bag , and I do not answer the specialist staff with the last security .
maybe it &apos;s about to stream a beautiful pocket every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
Donald Tr@@ ump , the Pf@@ äl@@ zer blades of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called wal@@ kers .
this feature connects another also to the Billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he advert@@ ised himself as a foreign valu@@ ate , journalists males , or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office and ag@@ it@@ ates the elec@@ toral struggle .
and cut along well .
we are also registered in the pe@@ eled ch@@ all@@ y@@ city , where the grand@@ parents of the property comes home .
the New Yorker with the dol@@ ph@@ on ur is one phrase by many in the v@@ int@@ ral Mountains .
in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ site , man@@ holes in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ site is related to him .
his grandfather was born in the Pfalz in the Pfalz , Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ ant lady , Simone Wen@@ del gave a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vil@@ lagers still think about his goal , the most violent man in the world ?
&quot; I believe that find the somehow exciting , but the old town of its old town is not so deeply impressed , Simone Jac@@ Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ inger has made a documentary film about the place and its famous spr@@ ing@@ ing flies , beside the Tr@@ ump , also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for confusion occurs in the Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also in word - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he live in the city of K@@ all@@ stadt .
but he brought it to the king of hearts .
it may be respect to the performance of the family , but also tend to have that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit too la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is about the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Es@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is therefore from the village of the duc@@ er .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a local for gold graves in the USA .
corner of the real estate concert were the first plot in New York .
but life of Grand@@ parents &quot; life was not free of Tra@@ p : their desire to return to home , to close to the Bavarian State , when the Pfalz were at that time .
he wasn &apos;t de@@ pl@@ ump , because he once was cut off without permission , the Director of the Institute of On@@ cology &apos;s History and Fol@@ dies , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; Il@@ legal emig@@ rants . &quot;
that stands in contrary to the mit@@ otic statements of the desc@@ end@@ ents .
originally pro@@ vision@@ ing on Mexican immigrants in the US had said to fri@@ gh@@ tened the construction of a wall to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ led , that is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a awa@@ ited desc@@ endant of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was a hum@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) .
the wine @-@ gro@@ wer in the retirement is rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so short . &quot;
does he believe that he is a little bit ?
&quot; I cannot imagine &quot; what the 72 @-@ year @-@ old says .
&quot; he has never managed to care for the city . &quot;
the guest house in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions some more beautiful K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter with a visit to the church of Heinz with a visit something that was generally well done .
&quot; I cannot imagine the Donald &apos;s , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
they do not know better if he does not count the choice , because &quot; he has a radical views , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot;
if those , who had been in the direction of his grandfather in the U.S. in the USA , would have been as if he had never arrived at all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are interesting topics as it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ asch@@ al Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the last months , Today the gap to sunrise were closed .
in August Today , Today reached 3@@ 18,000 in relation to the 3@@ 40,000 members of sunrise .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
to the secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have in@@ sufficiently - who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , who was leaving the Bachelor in The Master &apos;s Sam Wood , was bo@@ unded in major sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if they are the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Mor@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows a day before they checked three two , you might acci@@ dentally give them an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood atten@@ ds his lips up to the final on Thursday sealed
the three women left the lyri@@ c about it , why Wood was the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude to reasons why they like to be in his partner .
however , when the question is posed , &quot; If not you , who would have been the last rose ? , &quot; could their answers to the game @-@ destro@@ yers , who won the heart of the bach@@ elor .
I@@ pro@@ ons , Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki , called both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood went over from the first day to a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment , when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ es energies I noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought it very well over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ con@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing at the earth with both feet and it &apos;s so much fun together with her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the correct chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam res@@ sers are well suited as a pair .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit visit was able to do so that Wood &apos; could be one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , I realise that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m already busy on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked them who then should choose , she was not subject to them .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining limb@@ s in equal measure - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is available on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on the Ten .

4 people killed after police bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators shoot in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern part of Nepal , after police che@@ er@@ ly mig@@ rated to a new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west from the capital .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Sales Officer , announced that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had assembled outside a police station , some of whom cast stones and fire@@ bombs .
M@@ R D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police was deployed in tr@@ ash@@ eng@@ as and shot in the air before turning on rubber lap .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately apparent , why the rubber pur@@ ges are known , of which they can be killed , which are typically used as a less fatal alternative , apparently weigh@@ ted that high death rate produced .
the discussion was for the last week of violent protests in Nepal as southern plains , where members of the group of Madrid has been able to say that new provinces being formed as part of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal from the group of group objects , who want to take a state @-@ owned state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent con@@ front@@ ations since the 10 years .
the agreement was signed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed by the country in provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal whose independence was centrally ruled .
however , the work on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people .
the legisl@@ ature made this week exc@@ essi@@ vely for certain cl@@ auses in the Council of Kathmandu , and officials persuaded the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

for slightly overweight people , weight diab@@ etic can be helpful .
the benefits of gravity surgery for easy @-@ overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is too early to say , whether they are overweight or obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight surgery can live longer than those who do non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; death @-@ based data need a long time to show up something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which included a mission of the new study in j@@ ama Sur@@ gery .
weight loss provisions or obes@@ ity surgery are using different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the active ability to absorb food .
over the years , obes@@ ity operations have proven as efficiently as the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were performed in humans , obes@@ e with a Body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a somewhat dimension of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 2@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of 30 are being obes@@ e .
you can find here a BMI : 1 us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the recent study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s minutes Sh@@ eng General Hospital is that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity surgery - a b@@ yp@@ ass and stomach lining - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were overweight .
the average BMI of which submitted to this operation fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who non @-@ surgical treatments have received approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ took surgical procedure , cl@@ ashed to 36 % of the disease @-@ disease and partially with 28 % .
in the medical @-@ treated group , compared to the diabetes , diabetes fully redeemed only at one percent , and in some cases , only about two percent .
Moreover , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general , in the &apos;@@ Cont@@ ext &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also over@@ saw the patient @-@ blood mirror of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after the operation the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from some 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this improved &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , so the leading researchers to Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and its colleagues .
the research team also reduces average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the B@@ yp@@ ass @-@ Sur@@ gery @-@ group lost more weight compared to the gast@@ re@@ ect@@ omy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , achieved extensive dis@@ advantages in the BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden , resulting in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people was subjected to obes@@ ity operation approximately 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group compared to the conventional methods .
although the new study did not make any advantage of survival during surgery , Black@@ stone , it &apos;s cal@@ end@@ able for individuals with a BMI of 35 , who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it states that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , &quot; no risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said .
Black@@ stone added that men and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient has a BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for a long time , until we bring people serious , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have gathered these genetic changes that have made their body to obes@@ ity and diabetes , recur@@ ring is really hard . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can get to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not record all refugees , &quot; the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is laid .
the Tibetan Buddhist priest spoke to end the violence in the homeland of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech marking the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he ordered that under the circumstances , he asked the interests of humanity against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also empha@@ sized that the reaction of West European countries on the refugee crisis is quite ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can get to Europe , &quot; he said in his talk .
though the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria gave the efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that it was a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to worry about several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions as a real peace and real development , mainly due to education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , we must think about that , how the k@@ illings will be saved in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror attack on September 11 and revealed that the non @-@ violent reaction of the USA moved out a chain of un@@ controlled events .
after September 11 , when I was expressed in a letter to President Bush , I said it , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know , his motifs were good but he set violence , and that caused an unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four @-@ fold increase of dispos@@ ition of thread @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison gas centres in the United States have an almost a 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , strongly bin@@ ations of infections , such as Georgia Po@@ ison center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of public transport in children under the age of 12 rose , and from 3,@@ 267 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly being common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them going in the emergency records , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that several children disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or for a mutation of social media because of social media .
find videos on YouTube , how people disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non@@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to receive a tough@@ er drink .
the younger children can be ho@@ oked by attractive du@@ cks of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one child does not think that this is bad for &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hands @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ don@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with earthquake , grapes and orange du@@ ft , which are very attractive for children .
Handel &apos;s disinf@@ ect@@ ant contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with infants can lead a few sp@@ lashes to the alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; related to Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , a medical director of the Gi@@ fts Congress in the Hospital of Kansas , California , and Fox 4 in sa City .
so , you would not have the si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume too much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja Russell , a 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl that has recently taken four spra@@ yers of the hang of disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school recently , was brought to treatment in a cas@@ u@@ alty .
her blood alcohol is 179 , twice higher than the threshold which is legally considered in an adult . Chris R@@ itch@@ ey said an emergency doctor that she treated in the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ th@@ jah seized her words and was not able to go to the location as she arrived in the emergency one .
doctors over@@ saw her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , because the girls had fallen by the alcohol and had disturbed his head , R@@ itch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was a very fri@@ gh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ us@@ lav Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been deadly for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended the parents and teachers to use non@@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
over breath@@ po@@ is@@ oning and disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with body waste .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football , bo@@ red Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former car @-@ based mid@@ fiel@@ der and former National Team of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic since there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ess with the angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic Games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the angers are not there .
people do not just talk about the return of angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak for both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of stress in the old building Fir@@ m games , and there are not only those in Scotland who want to see those games .
I will turn them around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Cel@@ tic should fight , but the Norwegian boss swore to rotate the things .
following the defeat of the Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat of a 10 man from Aberdeen , which is now clear with five points - clear from the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad weather before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very sor@@ row@@ ful or sad about what happened .
we just feel that , but we must go on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need to really get the support of Cel@@ tic because that would make someone better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now summar@@ ize is so important .
al@@ bur@@ ton carefully with January Trans@@ fers
despite his comments , just a few weeks , which indicated that he wants to deteri@@ orate a couple of January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton wants to inter@@ fere with the signature of new access , and insi@@ sts that he doesn &apos;t want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ CEO by Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from Summer Window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer will have this season period to integrate what you &apos;ve ever seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more harm is done by making money necessary for what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it increases in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at the rate of May 16 , unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole grew by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scottish unemployment level of 5.9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime the employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the state Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for greater economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost almost a year ago , Scotland hopes to put the historic decision in Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment .

why I will be a result of an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not occur , I will sit in an on@@ look@@ er gallery during the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed by the poison injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first paid for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I voted .
when the day was near@@ er , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agree , as I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and as many applications are now available as spaces , an imp@@ ending lottery takes place in order to decide who is chosen .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media locations from 12 to five .
if you were chosen , it will work on the basis of the engine .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ s@@ ps of a closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often much , when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist . so it is not allowed to take a not@@ ebook with a pen and to draw a pen in order to see what I see .
I must try to remember all of the details .
one journalist , from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of taking on Twitter to aband@@ on my party .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you can get access .
I determined with her for her .
they say that they could better capit@@ ulate it , &quot; but they still think it &apos;s doing wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he tells me not what I have written , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wishes to be an international repor@@ ter there to write in .
if he dies , he thinks that the public relations between the movement is being transferred to the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ar , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is born next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of po@@ d@@ casts that I made .
I will not want to go back here all the details again .
I can not say to security that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Carter Tre@@ ese would be guilty of having a favourable expression .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough pro@@ ofs to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really intellectual .
there will be other repor@@ ter for which you can turn back .
what you get by me is what it means , a man to see an un@@ necessary death .
man , after mo@@ ist police @-@ persec@@ ut@@ ants , speak to the C@@ anning River to come to

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards attempted to approach it and threat@@ ening to end the race racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria had tried to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he presi@@ ded over the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and maintained that they conducted a personal campaign against him with L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media that he is always trying to do what is best for the race sport and he himself found themselves under difficult conditions , when it was concerned about the positive cob@@ alt test sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
however , it had been held for 18 months because of the sp@@ y sentence , and didn &apos;t want that &quot; outstanding &quot; like to be da@@ zz@@ ling grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said nothing to say about this , and I have been very fearful , but at times you are fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes one respon@@ ds to , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it , which I have said .
now I &apos;ll go home this night and sleep well .
I want to go about my main walks , and I want my owners to think that I am doing my best for them .
when you start to think , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
first , Moo@@ dy had received the bomb during an interview with Sam@@ ur@@ .com that his career had already attempted to send his stud .
&quot; eighteen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart said in a room with a man - whom I will name - and bears from him an employment in my st@@ ables , to supply information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
it is obvious that I am a ch@@ eat .
if that is the case , they should certainly take their n@@ oses , because they tried to hold me , they have failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy &apos;s CEO of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , most recent CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were at the same time as at the time .
should I bring that to my mind that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L does not triumph and makes people responsible outside of athletes responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I po@@ or@@ ly for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people are standing outside that I am it .
maybe they have to take my license and drove me away , and I don &apos;t doubt that what I am talking about it now .
but I have arrived at the point that which is no matter , and it makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will p@@ ite the pressure on them and ur@@ ge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer have built up a long @-@ ongoing Cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to it that he could cast down his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known for his preparations for a distant Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , proved the best @-@ time treatment treatment , &quot; after a package of mud or clay were applied to the horse &apos;s influence on the basis of the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take responsibility for this full responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my members had applied er@@ ron@@ eous lu@@ dge on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , what was also like that .
but it was the same on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with a pack on race day . a study of this issue has been opened .
it is a joke .
people , who set up these rules , do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see one we would have rules , but here is too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy will fight against rival to Ring@@ ing about Rival for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has won the tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee have allowed the Storm @-@ player &quot; Ring@@ ing Player &quot; with his team in qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos , Wayne Bennett was a down@@ clo@@ ister to the Storm Team , after his team had reached the Final victory of North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night . he mentioned the game a &quot; para@@ dig@@ m &quot; of the Ran@@ kings of Queens@@ land , and said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two Queens@@ land players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were too good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy spread the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ mer since his team and told that it is hardly on its &quot; contact with the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leaders in his team were clearly stim@@ ulated , because it is wor@@ r@@ ying that they are wor@@ ried , to be turned off by the Storm team .
... &quot; it happens once again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson , about Ring@@ ing said that she was beaten us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed in the whole year nothing to our heart@@ y system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focus , and it has completed the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has to train one great team . he is therefore probably not getting used to lose , so it was a bit like shock to him .
it is strange as this is going back to this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has decided to attack the idea of &quot; thr@@ illing football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ i St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; bor@@ ro@@ ili@@ ent &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of thr@@ illing football .
he has set his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their play was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George being a bor@@ ing team was criti@@ ci@@ zed , and Wayne told him that he would take care of a divor@@ ce about that .
but now he has a team that can play and we do it as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play as if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 and now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this .
I constantly increased confidence because they say these things because they &apos;re a bit wor@@ ried to play against us .
six weeks ago they probably did not think about how to get the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also showed that the amazing play against Roo@@ sters is a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game but is that an ex@@ iting game ?
or are p@@ auses and don &apos;t make any points of loos@@ ing ?
for me , there are the sched@@ ules .
when they relate to us it means that we will still meet in a phase .
as happens at this weekend , the Storm team has won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin tomorrow morning .
more than 200,000 $ bond to drug @-@ refu@@ elling
a man who may be threat@@ ening a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence due to his temp@@ o , to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that have been east@@ er@@ ated according to Queens@@ land , so a deposit of $ 200,000 has been released .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u while in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mac@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he be@@ w@@ ailed on his co @-@ def@@ endants in the mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite some potentially life imprisonment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , ar@@ gued the prosecutor of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , that there is no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the cafe could have been from a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was about the escape of the river of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
it has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the case of justice , police have weighed down the police at his position .
Mac@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200.000 dollars as security together to get his release .
&quot; after reading the alle@@ vi@@ ations made by the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter , Flan@@ agan .
but this only won &apos;t be sufficient to keep him from it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was granted against damage , under the conditions that he returns to his Australian and Serbian passport , allowing the police to call every day and sat at an un@@ lock of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to lock P@@ m@@ oph@@ ile for sending images
a p@@ m@@ op@@ hil@@ ic artist used the phone over a 11 year old girl to demand pictures from childhood abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took a girl from the girl , when he slept and logged into an online Mess@@ aging service , where he received a series of un@@ decent images of children , sent from another user .
the girl was woke up later and found that the phone was missing and found it in the sleeping room of the sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess .
she saw it , she found her mother , and al@@ armed her mother immediately .
the police stopped taking care and saw the five pictures , presented and analysed computer that were found under the address and discovered the subject &quot; Web S@@ research , &quot; terms for search for continuous images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g was claimed to asser@@ t to the officials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ego &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polic@@ eman , to be a polic@@ eman , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state bank@@ rupt@@ cy of Eil@@ ab@@ h Robertson has said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sher@@ i@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be ad@@ di@@ cted , so that he ad@@ di@@ cted to fri@@ gh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the search was done on the computer of him , but he said it was going to be a polic@@ eman to make a polic@@ eman sh@@ ame@@ ful .
he was asked about his talks with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send more photos .
he said that he did so , to attract them .
he said he is sick of the person when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson Smith answered : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was with trembling and on weeping .
they then saw the in@@ gen@@ eric images on the phone , in front of the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and told that the accused took a computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girl who saw a lot younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded guilty according to the alleged bill of indictment , rejected in@@ explic@@ it paintings by children on the 14th of June last year and had not appeared before a court appearance on 24 March that year .
defence lawyer , Gregor S@@ im asked for that H@@ og@@ g appears not to be involved in the association of sexual ar@@ ders , that they could be mentioned that &quot; no si@@ ze@@ able sexual element &quot; can be found in his actions .
Sher@@ i@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael could not with@@ hold it until October , to support background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given a security deposit in this case , but was given to some other times in provisional cases because of the hear@@ ings .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are people un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has declared a ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ment of the Just@@ us Federal Te@@ gel , who has been accommodated in a small cell using a long @-@ time prison .
because of injury to her human dig@@ nity , prisoners are basically up to financial compensation , when they are housed in small cells .
in any decision this decision was adopted by the Federal Constitutional Court in one decision on Wednesday .
persons suffer@@ ers could indicate the judges to be locked on money if they were locked up a few days inside the property ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
therefore , an ex @-@ mate was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . he was accommodated in the Department of Justice , Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a cell with around five square meters of land area ; the toilet was not separated from the toilet .
afterwards , the man , who has now been lying down to the foot , was laid in a bigger cell .
due to the uns@@ ur@@ able conditions of detention against the country in Berlin , he failed .
however , the judges ruling the ruling of the Kammer@@ s@@ led in Berlin and gave the case a renewed review .
they see the man &apos;s favor .
Chamber judgment now decide on the amount of compensation
even if legal reasons were only for a few days of prison for the in@@ dem@@ nity for the in@@ dem@@ nity , it was the claim for compensation .
otherwise , an insur@@ rection of the personality of personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the Chamber of chamber should now be informed of the amount of money .
the judges ruling has often made the rights of prisoners of prisoners in their past .
so they said in April of an in@@ mate to harm ; because he was incar@@ cer@@ ated naked in a cell .
as a result of un@@ fitting , a decision by 2011 is also the multiple use of a cell without separate toilet .
on Wednesday , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court over@@ turned the trial of a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ ty case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff originated during a period of three months , from 15 to 21 hours in a same char@@ ak@@ y cell , like at the Charles Bridge .
the Berlin jail at the last few weeks was more than lack of their head@@ lines in the past few weeks .
so captives will therefore keep open 23 hours , who constantly increases aggressive touch , even to blows itself on account of the cl@@ amped location .
according to informations by the Department of Justice , 21 will not be occupied in Te@@ gel for lack of effort , 19 in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are able to do that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous huge challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is decided to take it .
what to get to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany following forecasts for the German Ministry of Culture in this year , according to the testimony of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to host a million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the extraordinary challenge of determination : &quot; I tell you again and again : we can do that , and we are able to do that . &quot;
what comes in Germany gives you the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( valuation of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate the pest@@ el @-@ Institut to estimate ) - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has to be built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatic , the lack of living space , but above all in paid rental objects : a yearly 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social houses are out of the rental price , and around this especially favourable apartments are also applied for refugees .
the Federal Minister , Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , has planned to double its funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
the Bank has had a lot too little enough to spend about 80 000 social dwellings per year and would have to invest in the same time funding of € 6.4 billion per ann@@ um .
in addition , scientists and Federal Minister of the Federal Council intend to give evidence that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in residential building .
according to estimates by the institute for labour market and professional research , 55 percent of the pl@@ ough@@ ing in Germany can be employed in a long @-@ term study .
however , the refugees in Germany would not even be system@@ atically en@@ forced after their qualification round , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
for the integration of refugees , it is crucial that they find working in Germany .
hard to work is the key for social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation of the admission group , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the immigrants , &quot; migration researcher Dietrich Bri@@ ck@@ hardt .
according to the employment law , a political turn@@ around has been given in Germany : the labour ban for refugees in recognition of work .
while the applied for asylum seek@@ ers has been granted asylum seek@@ ers up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the applied reservation for asylum seek@@ ers .
in the company itself , also due to the expert cro@@ w , aimed at improving the visibility it was , that refugees that are able to enable the up@@ take for the job market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German language skills .
at present there is no alternative offer for general and occupational training courses .
studies also show that work@@ stations are often conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
therefore , the structure of Networks is according to the view of thr@@ ills the Royal Path to the integration of integration .
the Berlin school management revealed that only few planned parents give their children to the day@@ car@@ es , estimated to say 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting of parents , it is only once important to meet the family , &quot; says Il@@ ya cos@@ m@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate .
in order to convince the family from the benefits of the K@@ ita , the shopping cart@@ ons are spread in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ating education by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacities in the Berlin Senate - by providing more subjects .
students without German language skills are prepared for classes in the countries .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of said Be@@ ate St@@ em from the Berlin school management .
the German Student Union estimates that some 20 % of refugees are studying in Germany .
basically , no Bundes@@ land@@ marks are not allowed to apply the@@ German rules of asylum seek@@ ers or don@@ or - the only exception until now Berlin , Interior Minister Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has left its position now .
study participants could be facilit@@ ated from the education of the university .
since refugees with a residence permit or any application , he will not receive any benefits after the application of the asylum application , unless they study a study .
the latter contains no B@@ af@@ il@@ g , as they are not involved in the circle of shelves .
previously , Refu@@ ge@@ es had to have lived for four years in Germany to have been eligible to participate in B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , and from 1 January 2016 , those sections have been shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap has to be closed though , in turn , Steffen Kra@@ ch , the State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should get b@@ af@@ est@@ ess immediately .
in future , Islam will continue to play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion is an important part of her identity .
the state should suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely by the same rights as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ churches right to establish a new state @-@ religions .
it would also be important to the creation of a new International who made professional com@@ ers to process the new@@ com@@ ers .
these beings belong to the rights .
so the representatives of Islam have to cooperate with a few and ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to establish a certain control possibilities .
he also belongs to the will@@ ing@@ ness to develop a cour@@ ageous basis against religious fundament@@ alism .
the candidate of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern , religious conflicts could also be carried into place in Germany .
those seeking other conflicts in Germany would immediately do their right to finish here in Germany , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law ( arab@@ ic ) .
in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the entire society .
an under@@ statement will also change the majority of the majority of discrimination , meaning that the reduction in discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - as a decade of European decisions I have been a anti @-@ discrimination law and a general Equ@@ al Opportun@@ ity Act .
it became very slow , as the NSU @-@ part series showed , in the police and authorities ignored the ra@@ cially offensive .
the chances for all that mig@@ rant organisations and the stak@@ eholders that are oblig@@ atory for what international agreement as the anti @-@ terrorism in Germany need to become reality in the next few years , when the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for well @-@ being .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the far expected refugees , according to the example of faith , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; what Man@@ or Power and Capacities all@@ u@@ ded , we encourage the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the daily level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , extra money would have to flow into the system .
to avoid confin@@ ed pas@@ sports , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , all com@@ ers to the student during the registration of health .
the services could be reck@@ oned later by the federal states .
and in the long term it is very frag@@ ment@@ ary , as many people with the limited catalog of services discussed the application of the asylum application .
otherwise , they were to do the doctors especially the language bar@@ riers .
as far as before , the Berlin @-@ based health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de , migrants are met@@ ro@@ wed with a change on their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , in the medical practices , for payment , they are required to pay them .
in all , many refugees have also been helped with more common medical areas in the emergency department .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refugee children there is much more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the yo@@ ung@@ sters there are people around with HIV pre@@ ten@@ ment .
this year@@ ling , however , was seen from some other cases of illness , but it is clear that Mont@@ gom@@ ery Village .
&quot; paras@@ ite enbe@@ ut@@ ants or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to know . &quot; and what about the reason @-@ time , the refugees suff@@ ices even as harm@@ less in sight .
the Syrians had a high @-@ developed education system , and some refugees have even doctors .
in order to pract@@ ising practi@@ cing , they &apos;d have to prove their qualification and if possible once .
at least half of the refugees coming to Germany is mentally ill in Germany , after estim@@ ation of p@@ sycho@@ therap@@ ies ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) . most of them suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic interference or depression .
in particular , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ pt@@ K , are especially strange .
a recent study by the TU Munich found that every fifth Austrian refugee community does not traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
the one who suffered from a post @-@ traum@@ atic dis@@ mis@@ ation is suff@@ ers from the so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs of respiratory , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ ins and death .
further symptoms are sleep - and concentration disorders , severe terror and emotional re@@ dness .
to prevent the symptoms from a chron@@ ically early treatment , Mun@@ z declared .
yet only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received a p@@ sycho@@ therapy .
while a mental asylum seek@@ ers can introduce asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices a request for p@@ sycho@@ therapy , but this process usually takes several months .
in addition , in the majority of the adults , state workers or doctors would decide not to have trained medical conditions , whether or not whether a therapy do not become necessary or not .
this often bring out to mis@@ under@@ estimate , says Mun@@ z .

Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst joined this position also : &quot; we don &apos;t go well to our animals , we don &apos;t feel good . &quot;
every pet unit - approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every pet unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read from the eyes once every wish .
we want to work with the animals and we have fun with them .
if the beast doesn &apos;t feel , it doesn &apos;t want to take it into the arena .
the top commandment thus : good for the animals .
particularly based on the Zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a shuttle bus and a zeb@@ stra@@ st@@ mare , the family is proud of .

Sim@@ ur@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps false witness in the parliament
M@@ R Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained unchanged , but the video of the case spread rapidly through the social media .
the parliament in the parliament was also swept away by statements made by members of the opposition that they could have made anonymous access to anonymous and warned against Mr Mu@@ gabe and Mr Mu@@ gabe and had been warned of Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month they had men@@ u@@ ed him , and during his speech to the State of the Nation in Parliament . this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Experim@@ ents ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition rulers have received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which they warned for Mr. Mu@@ eller &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number which is not displayed , but it is the title &apos; death &apos; , &apos; he said to journalists , as well as a pla@@ ylist .
it war@@ ns the Chamber of Dep@@ uties , that the imm@@ unity ends in the Parliament and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard are expected to build 25.000 - 30.000 jobs within the framework of infrastructure and investment efforts to secure the company &apos;s services .
in this year , the company will be divided into two listed companies , distribut@@ ing the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service operations .
the expected added period leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP stated in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive Officer , to der@@ ive the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta states that te@@ amm@@ ates will have to stand in front of the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb with the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ one
W@@ enger emphas@@ ised that it wasn &apos;t until September , and if its rehabilitation run according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optimi@@ stic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ one is sure to be missed to be at least the next four games for England . in view of its history , his participation in the next summer on the European Championship is still un@@ certain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ er had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then back again to its old sw@@ ung during the pre@@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of injury is not the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone , which healed not well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries described before .
this may be true from a medical point of view , but as can well @-@ recognized , there is the corresponding danger of other injuries , always if a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops an agre@@ able pattern .
Prime Minister &apos;s premi@@ er income recorded 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ er since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 from Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 Lig@@ ur@@ oses in the last five seasons .
the wider coverage for Arsenal had that they were in six of eight working hours since 2007 @-@ 08 one of the Premier League clubs they had to list the most vulner@@ ability days .
in close contact the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but he ar@@ senal there will be an improvement in the risk of injuries throughout the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back by injury , you have a time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the batt@@ ling power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope his body stabil@@ izes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career back through the nature he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal , his Champions League will start on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb , front of the games against Manchester at Saturday and the Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ els@@ berg next Wednesday , and W@@ enger is stepping into the team inside the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ ate he@@ y and Art@@ eta will probably start to play .
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of After@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to leave a little break @-@ off break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal are visible , thanks to group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest system @-@ in effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also ro@@ uted after 41 games after the &quot; unbe@@ atable &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night but was measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is in mind that Arsenal had educated the teaching from the past season with the Champions League Ac@@ cum@@ ulation to Monaco and will continue from the distant hope to introduce the association to his first European debut .
&quot; this drive has been immense , &quot; he said W@@ enger .
it has never been folded for Arsenal .
we were in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy @-@ Show that grants us serious lesson about men of sex
the lack of similar statements in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to what need to open , now has become more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as suicide in young men in a 15 @-@ year h@@ och .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 @-@ 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more often in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against the Living Mis@@ er@@ ance ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ ent life ) 2015 was announced as the year of the man to question the question that men seek to seek help if they need them .
Friend@@ ship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
a recent study involving more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms informed that if the suffering has a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy sen@@ timent , &quot; his chances of recovery being doubled .
for those who are not pressed these days , a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends takes the risks of mental problems .
but of course we have to have friends , that a friendship can work .
in the age of more than social media @-@ led communications , focusing on style over substance , the inf@@ alli@@ bility of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strongly , li@@ fel@@ ong and successful , doubled , even if the isolation is dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what ant@@ ec@@ ologist ex@@ tr@@ ample values ; money , image , social status , everything on expenses in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship which reli@@ es much deeper into our spiritual health .
and like a video game inventor , and a Billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money is really not able to buy .
the beautiful form of Friends , that this focus was changed on the head .
each character has not been defined by its work but through its personality , the interaction among the interaction of a friend .
hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent U@@ mar@@ ines , moments in football stri@@ ves in cozy S@@ ilers and the nost@@ al@@ gia of Ross and Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can rely on any case even if they are often back , fully resear@@ ching their feelings .
as a co @-@ worker of the telephone past@@ oral care stated to me : ... &quot; my listen@@ ers &apos; role for people suffering from depres@@ sive and , it has really showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not in the situation to talk to friends .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mo@@ k Malmö citizens
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his second hit on Malmö .
di Maria is in his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to back on Malmö .
here are the Report and response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain and his Champions League season started with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ sch@@ stadium in Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought the french champion to their way , but afterwards they missing a number of occasions before they finally achieved their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved one head .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also take a strong start to the Swedish master this group , since it won &apos;t only win the qualification for the K.@@ I.@@ .-@@ Show , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ ches in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ in Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs adap@@ ts chances in front of the gate . he was later in play against his home town team and against the club , with whom he began his har@@ kens back in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to reflect our opponents , even if there are certain things , which we have to perfect over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I was un@@ fortun@@ ate that we have not yet scored one or two other gates . &quot;
Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury to Paris for a period of three changes that took place on the weekend of 2 : 2 , except for Bordeaux in the First League , but it was kicked out by Paul @-@ Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ian wing doors became known as the man whose PS@@ G was taken on to the next stage in Europe when he ran over the last month of Manchester United where he ran as a man in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind him , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and ended up in the long corner of the network .
if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in an play @-@ off , to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ er with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle area .
but except for Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who was far reaching from Kevin Tra@@ ps on 3@@ 4th a minute , they hat@@ ched them in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself had reli@@ ed on , with some mal@@ ign@@ es and bad ren@@ dering , not least up of Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was pat@@ ched not less than five studies only in the first half and then abandoned , after making it a re@@ boot after the re@@ boot .
he noted much more skill when he brought his fellow player to play and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , after Paul Di , as a shooting rang , which was buried by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute .
the second goal finally fell to Cav@@ ani &apos;s hours after it was released . as acquitted ay@@ er , the findings of the F@@ well received a left flan@@ k by Max@@ well as visitor &apos;s left flan@@ k .
this ended all thoughts that Malmö could travel back to the game , and only take an excellent entry from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to make David Lu@@ iz , which equi@@ val@@ ents the final result before offering a spare part of equi@@ val@@ ents en Lav@@ e@@ zzi .
the trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PS@@ G sat over his team , and the Norwegian man said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish league , which did not represent the same level .
the qualification matches are not sufficient . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

first stor@@ ming , then common cold front
the night dis@@ appears in the valleys of the night@@ mare on Tuesday , like Met@@ e@@ berry sof@@ ar on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the hair dr@@ ills remain partly with storm strength by the bel@@ atory pe@@ eler .
after the rainy day of the morning again a common cold fron@@ tage crosses us , a strong down@@ turn , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature back .
like Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive underground parking area over the British Islands in a strong southern West region .
on the mountain@@ side there breaks the night into the night of hair @-@ dryer through the valleys .
in the after@@ mat@@ h , the hair dr@@ yers up to Thursday morning in the matern@@ ity valleys with tre@@ ble from 60 to 100 km / h , in some cases also pu@@ ffs and partly with more than 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can be in connection up to the adjacent ground and , and on the mountains , or@@ can of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while on the north on the ground , the dryer can swim in summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the Alpine ignition begins to st@@ ew .
here is the rain that stops to Thursday evening .
in total , the fall of the Alps reached a partial amount of more than 100 liters of rain per square meter in the next 48 hours , after heavy rainf@@ alls have already fallen in the last days .
on the morning , the hair @-@ dryer passes the air , in the consequence a cold front is rolled with a stri@@ ped , partly hor@@ r@@ vial rain from west to east through Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind blows at a sharp up to the stor@@ my , and temperatures fell notic@@ e@@ ably .
the following days are in the north @-@ autumn with 15 to 20 degrees Celsius in the south , on the other hand it is sunny and warmer temperatures of up to 25 degrees .
Rome is now a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square .
in the presence of the City of City of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , only a good name in the park on the Pol@@ io @-@ hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ formed Palace on Wednesday .
at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now true as the German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation .
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Colos@@ seum .
the name was applied to the Evangelical Church in Rome by the community of the Evangelical Church in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants told the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries than they were to live in secret parts of their faith .
it is , in a symbolic fashion , shows that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was born as a young August@@ in@@ ian Organ on the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 , several months in Rome .
he emp@@ ath@@ ered the city at that time to become sin ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions did not@@ ch him in view of histor@@ ians in his future fight against Rome in his future struggle .
Luther started , and Luther started off with his thes@@ es against the blown @-@ down church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Sle@@ dge is one of the key works that has painted Ot@@ olog@@ Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has been writing lyrics and chron@@ icle has been updated .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ ter @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , who now appeared with splendid paintings now .
the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ olog@@ Alt , who formulated in 150 motifs his whole personal interpretation King stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes have received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means a &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : in particular , the particular subject can act as a result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ is Alt worked to his Bible @-@ project for which he has met a sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tiv artistic choice from the many theme areas of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the cycles of people , such as cr@@ us@@ ades , plagues , commandments or F@@ ather@@ .
in doing so , he spont@@ ane@@ ously fascin@@ ated several partners : this is true of the Luther @-@ house with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art books .
and there is mostly the writer Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ rust , who has been dealt on the basis of painting with the respective students .
it &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible collection in the Bible and thus translated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated into Today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts were like verb@@ al mirrors by Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded in the Martin Luther &apos;s model of Martin Luther and , each in a set of the artist who formulated his very personal idea of the respective situation .
the pendant only has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows dou@@ bly a deep insight into its soul , its emot@@ ion .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately clearly a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ olog@@ Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant powers of the Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education was too first with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pipe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ is Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I tried to lay down on moving in order to empha@@ size the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot;
his second concern is , that art in a time period of time has returned to more re@@ warding : &quot; the perception of images ther@@ ics has been marked by an advertisement being lame , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced here .
artists have a taste and rejoicing , things to show .
pictures have always mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I &apos;m a din@@ osau@@ r .
Ot@@ to@@ l wants to look back to the viewer from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be discovered , to discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is seeking to look over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ food revealed on Tuesday at the launch of the Ot@@ ter @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ ter @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; to be always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ ti Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like how he under@@ stands and his pictures of life . &quot;
old did not count on them to fully understand the Bible , but it is important for him also mysterious issues .
&quot; it was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures and the text to be explained . &quot; then , a picture of the Bible was written .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler to the Luther @-@ publishing company , this work is an invitation to see &quot; his life in deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ elli Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler ( biblical ) language of love and love .
a piece of the original - paper and fla@@ w@@ ren@@ ames - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be inaugurated in the Ot@@ ter @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on 15 November .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ rail
plans had been found , the company commissioned , past@@ ors to model a circuit : one year later , almost everything was finished - still before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail was finished .
re@@ con@@ ices in politics and administration , especially with the residents who wanted to toler@@ ate the rail .
so arose top to find new space - now with formal planning and request for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the first town hall came together with Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock now in the child and youth committee .
&quot; I hope that this year has never happened ... &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then there should be no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further discussion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which began work in the former s@@ wimming@@ pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensive commitment for refugees
the DF@@ G increases its commitment for refugees from 2019 . the Bundesliga will become a clear sign in the weekends .
the football re@@ acts strongly to the adapted situation in Germany and provided the policy his help in the process of any pro@@ spective problems .
&quot; I keep this for the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle nobody can say anything that is going to nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every person to get this subject in the grip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ W chef Wolfgang K@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 23 September in Berlin , at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin , he wants to explo@@ it the situation in Germany .
&quot; I &apos;m coming back in the Chancell@@ ery and meet there Minister for Health E@@ zo@@ on &apos;s State and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the theme will play a central role , &quot; he announced .
but football can help and assist .
however the key turn@@ outs are to put the policy .
therefore , the German soccer Federation has extended his refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to look into four years .
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we secured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; stated lu@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEFA European Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some states are supporting this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ wa , a clear sign , when they are staying on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ship player ( Hermes ) , will support the re@@ print &quot; We can &quot; collect the &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone can help , wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports director Rud@@ i gl@@ utt@@ mann of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) , and described the plans as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of matter &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee &apos;s refugee goes back to everyone , nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; we are able to use soccer and children , no , we have to use our influence on our influence , influence and possibilities to help those that have suffered as incredible so , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ ders managing director Peter Ret@@ tig has talked about a &quot; prominent symbol in the league . &quot;
in this Friday the national team of women &apos;s team invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale to follow this Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach committed support of refugees as &quot; a big community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 students had launched their own projects in their locations , was great .
the same is great that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; which we have spent is living in football .
&quot; this is of great importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association has been providing with the DF@@ G selection and the German government worth 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already been called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as called Nir@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP board members loses one eye for an accident
according to several reports , the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye on several reports from the fall of July .
as an accident at the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he had fallen to midnight on a glass of water , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , and son was right and then tow@@ ed out to the street - it has told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ ak@@ Pl@@ att@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we will meet before the Supervisory Board at Val@@ dorf , &quot; Pl@@ att@@ ner said .
the 54 @-@ year old manager has been with the meeting and are &quot; fully working . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s Day ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to launch the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , I &apos;m in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I had a complete contact with the Supervisory Board and their president Has@@ well Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the U.S. , but since the summer he wasn &apos;t more in the German SAP headquarters in Val@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the Manager of &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen that something like this . &quot;
&quot; it is important to be resur@@ rec@@ ted , if one has fallen down . &quot;

the player is cont@@ ested to the table leaders of the football team in the Du@@ el with the F@@ k Kras@@ no@@ dar in the Thursday ( 00 PM / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot get back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Re@@ us will return to Le@@ verk@@ usen in the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga , the Bv@@ B @-@ Coach has a return with a return of him to the practice session in Friday . &quot;
in view of the high loads of the professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ ral positions to the Re@@ us position .

rob@@ ot@@ tos : government wants to create a pioneering role for Germany
Germany shall be , according to the federal government &apos;s will , with the transformation of the car of technological progress .
the German Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport , Alexander Do@@ ct@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides space to get investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ ctors spoke at the edge of the IAA Motor Show in Frankfurt on Wednesday at the end of the IAA Motor Show . &quot;
the automated and connected drive will increase safety safety and generate more stability on less st@@ ems , said Do@@ ctors .
he wants to address the topic even with his counterpart , the G7 states , who come together at the IAA also with representatives of the industry .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport is emphas@@ ised , among others , the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and an ascent to digital radio communications .
to try new technology , a test distance is currently based on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no additional limitation of dis@@ appearances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to review the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consequently , Germany wants to set up an international scale that ad@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars will be increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government will also apply to the present Convention on the occasion of an amendment to the Vienna Convention , which so far only considers the human being .
when automated driving takes over the car a lead , the driver will travel more and more to the passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the surroundings and process data in seconds .
according to a study announced by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
nevertheless , non @-@ profit vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the automated driving sector at its German site estimate the global study for 2025 will be € 8.4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the tra@@ des@@ man can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic policies s@@ ör@@ en bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability among accidents and security of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied in clear .
yet the Germans are yet sk@@ ep@@ tical - however , much more than the French or Americans .
one on Wednesday , on the AA anticipated survey carried out by the For@@ ster Institute on behalf of the exam@@ for@@ man@@ gan@@ zation DE@@ K@@ RA , having an autonomous dri@@ fting car over the next decade , 32 percent expect it only 20 years to believe that 31 percent believe absolutely not at all .
in France , 21 per cent of respondents expect their own car to reach 33 per cent by 2025 .
anyway , the car drivers in Germany are not yet ready to get on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey carried out by the digital building , only seven percent would agree to the control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway , you can present 15 percent of the flu@@ ti@@ ary traffic , in the case of jam 45 percent .
a good job would leave the car under no circumstances .
a review says team@@ work and double runner for table tennis .
in the event of Düsseldorf , between 25 September and 4 October , the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to battle only the single person from September 25th to October 4th .
the final decision shall be made no later than 22 September at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge drop for our team . &quot;
&quot; guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to bring the title again without Timo Scheider , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the train@@ ers Jörg Ro@@ iss@@ head told the competition at the EM @-@ course of the EM @-@ course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was located at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term meeting point in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer a cle@@ arer favorite , &quot; declared single European man Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .

Gaul@@ tier &apos;s feels great for a f@@ ant ,
it &apos;s a mix of a great fashion show and a wax w@@ ns @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ et : the designer Jean @-@ de@@ tier ( 63 ) on Wednesday launched an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which makes a sc@@ ary look sc@@ ary thanks to video proj@@ ections .
it is wearing the spectacular creation of the French designer , who out@@ fits with Mad@@ onn@@ as suit and out@@ fit together with the great star of the fashion scene , so that he stuck men in Rö@@ sacks .
&quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m a f@@ ant and the hau@@ te c@@ out@@ ure I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was so easy , &quot; it is real &quot; in the idea of &quot; Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the path ) which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the H@@ yp@@ o @-@ Culture Foundation on September 18 , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed its first attitude towards a vision on his person .
it was all this , for me , for a long time he had a bit closer to death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you arrive to the museum .
the impressive collection had already made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful garments , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ow@@ en .
it should be tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits indicate an insight into the hardly surprising work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completed a education .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is a perfectly chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall work for which a lot of work was used to stim@@ ulate the scales , such as a styl@@ ist .
14 tons of material have led the makers by Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest it was still a special treat : a leather h@@ osen ou@@ out@@ fit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are poor as men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for men who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ju@@ ti@@ ers &apos;s old t@@ ed@@ dy is one of the exhibition .
he stands for the first , ag@@ ag@@ ious sal@@ es@@ cent try to design .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he used his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , &quot; Gaul@@ tier .
if his parents were not allowed to play with a doll .
the dis@@ card of fashion , he later taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashion cre@@ ep@@ ings and saw the designs of other designers , just how Gaul@@ tier was told in Munich .
but later I bought these but of course .
he won &apos;t have to pay the object for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing , they could keep the clothes .
jewel@@ s instead of she@@ en - Pl@@ au@@ ger Point as a fashion N@@ ear@@ thy
formerly it went to the long der@@ y machines and around Pl@@ c about 70 meters to make stops .
the best@@ ow@@ at@@ est substances and tips were created in great quantity for customers , for example , to cover ceilings and she@@ er curtains .
this alone does not work anymore . Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the lead internally .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the initial times of the pl@@ ush tip played fashion a larger role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as an niche .
Rein@@ hardt names a few examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and for regional runs .
the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which re@@ jects the problem of errors , shows a growing success of the order .
those who are not used in the textile industry in Germany isn &apos;t on the market anymore .
they make one half of all the orders already .
c@@ pac@@ ed pl@@ ush is combined with nine other companies Member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only you are allowed to bear the Prot@@ ected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of the turnover are broken .
private stores and wholesale outlets are almost no longer available .
our products hardly see our customers on the same way .
the mass of mass is significantly cheaper in the East Asia and distributed almost exclusively on chains .
besides , export markets , new to Russia and the USA .
plenty of reasons so for new ways .
the industry association also attempted to score points in environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the nitrogen oxide in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; for this year , we have drawn a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt revised : &quot; the material is also referring to the used materials . &quot;
Professor von U@@ te Schmidt is Professor of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au , University School of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au , Professor of University of Applied Arts , and is specialized on boo@@ th@@ eries and tops .
to end the competition from the Asian Space , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
there is a voltage range between the fresh@@ est ideas of designer and businesses who need to think especially economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
so an existing design often only varies , to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , Text@@ ign@@ ity Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ compiled the historic snow @-@ top .
put the machine in some places small ch@@ icks .
the Pl@@ au@@ ger gold@@ smith stalli@@ on master H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ che has inspired him : &quot; before , I could not start with the traditional flat . &quot;
now they are using the snow tip for their jewelry .
in a complex process , it shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ger - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also takes place in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in places and surroundings and who would like to remember the memory .
so I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the pl@@ unger tip .

XI constra@@ ined to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open wider past to bro@@ ader public to promote growth , &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping at the Tuesday of a group in charge of the reform .
&quot; in China it should be deplo@@ ying to increase foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business decisions , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central leadership group for the pro@@ found@@ ly of a comprehensive reform .

the guide group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity on the control of the market , relaxation of the border controls , encour@@ aging the state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and re@@ collect the residents of the detector .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified not to question the investments in question .
the system is tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance , since it points to the market a larger role in the allocation of resources , a legally independent company environment that is designed and the market said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government is also inviting the controls the businesses with regard to the companies , and make sure that companies decide how they perform their business .

EU wants to double Qu@@ at@@ cury limit on car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in huge pre@@ dat@@ ors , by doing a significantly higher dose of nervous .
the Food organization F@@ ood@@ ey , which is an appropriate working draft in the EU , criti@@ ci@@ zing big plans : &quot; risks and side effects were lacking in industrial and environmental policy , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ ey .
in addition , Wolf@@ sch@@ midt allegedly is intended for major fish reaching for major fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai@@ yan or S@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; cultivated security &quot; by one kilogram of fish per kilogram of fish .
big birds of prey , however , are already heavily loaded with mer@@ cury . on the basis of currently existing limit values , around 50 percent of fish money have to be sold .
according to the mar@@ g@@ inal limits , only 14.5 % would be completely compens@@ ated .
in return for this loos@@ ing , the EU wishes to open the EU according to F@@ ood@@ le - the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kilogram .
but Per@@ ood@@ ey said it but &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller dove on how car@@ p usually will suffer as low , that they already keep the planned maximum values already today .
the ab@@ dic@@ ation of the cl@@ one is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ance of de@@ fle@@ ction which is assi@@ sts in the economy , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mer@@ cury is a highly po@@ ison@@ ous metal heavy metal , which is strongly connected over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
the German Federal Government should be warned that &quot; small quantities especially may cause the damage of the nervous system already in small quantities .
the Federal Ministry of Environment announced on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values however , that &quot; health concern of the general population &quot; could not be expected .
mer@@ cury gets rid of everything by coal @-@ burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Agency , the German coal plants will lead to the Green @-@ Bundestag to grant more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in year , while two third of the population that are em@@ itted in Germany were em@@ itted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish around Elbe , Rhine and Danube has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel released from this paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European war@@ nings mainly sl@@ ated on mer@@ cury in fish is already certi@@ fying the most frequently reported health risks in the EU safety system RA@@ S@@ FF .
