it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) as a solution for inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a inj@@ ector solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . effective thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things , which are not present ) , mis@@ str@@ ust and remin@@ ders ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorders , a psych@@ ic illness , in which patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods of abnormal uter@@ us ) altern@@ ate with periods normal .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used for treatment in moderate to serious man@@ is@@ odes and prevention of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have been addressed to the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for quick control of increased uncertain@@ ty or behavi@@ oral disorders if the oral medication is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or processed cheese tablets in patients with the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who use other medicines , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be removed , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adapted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to one another .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a lower size as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine to play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also helps to norm@@ alize the brain activity , thereby reducing the brain activity , making psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , preventing the symptoms and was investigated in three studies up to a year .
the effectiveness of injection solution has been compared to two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in increased uncertain@@ ty , compared with a period of two hours .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was deployed to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in a different study conducted the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo which had been stabil@@ ising on 160 patients in which the man@@ ian symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the alter@@ ation of the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
in addition , the company also led studies to investigate , such as the body the melting of tablets and the solution to un@@ absor@@ bing ( decre@@ ases ) .
in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly stronger reduction in symptoms and patients who received placebo .
during the application of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy has reduced A@@ bili@@ fy in four of five short @-@ term studies and more effective than placebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented even up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the re @-@ appearance of Man@@ ic Ep@@ is@@ odes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses are also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased uncertain@@ ty and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ id@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , v@@ om@@ ile ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ p@@ ation ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ p@@ ation ( elevated ali@@ va ) , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( elevated ali@@ va ) , fatigue and ex@@ haus@@ tion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating sch@@ izophren@@ ia and severe serious epis@@ odes at bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder and in the prevention of a new one episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic epis@@ odes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
Moreover , the Committee resulted in the result that the benefits of injection solution in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable for the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . an approval for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate @-@ heavy epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for prevention of a new one episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ian epis@@ odes and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , daily regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors jus@@ ti@@ fies this ( see section 4.4 ) .
when the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the arith@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing of anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of the epidemi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder showed no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used to treat patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disorders , conditions that are used for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , treatment with blood pressure inhib@@ itor ) or hypertension ( including ak@@ zel@@ ew@@ ed and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

when patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to occur signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ n@@ esis , should be drawn into consider@@ ations , reduce the dose or decrease the treatment .
when a patient was developed and symptoms that point to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be removed .
hence , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be in connection with cr@@ abs in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with resi@@ du@@ es that are associated with cr@@ abs in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased death risk compared to placebo .
there was however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the promise for un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic activity , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no accurate risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related wanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic activity patients treated with direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the application of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is observed as a supplementary effect , resp@@ iration and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to the central nervous system , be careful if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alized pharmaceutical products ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist is Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with a healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhib@@ itor ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore , similar dose reductions should be performed .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can be combined common use with highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma cent@@ ering of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y into consideration , the potential benefit should predomin@@ ate potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ants , should have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions .
after applying the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhib@@ itors the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height prior to beginning of supporting therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ u@@ op@@ em or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be said to notify your doctor , when pregnant or pregnant women , during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the in@@ adequate data for security in human beings , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit jus@@ ti@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , like other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be war@@ ned , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to use , until they are safe , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it .
the following adverse events occurred frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the above mentioned side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
bi@@ polar Ep@@ is@@ odes at bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorders - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % was observed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term acceptance period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo was treated .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the routine sector , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic treated patients were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ surgery syndrome , late @-@ cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events , and increased mortality rate in elderly dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or un@@ inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages were observed in adult patients with estimated doses ranging from up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a cause .
although there are no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of a over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is in@@ likely that hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis has resulted in treating a over@@ dose of benefits because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma bond .
it is believed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole at sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder occurs on the combination of a particip@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ s recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a fresh aff@@ inity to Dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , for the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ees and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors .
in gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily , the Pos@@ it@@ ons @-@ Emission @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ ed dependent of binding 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor lig@@ n@@ ment , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statistically significant greater improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a week 52 the proportion of response to the study was observed in week 52 of response to the study medi@@ ation included in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ sign@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , NSC pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of decline , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational twin @-@ blind study of sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 314 patients included in the primary study destination &apos; weight gain &apos; ( N = 18 or 13 % of the out@@ patient patients ) in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dose over 3 weeks with patient or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo over placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patient or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo .
in two Plac@@ ebo@@ ar@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic tra@@ its , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a positive effect compared to placebo for a combination of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also proved a comparable share of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic re@@ mission of Man@@ ie based on such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 6 weeks with patient or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , the supporting therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed up against placebo during a stabili@@ zing phase before placebo for prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ drop , mainly for prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se .

the average elim@@ ination @-@ life time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , including a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients no sexually dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics had no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the influence of smoking based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic qualities of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not enough to isol@@ ate slaugh@@ ter to their metab@@ olic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , m@@ yc@@ otox@@ icity and the re@@ frac@@ tory potential , the pre@@ clinical data set no special haz@@ ards for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only during doses or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects includes a dos@@ sier @-@ dependent ad@@ ni@@ otic membrane ( AU@@ C ) of 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .
furthermore , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the exter@@ mination of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates to hydro@@ xy@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys to a repe@@ atable oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 .
however , in the human race at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , hydro@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were not found at least 6 % of the concentrations , which were determined in the study above 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ub@@ ility .

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and A@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in symptoms concerning placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean follow @-@ up of the initial improvement on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ imer Component reached in the primary 2 @-@ hour final point , 5.8 to placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe A@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness , a similar efficacy was observed in terms of overall population , but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statistically significant greater improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a week 52 the proportion of response was observed in week 52 of the response of the patient &apos;s response to the study medi@@ ation included in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational twin @-@ blind study of sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 314 patients involved and in the primary study destination &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , the supporting therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study @-@ extension in man@@ ic patients , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed up against placebo during a stabili@@ zing phase , with regard to placebo for prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ drop , mainly when prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C after the gift of the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , and resulted in any direct tox@@ icity of a target system after repeated administration of a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular .
in studies on the re@@ productive tox@@ icity after intraven@@ ous application , no security @-@ relevant concerns were found according to mat@@ ernal exposure , 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity and for the re@@ frac@@ tory potential , the pre@@ clinical data set no special haz@@ ards for humans .

the efficacy of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study , who participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously reported anth@@ rac@@ yc@@ line .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines ( in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of the patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
considering only patients that were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference in drug indicators such as time until deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously obtained other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be applied when patients are applied , or before the start of the treatment of low neut@@ rop@@ hi@@ des in the blood .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane had no longer contained medicines , effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drug may not be given in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines with other medicines must not be reduced to decrease side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Bio@@ Science Limited approval for the placing of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic breast cancer is failed and not indicated for standard anth@@ rac@@ yc@@ line @-@ containing therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .

with sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ ie level 3 , treatment is to break until an improvement in degrees 1 or 2 is achieved , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data to the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended to use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data for in@@ conc@@ ub@@ ility and effectiveness .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is a real @-@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which might have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be induc@@ ted immediately and treated sy@@ mptom@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .

patients with heavy liver function ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
while associated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in connection the car@@ di@@ otox@@ icity in the inde@@ xed group of patients are not unusual , especially in patients with previously untreated anth@@ rac@@ yc@@ line treatment or underlying cardi@@ ac disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the administration of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ eti@@ ka and cont@@ empl@@ ating means .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant or women in low @-@ hardness age that do not use effective conception , except the treatment of Mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is indispensable .

male patients who are treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is stim@@ ulated , during and up to six months after treatment no child will bear witness .
male patients should be advised before treatment over a sperm reservation , since the therapy with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane has the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very common ) and diz@@ zin@@ ess ( frequent ) , which can affect traffic and ability to serve machinery .
the following are the most common and most important events of side effects , which occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al Phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane and was he@@ avier in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .

the application of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ restriction studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , which was given a dose of 175 mg / m2 in the form of an in@@ fusion with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entr@@ e study carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 for a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation of allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a affected general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only adj@@ uv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ al@@ asia and adj@@ uv@@ ant treatment .

the natural history of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to Bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmaceutical market of the total @-@ P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute intervals of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 @-@ 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the active effect ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After an intraven@@ ous gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma tor@@ ation took effect on multi @-@ phase cells .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive external distribution and / or turn@@ out connection of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic qualities of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metab@@ oli@@ zed with two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic mamm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma , mean value for cum@@ ulative loss of less than 1 % of the specified total dose with less than 1 % of metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .

in case of patients with normal blood levels , it could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , if the procedure is not possible , in case of which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected .
treatment with se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which is displayed for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to leave blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be done by the patient or its responsible person , if they have received an appropriate manual .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be controlled prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency should be administered during the treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia could be caused by an Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body is not sufficiently respon@@ ding to body &apos;s own Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ie@@ tin .

Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to an injection in a v@@ ene in the framework of a main study of 479 patients who suffered an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared to reference professional .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , before they were treated either to Ab@@ se@@ amed or still E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indic@@ ative of the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ d values between the beginning of the study and the reference period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
Moreover , the company also laid down the results of a study in which the effects performed by the skin @-@ coated Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study , patients suffering from kidney problems caused ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were treated at intervals , in the same measurements , as in those patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common adverse effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , occasionally about symptoms of cep@@ halopath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as su@@ dden , ru@@ ined mig@@ rant head@@ ache and per@@ plex@@ ity .
Ab@@ se@@ amed cannot be applied in patients , possibly excessive sensitive ( allerg@@ y ) against epoxy or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed than inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , because further studies are required to ensure that this is not allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Ab@@ se@@ amed has provided evidence of evidence according to the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficiency profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients can occasionally be observed with an individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ d values , or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ der should be tried by a corresponding dose management , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be reached .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ der exceeds more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or when the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ der is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ och @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ ig@@ tin al@@ fa canc@@ eled at the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ emia and an@@ es@@ ome symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

in patients who are intended for an extensive orthop@@ edi@@ c enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ment , the cause of the an@@ emia was examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of the ep@@ och @-@ al@@ fa surgery .
patients who received a major orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ ose@@ proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , because they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and v@@ ascular disorders , especially in an initial cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded because of treatment with Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative / vas@@ cul@@ ine events .

as the active ingredient in acet@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ lat@@ a was used for the assessment of ac@@ ry@@ a .
in the first study , almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis was involved , and the number of ver@@ teb@@ ral and hat@@ s was investigated for a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had been recently a gu@@ ardian angel ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was investigated .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ reli@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indic@@ t@@ ator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that decreased bone sub@@ stan@@ z ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ inal ( without oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) with those of placebo the risk of bo@@ ilers was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip t@@ inc@@ ture 9 % of the patients had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of ac@@ complic@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ reli@@ a must not be applied in patients who are possibly obes@@ ity ( allerg@@ y ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other components .

patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) If patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended because limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ reli@@ a is not recommended to use in children and adolescents under 18 years , since data are missing for in@@ conc@@ ub@@ ility and effectiveness .
Ac@@ reli@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since the population population has only limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ an@@ emia is intended to treat the therapy with acet@@ one through sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid deteri@@ oration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure you can develop a temporary , with sy@@ mptom@@ atic mort@@ g@@ emia which usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ ry@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .

kidney function of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents has been associated with kidney dysfunction ( i.e. an increase in serum levels ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure , in connection .
the creation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually on administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to placebo group and placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed with acet@@ one treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory reag@@ ents , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were treated below the normal threshold range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ bo@@ a in a large clinical study enrolled in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ Studien .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical frac@@ tures after a hat@@ ching and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a recent unc@@ irc@@ um@@ eration inc@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ably measured , however , the majority of patients had an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of acet@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion place , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the oral area of Occa@@ sions , especially in cancer patients , on oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the oral zone ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .

in case of over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant mort@@ gage may be achieved by a gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficiency and safety of ac@@ ron@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was diagnosed with either a bone di@@ ver@@ gence or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ri@@ ver@@ teb@@ rate .
effects on morph@@ ic ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a significantly increased over a period of three years as well as for a year the frequency of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ complic@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for sp@@ inal bo@@ frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ bur@@ a reported a constant effect over three years that resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for bo@@ ft@@ frac@@ tures .

Kno@@ ch@@ enh@@ ist@@ ology If 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with ac@@ complic@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were collected a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es .
in comparison to placebo a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed a decrease of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and ob@@ taining the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum levels were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients during periods of time .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of acet@@ one reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline value and was kept at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in patients treated with the group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the acet@@ ate treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at all time points .
the Ac@@ t@@ ens@@ a treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment for an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total amount and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as .
clinical efficacy in males In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized to 508 men and evaluated the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % in acet@@ one @-@ treated males compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the annual administration of ac@@ complic@@ a was related to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in comparison to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ wir@@ l @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone activation was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radical Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold until 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper limit for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison with taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily was detected in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results after 6 months a similar decrease of pain and pain impact was observed compared with the initial value for ac@@ complic@@ a and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients that were classified by the end of the six @-@ month main study as the response of the therapy ( to the therapy ) could be enrolled in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with ac@@ complic@@ a and 107 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , patients that were treated with ac@@ complic@@ a , compared with 71 who treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients treated with a mean term of postoperative follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .
in 64 patients 15 and 15 minutes , in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ sier independent .
after that , the plasma cutting rose rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ st@@ anz@@ ine , called Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus pass of the bone .
removable blood levels of sex hormon@@ es , mainly est@@ rogen , that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus pass , bone structure takes place too fast , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , which weak@@ ens the bone material less than normal .
ac@@ complic@@ a works to norm@@ alize the bone structure again , holding a normal bone formation and therefore gives strength to the bones again .
if you are in dental treatment or under@@ going dental surgery you need to inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ ry@@ a .
at application of Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or n@@ ursing staff when you use other medicines / apply or used , even if it is subject to prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know whether you are taking medicines , of which they will damage the kidneys .
with food and drinks , you should be concerned with food and drinks , that you take in accordance with the instructions of your doctor , sufficient liquid before and after treatment with ac@@ complic@@ a .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Financial Stat@@ ements Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies to obtain recommendations on the application of medicines .
activation is applied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It may not be used in patients ( in particular over@@ weight patients ) . • It can be used together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medicine ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) can be applied using met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose cannot be satisfactory .
in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl hard foam or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or ins@@ ulin can be maintained , except for patients with h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sulph@@ ide @-@ resin or ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin is better toler@@ ated and the blood sugar level falls to better adjust type 2 diabetes .
for more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acet@@ ate in tri@@ ple@@ therapy were examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl hard filler , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lo@@ wering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value , which allows blood glucose in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ ine and a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ material showed in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of placebo caused by a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ ate and ins@@ ulin at 289 patients were examined , the patients receiving the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo in addition to placebo .
the most common side effects in connection with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used either in patients who may react sensitive ( allerg@@ y ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ a ( high level mirror - aci@@ d@@ ble levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients in cases where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for placing accounts within the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also displayed for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient and in@@ appropriate in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are endanger@@ ed at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardi@@ ac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , doctor should start treatment with lowest available dose and increase the dose in stages .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or eye @-@ de@@ es , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and furn@@ aces , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular study involving Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure occurred , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of liver disease must not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes are as soon as possible .
if a patient was developed which point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , tor@@ n@@ ness , fatigue , appeti@@ te , and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver enzymes .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued , should be guided by the clinical assessment of the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been demonstrated a dos@@ si@@ dependent weight gain , which can stir in fat deposits and connected in some cases with a liquid re@@ tention .
as a result of a ha@@ em@@ ic di@@ lution , the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has a minimal reduction in the central hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and with a l@@ esser extent even in patients under sulph@@ ide resin and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity , patients receiving Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ent or as two @-@ way combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ sier related p@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the introduction of the introduction of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , about a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is unc@@ le@@ ar if there are a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ ons , however , doctors should be aware of visual acuity , if patients suffering from distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be taken into consideration .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of noti@@ fying adverse events concerning frac@@ tured , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
the calculated fra@@ ction incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative med@@ ull@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for investig@@ ating cardiovascular events , represented frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative med@@ ull@@ ation .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or res@@ etting the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the examination of interactions were shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one had no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical @-@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , Cyc@@ los@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fib@@ ro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhib@@ itor ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one for 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( an cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ulin emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance in pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .

they lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refra@@ ction of the lens as they can also be observed in other h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one about three times the upper limit of the standardization area , however , often referred to as in placebo , but more rarely than in comparative cases under met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ ide @-@ resin .
in a Out@@ come study in patients with previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of a serious heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under placebo , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch , rarely about her@@ nia @-@ suff@@ iciency has been reported under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more frequently when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has been used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
there was a summar@@ izing analysis of noti@@ fying adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with previously treated medi@@ co @-@ treated groups .
over a period of 3.5 years of running Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
for taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , after 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) prolifer@@ ation , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose analysis in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ dic than mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time up to leave the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , blood glucose monitoring could be maintained ( as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one for 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were dis@@ continued with ins@@ ulin delivery due to ins@@ ulin delivery , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - a value of 0.@@ 45 % , compared with the patients who continued only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction in the ins@@ ulin dose treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small age on 18 weeks in type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , placebo was significantly reduced in comparison to placebo a reduction of CO2 @-@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as a slightly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid , the total plas@@ tific@@ ate gly@@ co@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in comparison to placebo , a statistically significant increase in LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel was detected in comparison to placebo during met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des , but also improved tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des level , which provides both a effect on tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de @-@ Absor@@ ption than also on hep@@ atic Tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were randomised in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
according to oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is rapidly res@@ or@@ ated , whereby the peak concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one can be reached in the plasma in a period of 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about the three times of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical @-@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

following the application of radioactive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans the mar@@ ker was mainly found in the drums ( 55 % ) and to a l@@ esser extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the medium plasma @-@ elim@@ ination half life of un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is about 5 @-@ 6 hours , while the entire active metabol@@ ites is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plasma tor@@ rent of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy volunteers with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects , but res@@ emble the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s Clear@@ ance .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , after repeated plasma volume with hem@@ or@@ atory , an@@ emia , and reversible heart hyper@@ t@@ rophy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to breast cancer , thereby reducing the availability of metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased in@@ depen@@ dencies of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the bladder .
in an animal model of family @-@ specific poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces led to an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ res .

the calculated fra@@ ction incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative med@@ ull@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for investig@@ ating cardiovascular events , represented frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative med@@ ull@@ ation .
in another study of two years , the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de mirror , which gives both a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ Gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d @-@ Absor@@ ption than also on hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d should not be applied in patients who may be sensitive to ins@@ ulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ pi@@ d may be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can inter@@ act on blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for placing Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
when two types of ins@@ ulin is mixed , first the amount of ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin must first be raised , then the amount of the long @-@ acting ins@@ ulin .
3 If alter@@ ing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in patients a dose adjustment is required , this will be necessary during the first dose or months after changing .
prior to trips that go over several time zones , the patient must take on to obtain the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to other times and have to be taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration site occasion@@ al - local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction regarding ins@@ ulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitive interactions ( red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma on injection ) may occur .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always be gra@@ pe gra@@ pe fruit juice , cand@@ y , bis@@ cu@@ its or sugar @-@ fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or administered by a proven aid of glucose , administered intraven@@ ously through the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for treating hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who had significantly reducing surgical interventions ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working time is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours , while the overall duration is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was investigated at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and youth ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited , however , assum@@ ption that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in concentrations of 0,05 % sodium chloride , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D glucose acid with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chloride are stable at room temperature for 24 hours .
11 If alternating to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in patients a dose adjustment is required , this will be necessary during the first dose or months after changing .
prior to trips that go over several time zones , the patient must take on to obtain the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to other times and have to be taken at other times .
13 General diseases and complaints at the administration site Occa@@ sional - Local overhau@@ l reaction regarding ins@@ ulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitive interactions ( red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain@@ s and hem@@ at@@ oma at injection ) may occur .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ ons , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or dist@@ rac@@ tions ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater primi@@ tive cryst@@ alli@@ zation that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
for two to four weeks , if the ur@@ inary system is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg daily .
during the first treatment months , g@@ aps may occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients will take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic for further medicines for prevention of exposure .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation , because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to placebo ( pseud@@ o @-@ medication ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day .
the main indic@@ ative for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract levels was under 6 mg / dl at the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patient , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic received a dose of 80 mg per day , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily tot@@ alling 120 mg per day , for the last three measurements of the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , and none of 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart defects in pre@@ history , an increased risk of certain side effects , affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was effective at the lo@@ wering of the ur@@ inary tract in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases which have already led to ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ings ( including one of the n@@ ursing history known or currently available ) .
if the serum ir@@ res@@ is@@ ance is still used for 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , the efficacy and safety has not been fully investigated ( cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Da there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
there are no experiences yet with organ transplan@@ ting , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ian heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ate heart failure is not recommended for treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ acid pharmaceuticals , it can occur during the treatment of acute lim@@ iting , because the lo@@ wering of serum har@@ le@@ d@@ aci@@ d@@ ations can be mobili@@ zed initially in the tissue .
B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ i Ny@@ han syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the ur@@ ine in rare cases occur so far that it comes to re@@ location in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease During the phase 3 clinical trials , light levels of liver function were observed with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function before beginning of the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ al treatment and in further development ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin Z@@ was done no interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhib@@ ition may lead to a rise in the ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ s ( an inhib@@ ition of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ) was also reported for other X@@ O inhib@@ itors ) .
in case of subjects , Avastin was associated with an increase of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ ide ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhib@@ itors does not stand in connection with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without having a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or at the same time connected other active substance .

Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a Ant@@ azi@@ one , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , contains the absorption of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) , however , causes no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies don &apos;t include side effects of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of fo@@ et@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when tax on a vehicle , to serve machines or when exercising dangerous activities , until they can be reas@@ on@@ ably safe that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC will not affect their performance .

the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study of patients with which the last three monthly cases of serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were included in the last three month .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum samples value of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT trial showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) in terms of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the decrease in serum levels at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed at the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintained permanently about the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney function reduction The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function reduction ( i.e. ) .
the AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of the percentage of serum @-@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl ( 40 % ) of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected data collected in two years showed that the lasting reduction in serum levels were observed ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , that less than 3 % of patients were required in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment against a layer of exposure ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients no treatment against a layer ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the coating size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the gy@@ ms up to the month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma cent@@ er@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma cent@@ er@@ line time ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ ines .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ ed proportional increase .
after taking simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts to approximately 2,8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of serum @-@ acid concentration , provided that this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at plasma coupling clamp is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary per@@ taining to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached via the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ ine@@ metab@@ oli@@ zation and ur@@ ine composition and are not relevant for clinical use as not relevant .
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fermentation and re@@ productive power of male and female rats .

the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones can brood @-@ ro@@ ig ) for women after menop@@ ause , where a risk of low vitamin D mirror exists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vitam@@ ine supplements ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie within 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
da Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 can be used separately from other medicines that are approved in the European Union , based on data from previous studies and published literature .
in addition , the company also carried out a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the percentage of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than those who had only Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate revenues ( 32 % ) .
in addition , the company also submitted data that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is required for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive apparatus such as abdominal pain , dy@@ ul@@ ence ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( cer@@ eal muscles ) , cer@@ v@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( swal@@ lowed ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( b@@ lowing stomach ) as well as aci@@ res .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other components can not be used AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be used in cases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ calc@@ ite ( low @-@ level mirror ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or use of pharmaceuticals ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and Vitam@@ ine supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to be precise to reduce the risk of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and thus linked to the side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be lu@@ stro@@ ked after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not cut the tablet into the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not be taken at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tic circ@@ us , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal blood or surgical interventions in the upper ro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , can be given only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
est@@ at@@ age reactions , such as Ö@@ n@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( sometimes these he@@ avier and required a hospital assignment ) .
the doctor should therefore asser@@ t attention to all of the signs and symptoms that arise out on possible les@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation , pain while swal@@ lowing or retro@@ fitted pain or re@@ im@@ itate so@@ ften or re@@ im@@ itate the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ icious side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not working properly and / or after the emer@@ gence of symptoms that are taken on a mal@@ os@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage securities must be disclos@@ ed to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

there are no data available to indicate whether the exp@@ ose of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a surgery surgical procedure to reduce the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the patient doctor is decisive for the therapeutic planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take on the tablet for taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets in the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the intended day of the week .
other ill@@ nesses that affect the mineral changes ( such as vitamin D deficiency and h@@ yp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ tism ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , Ant@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ ale drugs may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ act studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken together in clinical studies together with a wide range of usually driven medicines , without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor by prolonged women .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents kept to the BM@@ D of sp@@ ine and consol@@ ation persist@@ s ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ ian and the whole body was maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ controlled trials , at which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and after 10 mg were taken daily ( either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily gift of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least a new sp@@ inal inc@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

the bio@@ availability increased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0,@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at has taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients who transplan@@ t a kidney or liver to prevent di@@ vor@@ ce of transplan@@ tation by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been deployed in the EU , the company presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature .
furthermore , results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indic@@ ative of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ tation was dischar@@ ged by one year ( by example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , more clinical studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and analyzed , such as Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body as Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ ro@@ id antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f must not be used .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( in particular some vegetable ) medicines can be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the same medication may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation patients , should be prescribed or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ ting operations or to an increased incidence of side effects , including lower or over@@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dose ; Modification of formulation or regime should only be done under the close control of an experienced medicine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in succession of change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dos@@ ages must be carried out to ensure that system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of de@@ priv@@ ation and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommendations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dam should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after change@@ over .
on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposure was measured as valley mirror , with both wording both in kidney and superior patients .
careful and repeated insp@@ ections of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate im@@ transplan@@ tation phase .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low @-@ Clear@@ ance , can last several days , until the Ste@@ ady State is achieved .
if the state is not allowed to use medication in the first postoperative phase , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of approx .
duration of application to supp@@ ression of transplan@@ ting must be maintained ; consequently , the immune supp@@ ression must not be specified ; therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ ting phases The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
additional dos@@ ages may be required later , since the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ ting phases The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
Dos@@ age : change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be applied for a daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this change@@ over in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dosage .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change@@ over from other immune supp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , treatment with each treatment recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation recommended for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ ting .
heart transplan@@ t For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day .
other transplan@@ t receivers Ob@@ though there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ rat@@ f at lung , pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and dar@@ ken@@ transplan@@ t patients in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ t in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ ages in special patient groups with reduced liver function for maintaining blood levels in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function is no influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ otox@@ ic potenti@@ als of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful surveillance of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum levels of serum and monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f At the change@@ over from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley mirror in full blood , the dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of shock @-@ shock and toler@@ ability in individual case of full @-@ bloo@@ dy tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dam @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to perform common checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dam during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during the maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king mirror from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adjustment , changes of immune supp@@ ression therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the ste@@ ady state .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley mirror has not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and with gra@@ ci@@ zed patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ology , blood concentrations were generally used in the range from 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this caused serious adverse events , including transplan@@ ting rep@@ ul@@ sions or other side effects , which may occur in a row of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dose ; Modification of formulation or regime should only be done under the eng@@ ul@@ atory control of experienced medicine ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ting rep@@ ul@@ ent , which proved to be exhau@@ sting against other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va , do not exist any clinical data for ret@@ arded formulation .
in favour of the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ ting during an adult cardi@@ ac gra@@ ft , no clinical data for ret@@ arded formulation are not yet present .
for possible interaction , which can lead to a reduction of tac@@ tile mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , is the pill of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedy during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of tac@@ tile concentrations in the blood , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , aqu@@ eous humor or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ t@@ rophy was observed in rare cases , which may therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ id , hypertension , kidney function , infections , liquid up@@ loading and oils .
like with other immun@@ os@@ supp@@ ress@@ ants , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to proper clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protective factor .
when patients showing tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms , symptoms of por@@ res such as head@@ ache , changed consciousness levels , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces should demonstrate a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. , for example ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ert , l@@ act@@ ose contain special attention in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ paint absorption special caution .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medic@@ inal products that are known as inhib@@ itors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended to change tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels when changing the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction of anti@@ fung@@ us like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , and with the Macro@@ media antibio@@ tic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV @-@ prot@@ eas@@ ants ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the elevated oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhib@@ iting of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal contamination , resulted .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute de@@ duction reactions , can increase or lower concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are metab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , affecting metabolism .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us minim@@ ise the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus , the hormon@@ al exposure may be particularly careful with decisions on recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ o@@ bar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ tation patients provide no note that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us an increased risk for un@@ wanted events in regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns recommends the adverse effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially as regards its effect on the kidneys ) .

due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high binding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ c@@ ytes and plasma proteins can be accepted that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sing .
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ ological effects on molecular level can be convey@@ ed the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us through its binding to cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ish protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in cell @-@ cell@@ ars .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhib@@ ition of signal reduction because of the T cells and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain line of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a short@@ age of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood circulation ) .
the dosage and frequency of application are given after adv@@ ate for the treatment of ble@@ eding or prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical interventions .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ots such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but based on a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that was associated with a gene ( DNA ) that it is capable of promoting the human body factor VIII .
adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union , including Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but it contains different proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe until moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , was examined the application of pharmaceuticals for prevention of ble@@ eding as well as surgical interventions .
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ant@@ ages was given in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ is@@ odes with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are diz@@ zin@@ ess , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies towards factor VIII .
adv@@ ances may not be applied in patients , possibly excessive sensitive ( allerg@@ y ) against the human being factor VIII , Maus@@ ole@@ um or ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval for placing the marketing of Adv@@ ances throughout the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitutes may differ according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII deficiency , after the place and the degree of ble@@ eding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII activity should not drop under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
inj@@ ections repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the danger exists for the patient &apos;s risk .
during the treatment course , it is stim@@ ulated to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma tiles .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different sem@@ it@@ ones .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U@@ . by factor VIII a kg body weight within a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected amount of VIII plasma activities not be achieved or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled , a test must be carried out if necessary to inhib@@ itor a inhib@@ itor .
in patients with high inhib@@ itors , it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be avoided .
the allocation is to be determined after filling the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhib@@ itors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhib@@ itors have always been quanti@@ fied against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII and Ig@@ G im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk , inhib@@ itors to develop , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk occurs within the first 20 ex@@ positions on the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ ian @-@ known inhib@@ itors of In@@ hib@@ itors , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , re@@ occurrence of ( lowest ) inhib@@ itors .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
in the largest number of patients &quot; A@@ DR@@ s , inhib@@ itors were treated against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) that occur in previously untreated patients who have higher risk to formation of inhib@@ itors , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fever and diz@@ zin@@ ess ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data ) .

blood cl@@ ots was observed during the whole period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed again enough values on the 15 . postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic to moderate to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ) concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only a patient was presented with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhib@@ itor ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , at none of 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed he@@ avier than moderate to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure versus factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhib@@ itor .
previously untreated patients were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients based on contamination of proteins were analyzed by the investigation of antibody tit@@ ular against this protein , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient was shown in both a statistically significant up@@ dat@@ or against anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise , no indication of signs or symptoms occurred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the occurrence of ur@@ anium , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ ules were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As for other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported on over@@ sensitivity reactions from allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
this activated factor VIII acts as a co@@ factor for activ@@ ating factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the use of available data , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit risk provisions as a positive result , but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which required a filing of PS@@ UR@@ S every 6 months , the authorisation holder is to apply for another extension for 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited registered the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company takes on approval for the market entry of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , the breast , brain , bones , or turn@@ around ( tissues , the other structures in the body combines , surro@@ unds and support ) .
in this way , it is a type of virus that has been genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has changed no copies of themselves , and therefore no infections may trigger human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and to form the cancer cells , to form normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body of existing p@@ 53 gene , usually carries the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells continue to grow and share .
the company recorded data from a study of a study involving the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the realm of under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain .
after CH@@ MP the responses of the company had examined the questions , still some questions were un@@ explained .
based on the examination of the documents submitted , CH@@ MP provides a list of questions that sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP &apos;s view , the injection of Adv@@ ance in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours are advant@@ ageous for patients .
the Committee had further concerns relating to the processing of drug in the body , the way of administration and drug safety .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ance can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment , nor for people who come in in @-@ form contact with the patient .
the company was aware that CH@@ MP did not know whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered effect &quot; means that the tablets are thus assembled , that one of the effective components is immediately released , and the other slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by a allerg@@ y to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nostr@@ ils ) in patients with nose @-@ loop sw@@ elling ( viol@@ op@@ ed nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ mu@@ c@@ ous nose ( viol@@ op@@ ted nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of medicines can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measurements were the change of the sever@@ ity of the Heu@@ v@@ ens@@ hr@@ ome symptoms that were reported in patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients wor@@ e their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and valu@@ ate the symptoms in the last 12 hours .
considering all the hypo@@ cr@@ um@@ ens@@ hr@@ ome symptoms , besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported patients that aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze accounted for 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane , the patients showed an alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared with 26.@@ 7 % in patients who revenues des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( ob@@ serving at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) , nit@@ rous oxide , diz@@ zin@@ x@@ ie ( appeti@@ te in@@ action ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , ti@@ red@@ ness , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nia ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be non @-@ sensitive ( allerg@@ y ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseud@@ o @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ders active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for allergi@@ es ) are not used .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must not be applied in patients with hypertension ( hypertension ) , cardi@@ ac or vessel disease including hypertension ( hypertension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( over@@ function of thy@@ roid ) , or already a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( over@@ function of thy@@ roid ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted its SP Europe approval approval for the placing of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze of the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , if swal@@ lowed up ( i.e. without them to break down or cut them ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data to dis@@ comfort and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , since long @-@ term application can take the activity of pseud@@ o eph@@ ed@@ rin .
after drop in sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory because of the treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy .
because Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains , is the medicine also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhib@@ itors or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity combined with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ g@@ oli@@ d , Per@@ g@@ oli@@ d , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ em@@ tiv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rin , Oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s disease , and do not submit data to increase related recommendations for dosing .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function and do not submit data to increase related recommendations for dosing .
patients must be informed that treatment at the occurrence of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or ag@@ grav@@ ings , heart rhythm distur@@ ban@@ ces , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or gain of head@@ ache ) must be depos@@ ited .
in the treatment of the following patient groups : • patients with cardiovascular problems • patients with hypertension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must cover at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as Anti@@ hist@@ amine can prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce their dimensions .
in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in addition to path@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions were observed , however , were observed in the plasma tor@@ rent of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
in the results of the psychological tests , no significant differences could be detected between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and placebo patients , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme in@@ responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is not identified , so the interactions with other medicines could not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhib@@ its in @-@ vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate is an inhib@@ itor of the P @-@ glyc@@ op@@ rot@@ ein .
the harm@@ less@@ ness of application of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the pre@@ valence of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals don &apos;t always be transferred to humans and should not be used for pe@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseud@@ o con@@ stri@@ ed@@ rin .
however , patients should however be clari@@ fied that it may occur in very rare cases to a d@@ row@@ ness , which may result in impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ min@@ ed mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular col@@ li@@ qu@@ or ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ istics .
head@@ ache , anxiety , us@@ ability and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ al , breathing suff@@ iciency , heart rhythm distur@@ ban@@ ces , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thir@@ st , per@@ spiration , nau@@ sea , v@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ y , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces or h@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( oral drying , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ star@@ re and di@@ at@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhib@@ ition of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ il@@ en as well as the inhib@@ ition of the expression of the no@@ blem@@ s P @-@ Sel@@ tin to endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement variables including ampli@@ fication , subj@@ ective , or the tasks that are connected with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo was detected at the recommended dose of 5 mg .
the oral application of pseud@@ o eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
there were 1.@@ 248 patients aged between the ages of 12 and 78 with seasonal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis , 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total value for the sympt@@ om ( except nas@@ al grinding sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseud@@ o eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nose @-@ loop sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the framework of a single dose trial for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is distill@@ at@@ ad@@ in within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze at healthy subjects of 14 days , the flow @-@ balance of disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached in 10 days .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ sier study , which was conducted with formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects of disin@@ ter@@ at@@ ad@@ in po@@ or@@ ly cont@@ enti@@ ous .
a component @-@ inter@@ act study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseud@@ o @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , after the first gift of pseud@@ o @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , was the exposure to a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated administration , the tox@@ icity and reproduction of reproduction can be detected with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , however , no particular haz@@ ards for humans .
the combination had no longer tox@@ icity than their individual components , and observed effects were generally associated with the content of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ate studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 the regulatory approval system was established and works , before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the reli@@ eving of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , which can un@@ fold its own substance .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets left symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , like Ni@@ esen , running or it@@ ching eyes with con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive eyes in con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four trials in seasonal allerg@@ y and two studies on patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
further studies have been submitted to real@@ ise that the body absor@@ bs the sy@@ rup and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children are un@@ think@@ able .
with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us were given to an average decrease of the sympt@@ om score ( sympt@@ om score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decline of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the acceptance of the sympt@@ om scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % for patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients , possibly excessive sensitive ( allerg@@ y ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval approval for placing A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
a tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for reli@@ eving symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in youth from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be terminated according to the clinical symptoms and can be resum@@ ed once again after the symptoms of disease .
in the pers@@ ist allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the cost @-@ effective treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not reinforced with alcohol taking effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should not be clari@@ fied that it may cause d@@ row@@ ness in very rare cases , which may cause impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical studies in various indications , including allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic , at the recommended dose of 5 mg , 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported when patients treated with placebo .
the most frequently occurring adverse events that were reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , oral dryer ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse reactions were treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both inhib@@ ition of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ il@@ en as well as the inhib@@ ition of the expression of the no@@ blem@@ s P @-@ Sel@@ tin to endo@@ thel@@ eli@@ al@@ cells .
in a clinical study with multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of Q@@ T@@ c interval showed itself .
in a single dos@@ si@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement variables including ampli@@ fication , subj@@ ective , or the tasks that are connected with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ sec@@ re@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be classified as depending on the duration of symptoms or alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ acting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
as shown from the tot@@ ality of Question@@ naire at Rhin@@ o @-@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively di@@ min@@ ished , caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ aria was also examined for other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of offices in different forms , and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited quite prospective .
since the hist@@ amine faced a significant factor in all ur@@ tik@@ ari@@ al diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is expected to improve symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , in addition to improving the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , the minority of the patients who didn &apos;t react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , were excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ tering of more than 50 % of patients treated with disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients were observed compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variable .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients @-@ dem@@ ograph@@ ies were comparable with the common seasonal allergi@@ es -@@ population , a higher concentration of disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically important cum@@ ulation once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .

however , in children under 2 years of age , fever and ins@@ om@@ nia were frequent side effects during adults , ti@@ pping and head@@ ache more often than placebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for inser@@ tion is available in bottles with child @-@ safe sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially granted the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes on approval for the placing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used to protect adults and elderly people for protection against flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a stock of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus , which could cause future pan@@ demic .
an influenza attacks broke out , if a new strain of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus can be spread easily , because humans have not built any immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vaccine , the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corpor@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thereby , the immune system is able to form this regular antibody in contact with an influenza virus .
subsequently the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m surface , which detects the human body as physical ) , is cleans@@ ed , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thereby , the scope of the clinical data base does not support the safety of vacc@@ ines required to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines governing pre @-@ pan@@ demic vacc@@ ines .
if you participate in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .
if you wish to provide further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are infected with the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who could not swal@@ low capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase can be taken as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination has not been investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined the an@@ tivir@@ al medicine of the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has been as@@ sured that the virus is addressing the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is governed by the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood using other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
AIDS is not able to heal the damage of the immune system and hence the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , however without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which had previously been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants .
this o@@ gener@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had previously taken the former prot@@ ease inhib@@ itor .
the proportion of patients with non @-@ exist@@ ent concentrations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of viral load after the treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously used no prot@@ ease inhib@@ itor , after 48 weeks , more patients had a virus load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced vir@@ us@@ last , however , with the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhib@@ itor :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste from the vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhib@@ itor :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( ob@@ serves more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied in patients who may be sensitive to patients ( allerg@@ y ) against am@@ ob@@ avi@@ or or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are just like A@@ gener@@ ase , and are harmful to high concentrations in the blood of health .
like other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ o@@ unc@@ ro@@ sis ( causes of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of infection , which are caused by the recovery immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected adult patients and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee stated that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously been detected no prot@@ eas@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information templates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited approval for the marketing of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhib@@ itor ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ em@@ y of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r should be taking into consideration the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % less than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ is@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules can be applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses need to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pr@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ le@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not investigated in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data for in@@ conc@@ ub@@ ility and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should occur in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals , which possess a small therapeutic width and also constitute the sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enc@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) , may not be used because of the risk @-@ reduced plasma tor@@ rent and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r during taking Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy is not leading to cure HIV infection , and that they can continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prevents the risk of a transmission of HIV on others using sexual contact or contamination with blood .
A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver action with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the reference information of this medicine .
patients with existing limited liver function including chronic hepatitis using an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored accordingly to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ tia or other glu@@ co@@ tics , is not recommended that the potential benefit of the risk of system@@ ic corrupt effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ep@@ ni@@ otic dysfunction ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the adh@@ esion of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ ductor Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous appointments with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ o@@ bar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standard debt ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced plasma tiles ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metab@@ olic interactions with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be changed the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ental sympt@@ om , especially if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of a tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patients groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to duration 5 when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic reaction is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ants , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metab@@ olic disorders .
ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ en patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , are reports about an increase of ble@@ eding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis .
in the absence of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infections which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ t@@ orial Equ@@ al Equ@@ al ( including the application of Cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ id , alcohol consumption , severe immune supp@@ ression index ) , cases of oste@@ opor@@ osis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals , which possess a small therapeutic width and also constitute the sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enc@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with minor therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with pharmaceuticals , whose ingredients are mainly related to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , which are mainly connected with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
at an attempt to compens@@ ate for a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were observed very frequently undes@@ irable effects on the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient participates in the direction of Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ per@@ y mirror is possible and , if possible to check the vir@@ us@@ last and add the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
one dose adap@@ tion for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ av@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of am@@ o@@ bl@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily used for the efficacy and harm@@ less@@ ness of this treatment scheme .
in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 750 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ in@@ avi@@ r was administered twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved during the combination of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice a day .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended , as the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ ties of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the application of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended due to the ant@@ acids component of di@@ vor@@ os@@ ine , however , that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , the gift of ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is not necessary .
treatment with ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ant inhib@@ itors would be decreased .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ ease inhib@@ itor and existing limited data can be avoided that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin probably reduces the serum concentration of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r .
if this drug may be used simultaneously , because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced and potentially sub@@ therapeutic plasma tiles .
if this medicine is applied together , caution is offered ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be done , as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ mu@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plasma tor@@ rent ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and therefore associated with a rise in Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is given together with A@@ gener@@ ase , to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not carried out , however , the plasma tiles of both pharmaceuticals could be increased in the case of simultaneous appointments .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a daily basis compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without a simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhib@@ itor or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may be used together with A@@ gener@@ ase may lead to interactions together .
patients should therefore be associated with toxic reactions who are linked to these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it may cause res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ va that are known as an enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ o@@ bar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plasma tiles of Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r .
the serum levels of calcium @-@ channel blocks like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Israel di@@ pin , Nic@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ b @-@ pin , ni@@ b @-@ pin , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r 10 , thereby elimin@@ ating the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can increase its plasma @-@ centr@@ alized effects and increase of P@@ DE@@ 5 inhib@@ itors in the related side effects including h@@ yp@@ oten@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study that Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days to test subjects , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % conv@@ ex interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , together with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ tics , is not recommended that the potential benefit of the risk of system@@ ic corrupt effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itors like Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends strongly from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , increased enh@@ ancements in plasma tiles at the con@@ current administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since Plas@@ mas@@ p@@ bar increases this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itors including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of this drug is not recommended with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as well as stabilization of the mirror is recommended because the plasma cent@@ er@@ ations of Cyc@@ los@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by am@@ ni@@ o@@ ons ( see Section 4.4 ) .
hence , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied together with oral em@@ bal@@ em Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ oc@@ hib@@ itors indicate a possible increase in plasma tiles from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 to 4 foot .
if Meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r , therefore , patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ental sympt@@ om , especially if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to its low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given how the Am@@ it@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is to be administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ic anti @-@ an@@ tic@@ ul@@ ants , together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International standard of R@@ atio ) is recommended because of a short@@ com@@ ing or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , therefore , alternative methods for conception is recommended .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful elim@@ ination of possible use for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
Am@@ op@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected in the milk of lac@@ ing rats , however , it is not known whether am@@ o@@ bl@@ avi@@ r survived in human breast milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats who was administered by the inc@@ ur@@ sion into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during a down@@ time .
further development of income including fermentation and re@@ productive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s womb .
the harm@@ less@@ ness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase @-@ treatment were slightly until moderate , rising early , and performed rarely to treatment .
with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied , whether in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or if they are a result of mal@@ under disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which two @-@ treated patients had not treated 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .

the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) with HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripheral and fast fat tissue , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ al fat accumulation ( stem ) .
in 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons who had been treated with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in for a medium duration of 36 weeks , was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 84@@ A / L / V , I@@ 84@@ A / L / V , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of vi@@ rolog@@ ical contact ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation sm@@ s can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to utili@@ ze the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
in combination with prot@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analyses , phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations , phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations , phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations , phen@@ otyp@@ ical data can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otype data for the activity of am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that have diagnostic resistance tests have been developed in clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( partition points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpre@@ t results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r , but remains generally accepted .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistant between ammon@@ ium and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral vir@@ gins , a certain resistance against at@@ az@@ an@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ ca@@ vi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 ins@@ ats ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 Isol@@ ates ) .
vice @-@ vers@@ a , Am@@ op@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to observe the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which may affect the following treatment .
the receipt of the efficacy of as@@ le@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ anal@@ oga ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) , with a PI , predominantly with a minim@@ ised Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; received .
one hundred six@@ ty @-@ six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis posed by AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI @-@ Group with regard to the time @-@ adj@@ uv@@ ant average ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , in a non @-@ non @-@ law threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the receipt of the efficacy of un@@ b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in studies , A@@ gener@@ ase has been used for inser@@ tion and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg each day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily . the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was given at the same time , the majority of the patients treated with PI was given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on this data should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
according to oral administration , the mean duration is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the administration of Am@@ ru@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) of the food intake remained un@@ affected , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of the res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ interrupted penetration of the blood circulation in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r , which remains the active proportion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ ob@@ struc@@ tible Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r remain constant , fluctu@@ ating the percentage of free active ingredient during the met@@ ady @-@ concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss by C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drug , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induced or inhib@@ it a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , should be administered with caution if they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg each day , leads to a similar daily am@@ ni@@ ated exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ op@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available as from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is ne@@ gl@@ ected , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schemes carry on Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r Plas@@ mas@@ cot comparable to those who have been att@@ ained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ dr@@ avi@@ r twice daily without prior administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis of mice and rats at doses of mice and rats at dos@@ ages , the exposure of the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r , said .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ul@@ lar aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects for human beings is unc@@ le@@ ar .
however , from the present exposure data on people , both clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of this findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ genital tests , the bacterial reverse Mut@@ ation Test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test , micro @-@ core test of rats and chrom@@ os@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations were infected by human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ c@@ ytes , was am@@ id@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ in@@ otox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical routine using AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , in clinical studies , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in patients either during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase after the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity at young , who were treated at an age of 4 , showed a high mortality in both cases when treated with Am@@ op@@ avi@@ r animals .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significantly less than ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dose when humans lay , however , a number of minor changes , including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minimal sk@@ el@@ etal changes , were observed in a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules can be applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses need to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pr@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should occur in patients with weak or light liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ o@@ bar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standard debt ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be depos@@ ited for duration 27 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic reaction is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metab@@ olic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved during the combination of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice a day .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended , as the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ ties of this combination is not known .
treatment with ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ant inhib@@ itors would be decreased .
if this medicine is applied together , caution is offered ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be done , as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is given together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose , at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data .
the serum levels of calcium @-@ channel blocks like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Israel di@@ pin , Nic@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ b @-@ pin , ni@@ b @-@ pin , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r , benef@@ iting the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
in a clinical study that Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days to test subjects , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % conv@@ ex interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ic anti @-@ an@@ tic@@ ul@@ ants , together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International standard of R@@ atio ) is recommended because of a short@@ com@@ ing or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of Eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ thin@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful elim@@ ination of possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats who was administered by the inc@@ ur@@ sion into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ it@@ avi@@ r was revealed during the n@@ ursing time a reduced increase in body weight .
the harm@@ less@@ ness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of a over@@ dose , the patient was observed at the signs of a tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting actions .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ c@@ ytes .
the 50 % inhib@@ ition of inhib@@ ition ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r is affected by 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
vice @-@ vers@@ a , Am@@ op@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , with PI pre @-@ treated benefit of expected benefit from &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ ob@@ struc@@ tible Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r remain constant , fluctu@@ ating the percentage of free active ingredient during the aggreg@@ ate concentration in the ste@@ ady state on the range of C@@ max , ss by C@@ min , ss :
therefore , drug , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induced or inhib@@ it a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , should be administered with caution if they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r also is ne@@ gl@@ ected ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis of mice and rats at doses of mice and rats at dos@@ ages , the exposure of the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to human beings twice daily .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ ron@@ eous aden@@ om@@ es and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects for human beings is unc@@ le@@ ar .
however , out of the present exposure data on people , both clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of this findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ genital tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test , micro @-@ core test of rats and chrom@@ os@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations , was Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , neither m@@ yc@@ otox@@ ic .
studies on tox@@ icity at young , who were treated at an age of 4 , showed a high mortality in both cases when treated with Am@@ op@@ avi@@ r animals .
these results indicate that in young , the metabolism of metabol@@ ites are not fully mature , so that am@@ o@@ bl@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhib@@ itor ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion was neither associated with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % less than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should end as soon as they are able to swal@@ low capsules , taking the solution to the inser@@ tion solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg of am@@ o@@ bl@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation should be given for the simultaneous use of as@@ generic solution to inser@@ tion and low @-@ de@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in combination with these patients .
although a tin adap@@ tion for Am@@ op@@ avi@@ r is not necessary to be necessary , an application of as@@ le@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl gly@@ col@@ ge@@ ant , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is for inser@@ ting young children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive inhib@@ ition of the metabol@@ isation of this drug and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects like heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy is not leading to cure HIV infection , and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent risk 47 of a transfer from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ o@@ bar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standard debt ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to duration if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic reaction is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with pharmaceuticals 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metab@@ olic disorders .
ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ en patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , are reports about an increase of ble@@ eding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ un@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase its plasma @-@ centr@@ alized effects , including P@@ DE@@ 5 inhib@@ itors , including h@@ yp@@ oten@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhib@@ itors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is significantly higher for plasma shi@@ fts from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for human beings is not known as A@@ gener@@ ase solution may not be used due to possible toxic reactions of fo@@ et@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col in pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
Am@@ op@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected in the milk of lac@@ ing rats , however , it is not known whether am@@ o@@ bl@@ avi@@ r survived in human breast milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats who was administered by the inc@@ ur@@ sion into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 55 body weight .
the harm@@ less@@ ness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied , whether in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or if they are a result of mal@@ under disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - such as prot@@ rac@@ ted treatment schemes - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .

the applic@@ ability and duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depends on the treatment of Al@@ dar@@ a , up to a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , the cream is charged twice a week , during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the cycles of therapy , three times a week .
in front of bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected skin surfaces , so that it remains enough ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before they washed .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indi@@ ces for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete separation of treated warm . • Al@@ dar@@ a was investigated in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks or placebo either daily or five times a week .
main indic@@ ative for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete separation of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in total 505 patients with ak@@ t@@ ine ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts expressed in genital disease , the results of both studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma showed a complete inc@@ ur@@ inary rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( ob@@ serves more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair ring was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions takes place in general during therapy or reactions to the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment can be made of several days .
the clinical result of the therapy can be evaluated for approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of treated skin .
there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months after treatment available , should be drawn in super@@ natural bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma and other appropriate therapy forms .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs are no clinical experiences yet , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .

there are only very limited information on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ants in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis on the sub @-@ arms and hands will not support the effectiveness in this application purpose , therefore a such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally take over the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after receiving the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reactions to the patient cause large dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment can be suspended for a few days .
from data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 Ak@@ les@@ ions have resulted in a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .

the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults aged 65 years was not determined , and for this patient does not recommend any dosage scheme .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as each in the related side effects , which occurs during fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also remain eng@@ m@@ asch@@ ig , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be in a reasonable clinical field , in which res@@ us@@ ability for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , almost all patients can form Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment of treatment .
patients that develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution in application of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , it must be c@@ auti@@ ous due to the theoretical increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .

100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients there occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ sig@@ net , most of the patients under 5 years with a severe de@@ bit version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( and up to a premature retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had not been det@@ ectable by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ aci@@ cip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay demonstr@@ able antibodies , among them 3 patients with which it never came to serum .
patients with lack of low @-@ antibody mirror showed a robust reduction of the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , while patients with high antibody tit@@ res to set a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal until small neutr@@ alising inhib@@ it@@ oral effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ al activity in vitro , which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies appeared not to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable medicines typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the jus@@ tification for the enzyme therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of an accumulation of accumulation of enzymes .
after an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omen , the most prob@@ able via Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study was investigated for 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were recru@@ ited from the mean phen@@ otype , and only a patient reported the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ c@@ apped exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters to go .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy was the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute route in the 6 @-@ minute moments .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients to the placebo group showed an improvement of the lung function and the ability to be displayed in the following table .
in the open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the acceptance of the FE@@ V &apos;s expected increase in terms of this period is clin@@ ically significant and the absolute pul@@ ch@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a hepatitis atomic treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ ag mirror at the Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was determined until the end of the study remained constant .
with regard to the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifest@@ ation between patients that summar@@ izes clin@@ ically significant changes in five efficacy variable ( up to expected , percentage of shoul@@ ders for five patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
there was a one year @-@ old open phase 2 study carried out mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were enrolled at the time of their inclusion in the study below 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe de@@ bit ) and 4 patients ( mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased because of elevated G@@ AG@@ - mirrors in the Har@@ n in week 22 of the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with mean follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with mean follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form is considered limited or even no progress in co@@ gni@@ tive development .
in a phase 4 study , examinations on pharmac@@ ic dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dock schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks , the difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions may constitute an acceptable alternative , but is not proven that long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two doses are equal .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will assess any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the Sum@@ mary of the Charac@@ ter@@ istics will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to those in older and less strongly affected patients .

preparation of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me In@@ fusion ( with as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • J@@ e after body weight of the individual patients initially determine the number of cylinders to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who cannot be stretched out to other parts of the body , or is likely to spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used to treat patients previously not treated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously used other chem@@ o@@ therapies compared to several therapy .
to decrease side effects , patients during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta should have cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with cis@@ pl@@ atin , or after the administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( drug against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid man@@ gel ) .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or where specific side effects occur , the treatment should be lowered or reduced .
consequently , the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is easier to out@@ fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of medic@@ inal and longer duration of cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ ke , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study enrolled 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously treated with chemotherapy was compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9,3 months of initial administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received a chemotherapy , the average survival compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell count , with the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta prolonged survival times than with a comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. approved approval for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow bottle needs to be raised with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which yields a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ sis is extracted and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic melan@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is displayed for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment course .
to reduce the frequency and heav@@ iness of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ Gift and the day after treatment was given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ id .
during the seven days prior to the first dose , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire duration of therapy as well as for another 21 days following the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ mixed dose as well as for every third cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood image should be created before every gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ c@@ yte story .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose @-@ inspection must take place under the note of N@@ adi@@ rs and the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre @-@ h@@ aired therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to critics in the 1 , 2 and 3 tables , which apply for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC @-@ 2 blood circulation .
if patients don &apos;t develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 ( excluding neur@@ otox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient must decrease the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if patients after 2 dos@@ ages or hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so - at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ otox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , compared to patients aged 65 years , an increased by adverse reactions .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data for in@@ conc@@ ub@@ ility and effectiveness .
in clinical studies , patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not need dose adjustments that are recommended for all patients recommended .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of below 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function of &gt; 1.5 times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values ( with metast@@ ases of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) was not specifically investigated in studies .
patients must be monitored and P@@ em@@ etry must not be administered in patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ar@@ um reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ at@@ ric number of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ar@@ age , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ds and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they have been observed in the previous treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was considered a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore , all patients with pellets are necessary to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ y@@ - l@@ actic measure for reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and minimum 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ etry ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time period must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ etry ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in a trans@@ cellular room a drainage of the flow in front of the pel@@ let @-@ mixed treatment should be avoided .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ed life dim@@ entation ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible cran@@ ial re@@ juven@@ ation by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be referred to before treatment - G@@ inn should be advised to obtain information regarding the sperm reservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oids ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced par position with a result of a higher distribution of effects .
therefore , caution is required if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and minimum 2 days after the therapy with pellets ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data concerning the editorial potential as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the inf@@ ant status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti @-@ an@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International standard of R@@ atio ) when the patient was taken to treat patients with oral anti @-@ an@@ tic@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as in anti @-@ de@@ - anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected to be severe birth defects during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful elim@@ ination of use for the mother and risk of risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible effects of re@@ productive capacity due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment of treatment , advice on the sperm cells .
it is not known as P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in breast milk and un@@ wanted effects on the breast@@ feeding inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and severe adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om and random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , which received random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin in mon@@ otherapy .

the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hangs with the pharmac@@ ological effects of pharmaceuticals , since the absorption of genom@@ es fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the skins are defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency on the basis of the available data ) .

over@@ weight has influence on your health and increases the risk of the emer@@ gence of various serious diseases such as : • hypertension • chronic canc@@ ers • oste@@ o@@ arthritis and your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example through improving the nutrition and more movement , can prevent the serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to eat permanently .
energy is also measured in kil@@ oj@@ oules which you can also find the recommended cal@@ orie intake as many calories you should take a maximum of calories per day .
notice the further below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
which quantity is suitable for you , see the number of calories , which is suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as so far , this means that your body can &apos;t process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ence to the recommended fat content , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and reduce the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of nutrition @-@ related supp@@ osi@@ tions . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to progres@@ sively lose weight and continually exp@@ ose about 0.5 kg a week without fru@@ str@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Ger@@ inge physical activity &quot; means that you can work only little or not go , stairs to work or other physical activities , i.e. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 minutes garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ ori@@ - and fat goals and also to keep them . • Do you make sense of food with information about cal@@ ori@@ - and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more , before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combined the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of further information materials which can help you feed oc@@ ori@@ - and fat @-@ induced , physical and physical .
in combination with respect to your type @-@ cut program to support weight loss , you can help you develop a heal@@ th@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , and with chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ols ( an medicines that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because the effects in this age group isn &apos;t enough information .
this means that the active ingredient preventing a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , preventing the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
for chem@@ o@@ therapies , strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the new trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
at a comparison with d@@ ag@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with strong em@@ akers , due to cancer disease and prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting patient chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ols .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ o@@ dar@@ age , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored according to injection moulding .
like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful when developing Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is prolonged or which tend to be such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , in the days of chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhib@@ it the five studied chemical therapeu@@ tics ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ mb@@ ab@@ in , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady concentration of or@@ ic Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhib@@ itors .
based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hib@@ itors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , Cel@@ ec@@ ox@@ ine , Sur@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Sur@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Sur@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Sur@@ ya , and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ s , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences about the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not necessary , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the doctor &apos;s doctor .
clinical trials were most frequent during a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and fruit @-@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience report .
similar results in the group with the highest dosage showed themselves of adverse events such as in the other dos@@ ages ; there were no dose @-@ effectiveness .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , given an intraven@@ ous day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason &apos;s intraven@@ ous day .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 667 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyc@@ lo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , given to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with heavily em@@ aci@@ tive chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the action of the vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administered in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption According to intraven@@ ous gift following an initial decrease in the plasma centr@@ ist , a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average termin@@ ations of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma cent@@ er@@ line ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally consistent in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after an intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg , each second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ zin@@ om@@ pati@@ os between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ ent@@ ric ( ± SD ) in 42 ± 34 % .
a total exposure of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached a total ratio of 0.@@ 75 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , however , the C@@ max was higher after the inclusion of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys , and roughly 50 % are transformed into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies of Met@@ abol@@ ism , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in metabol@@ ism .
elim@@ ination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reported about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changeable active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ usin@@ tion at the time the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in fact , in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ umen and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies were observed only after ex@@ positions that are regarded as sufficient concerning the maximum human exposure , which suggests a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies show evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion @-@ channels , which can extend at the vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was given in approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a higher frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ op@@ last@@ y ( thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary g@@ land ) and skin tum@@ ors at rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the very high doses and da Alo@@ xi used for a unique application , the relev@@ ance of this results will be evaluated as for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise issued by the approval of hepatitis C medicines provided by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should res@@ emble a biological drug named ro@@ cking @-@ A with the same phar@@ yn@@ ical component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference practition@@ er . &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ curing ) hepatitis C ( a virus infection caused by virus infection .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue has damage caused , furthermore , the values of the liver @-@ enc@@ ils Al@@ an@@ om@@ amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood @-@ standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene was applied ( DNA ) that stimulates the formation of the active ingredient .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon expressed data prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active ingredient , composition , and purity of pharmaceuticals , mode of operation , safety , and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
the study of hepatitis C patients with the efficacy of the reference arz@@ rate was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of treatment ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .

in addition , concerns were largely expressed , that the data for the stability of the active ingredient is not sufficient .
the number of patients with Hepatitis C , which was applied to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ w @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was again applied to more patients than with the reference physician ; Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that the test was used to investigate the question , to what extent the drug is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( kn@@ iss@@ - or car@@ w@@ ounds ) , amor@@ tisation and par@@ aly@@ zed w@@ ounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections that were det@@ ectable or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go could not work against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients with the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should investigate the patient again and investigate alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Rib@@ os@@ omen ( the parts of bacterial cells , in which proteins are produced ) and inhib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main indic@@ ative of effectiveness was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was revers@@ ed after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients under@@ taking the treatment to placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ w@@ ounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin tw@@ ins , about 90 % of the patients were treated for the treatment .
in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ bey ( eit@@ ed hol@@ low ca@@ vi@@ ties in body tissues ) , or of infections that were det@@ ectable or presum@@ ably by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a matur@@ ation at the place of the order .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , depreciation or par@@ aly@@ ed w@@ ounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients in which there are no improvements in two to three days , should be considered once again and an alternative therapy is considered to be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of Sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the ano@@ inting carefully and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be applied to the treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials with secondary severe w@@ ounds was the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place will occur .
the impact of con@@ current application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low surface centr@@ alized , which were achieved with the cutting of top@@ ical skin or infected w@@ ounds , a clin@@ ically important inhib@@ ition is not expected in vivo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the medium Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after the top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on the dic@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure of patients with regard to top@@ ical use in patients , dos@@ ages are not required for patients when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction of re@@ productive tox@@ icity after the birth and are in@@ adequate in respect to the birth and the federal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic antibio@@ tic antibio@@ tic .

in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most frequently reported side effects of the administration , which was about 1 % of patients .
active Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhib@@ ition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction with a specific binding point of the 50s sub@@ unit of bacterial Rib@@ os@@ oms , which differs from the binding of other ri@@ j@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the bonds of ri@@ j@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ j@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ dings and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ er center .
by binding on this binding place , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhib@@ its pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , partly P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s @-@ bos@@ ses sub@@ units .
due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin application should appear in at least some infections that should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tr@@ unks with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ cid@@ entally ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was raised 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on int@@ act on int@@ act and un@@ cover skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days of the top@@ ical treatment of sec@@ ular traum@@ atic wound , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed in 3 or 4 in adult patients each before medi@@ ation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording on humans according to the top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhib@@ ition .

Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases , which concern the liver ) for children between the ages of one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vaccination program , whereby a protection against hepatitis B is only reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is only used when immun@@ ization is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the vacc@@ ines existing from two doses can be led to an end .
if a collecting dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or a different hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by bringing it to the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) , &quot; as opposed to sick@@ ness .
after a child received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; strange &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and which has been approved since 1997 of Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vaccination program .
because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indic@@ ative for the efficacy was the proportion of ger@@ min@@ ced children who had developed a protective antibody concentration after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix introduced a month after the last injection to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % .
the additional study showed that the degree of ambi@@ ance was similar to a six - and at a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( ob@@ serves more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ aches , appeti@@ te , pain on injection , red@@ ness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) and maturity .
Ambi@@ rix may not react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibio@@ tic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals . a approval for the placing of ambi@@ rix in total
the standardization plan for the Grun@@ dim@@ mun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose .
if a flange is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combined with a combination @-@ sim@@ ulating agent .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B @-@ virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody responses were observed in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not completely secured that immun@@ compet@@ encies can be addressed as protection against hepatitis A@@ - vaccination as protection , as they may also be protected against immun@@ ological memory by an immun@@ ological memory .
3 As for all inj@@ ections according to the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , the corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization of hepatitis B is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ HAV@@ ING and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies , so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccination can be required .
since intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimum imp@@ lications , these inj@@ ectors should be avoided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected by sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular gift to ble@@ eding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ an , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influenza vaccine , was the immune response to all Anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defect must be assumed that no adequate immune response should be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ernal , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache , and fever compar@@ ably comparable to the previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ vative @-@ containing vacc@@ ines .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines ambi@@ rix were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 and up to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination simulator .
the only exceptions included the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ernity on a calculation basis per vaccination program ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects following the gift of a dose of 3 doses combined sim@@ ulations .
following the complete vaccination course , 6@@ 6.4 % of the test persons reported that Ambi@@ rix had been given greater pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % with the test subjects , which have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combined sim@@ ulations .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable high ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ ines working at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects , the ambi@@ rix received , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % with the subjects that received the 3 @-@ dose combinations ) .
the pre@@ valence of pre@@ defined pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to the combination of combined sim@@ ulations with the 3 @-@ dose vaccination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was similar to that , with the 3 @-@ dose combination @-@ sim@@ ulated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , at the 6- to 11 , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not reported per promot@@ er .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines involving over serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine schem@@ as with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine schem@@ as with a combination @-@ sim@@ ulated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B - surface an@@ tigen reported , was not different .
in clinical studies that were carried out at vacc@@ ines at age of 1 and including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 , administered a month ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 , the dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study that was conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans ambi@@ rix and 147 were treated with three doses .
for the 289 people , whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was the serum rates ( SP in table below ) against Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ tin @-@ material significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ otherapy involving a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds were achieved after the termination of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose @-@ vaccination schema with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose @-@ vaccination with a combination @-@ sim@@ ulated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
in people who were at the time of the Grun@@ dim@@ mun@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens , consisting of 360 ELISA @-@ units inform@@ al in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine is comparable to the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccination .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through vir@@ us@@ hal@@ y food and drinks , but can also be transferred by other ways like swimming in water contaminated by wast@@ e@@ water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , an in@@ dul@@ gen@@ ces face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect against infection with hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are using / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines ambi@@ rix are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or sick ) , a vaccination may not prevent a vaccination .
a protection against other infections that are damage caused by liver or symptoms that are similar to hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If you have already an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any element of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibio@@ tic ) .
an allergic reaction can occur through it@@ ching skin supplements , breath or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • If you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . if you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and usually the administration of the second vaccine dose ) .
for a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccine , the physician will help you / your child from a vaccination with ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will suggest you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine , with an reduced content of effective components per vaccination dose ( 360 ELISA @-@ B @-@ virus and 10 micro @-@ gram of a combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine will usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before termination of the vaccination series .
sometimes ambi@@ tion is suffering from persons who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened by a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child will under@@ go a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis / under@@ wear .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is .
21 Speak to your doctor if you have taken another medicine / enter your child ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given , or this is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case , the immune response in the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible in different li@@ mb@@ s .
if ambi@@ tion is administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is probably that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
normally ambi@@ tion is not administered or breast@@ feeding women , except it is urg@@ ently necessary that they vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about particular mis@@ cellaneous components from Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibio@@ tic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since the approval of the first approval for placing the market , CH@@ MP has proven that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , Ambi@@ rix is only limited to one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ ective disorder or with hyper@@ text concentrations ( cer@@ eb@@ ral injury due to high ammonia concentrations ) .
Am@@ mon@@ o@@ qu@@ or is divided into several single doses at meals - bl@@ ended under the food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nose probe ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
there was no @-@ comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ ogram could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a pseud@@ o @-@ medicine , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ium can also lead to appeti@@ te loss , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , pain re@@ tention , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , de@@ fl@@ ection , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , r@@ ash , nau@@ sea , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ um effectively avo@@ ids patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle to high levels of ammon@@ ium .
Am@@ mon@@ oli@@ an was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine templates .
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manipul@@ ated form ( in@@ complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which is manifested according to the first life of life ) , there is an indicator for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese represents a hyper@@ glyc@@ em@@ ulation of bovine spongiform encephalopath@@ y .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low , pills to swal@@ low or for patients with lo@@ ckers , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ules .
the daily dose is individually prescribed for protein toler@@ ance and for growth and development necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences the ordinary daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ manifest deficiency of Car@@ b@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny , or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny b@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine deficiency deficiency need ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills may not be administered with can@@ y@@ ons , since a risk for the emer@@ gence of Ö@@ e@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a exists when the tablets are not able to arrive at the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used to treat patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or he@@ avier cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with sodium re@@ tention and o@@ dem@@ entia use only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and de@@ position of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS throughout pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
it could not be detected if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate is eliminated in human breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of those un@@ wanted events were assumed that they were not related to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ k@@ tic patient who developed a metab@@ olic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ose , severe mort@@ g@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a short dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) was a case of an over@@ dose rate with a accid@@ ental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms occur with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate , which showed a dos@@ si@@ lim@@ iting neur@@ otox@@ icity with an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate is a metab@@ oli@@ ically active combination that con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is di@@ vor@@ ced via the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea . ( both cou@@ plings contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore particularly suited as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ dible nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed to produce sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance to improve the diagnosis , and treatment immediately , to improve survival chances and clinical result .
the prog@@ nosis of the early @-@ resistant form of the disease with initial symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ist , and the disease resulted in treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free anal@@ ogues for the first year of life .
by ha@@ emat@@ aly@@ sis , explo@@ iting alternative ways of nitrogen separation ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate ) , protein reduced K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase survival in post @-@ party ( however within the first month of life ) .
in patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients , patients came with many intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ os form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ illo b@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its already are hardly reversible , and in some cases , a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle , of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis for individuals as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous treatment of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ us .
after an or@@ ic single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form were detected 15 minutes after taking the plasma tor@@ rent of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cyc@@ lical disorders or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day , up to 20 g / day ) , there was no phen@@ yl@@ ate acet@@ ate in plasma in the next morning .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , who were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day ) treated in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ at@@ concentrations were treated five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is di@@ vor@@ ced within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken by oral ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets or patients with can@@ y@@ ons ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ en.@@ Alpha or a nose probe .
according to previous clinical experiences the ordinary daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine , and serum proteins should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ manifest deficiency of Car@@ b@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny , or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny b@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ ed were subjected to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ us ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , there came to les@@ ions in the Pyram@@ ids of brain cells .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ k@@ tic patient who developed a metab@@ olic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ose , severe mort@@ g@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea . ( both cou@@ plings contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore particularly suited as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ dible
on the basis of investigations about the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted , that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases , a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an or@@ ic single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ules were determined 15 minutes after intake of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of durability , the patient can retain the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
with this procedure , the small measuring spoon is 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the great measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must obtain the medicine for a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , allowing them to accum@@ ulate nitrogen proteins after consumption of proteins in the body .
when laboratory tests performed , you need to tell the doctor if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
while still , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the drug may survive in breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases also confusion , head@@ ache , taste problems , distur@@ ban@@ ces , distur@@ ban@@ ces , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you identify one of these symptoms , you immediately rely on your doctor or with the emer@@ gence of your hospital in accordance with the introduction of an appropriate treatment .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in breast @-@ cor@@ b ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) , without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ ial measurement value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ograph or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who will under@@ go one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this may help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack for maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at sole administration or in connection with a glyc@@ op@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ an@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and GP@@ I .
during the PCI , patients often have a stable ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and they received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go a PCI , angi@@ ox was equally effective like Hep@@ arin , with the exception of severe ble@@ eding , where it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied in patients , possibly excessive sensitive ( allerg@@ y ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
Moreover , it cannot be applied in patients who had a ble@@ eding , as well as people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is an appropriate replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd with approval for the placing of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting color ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) , with emergency response or early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient was performed in another one PCI Express , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the existing PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed again for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a weight of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h minimum for the duration of the surgery .
safety and effectiveness of a complete Bol@@ us gift from angi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out .
to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed and the bolt dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT indicates more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which can be subjected to PCI Express ( either with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is given and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is once again .
in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney compensation , which included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which included the ACT value for 5 minutes after the gift of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 patients with severe kidney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ogen@@ es can be derived for 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous Hep@@ arin or 8 hours following the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of ra@@ inf@@ ant Hep@@ arin .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or an other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • Active hem@@ or@@ rh@@ es@@ ystems and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly hyper@@ ton@@ al disorders . • severe un@@ controll@@ able hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ thel@@ e@@ tis . • severe kidney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti @-@ an@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI patients occur under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding to arter@@ ial point points , in patients who inter@@ act with per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment principle , ble@@ eding everywhere .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standard debt ratio ) should be drawn to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in will be achieved prior to treatment .
starting from knowledge about the action mechanism of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ers ) , these substances can increase blood haz@@ ard .
during the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ der@@ ers or anti @-@ anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ep@@ och@@ ar parameters are regularly monitored in each case .
the experimental studies have an impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with Hep@@ arin resulted in adverse events over 65 years more often to un@@ wanted incid@@ ents than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ edings were tested according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i &apos;s standards for severe ble@@ eding as defined in Table 2 .
both mild and heavy ble@@ eding started significantly less than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhib@@ itor ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy blood pressure has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular ble@@ eding , hem@@ at@@ lo@@ bin@@ s of ≥ 4 g / dl without obvious blood pressure , reducing hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood pressure , reverse operation due to blood pressure , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .

the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical study involving Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in 6000 patients who under@@ go one PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with Hep@@ arin resulted in adverse events over 65 years more often to un@@ wanted incid@@ ents than in male or younger patients .
both mild and heavy hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages occurred significantly less frequently than in the reference group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported by extensive application in practice and are summarized in Table 6 according to system classes .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in can be canc@@ eled immediately and the patient is eng@@ aging with regard to signs of a ble@@ eding .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm inj@@ ected with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not work with sufficient ins@@ ulin control ( sugar ) in the blood , or the ins@@ ulin is not effective in the blood .
ins@@ ulin is@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it has qu@@ icker and shorter operation time has a short @-@ effective human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body can no ins@@ ulin produce , in two studies with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , the body ins@@ ulin was not effective in type 2 diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indic@@ ative for the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin @-@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients , possibly excessive sensitive ( allerg@@ y ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can inter@@ act on blood glu@@ es .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH an approval for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra into the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is referred to as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the pancre@@ as , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the field of abdominal bags .
due to the reduced Glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced ins@@ ulin resistance , the ins@@ ulin needs of patients with a restriction of the liver function can be lowered .
every change of active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ om@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ age etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can move a change in the ins@@ ulin requirement .
3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ per ; these states are potentially threat@@ ening .
conversion of a patient on another ins@@ ulin type or an ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be made under str@@ ingent medical supervision and may make a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the action profile of the ins@@ ulin @-@ system and can therefore change to change the treatment scheme .
enh@@ ancing the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the inclin@@ ation to h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ sis enzymes , fib@@ ro@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhib@@ itors , pent@@ ox@@ i@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl , po@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effects of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics such as bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ern , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin , the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ al counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ers be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not well @-@ known whether ins@@ ulin occurs in human breast milk , but generally occurs ins@@ ulin , neither in breast milk , it is res@@ or@@ ated according to oral application .

severe h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ sis bodies with imp@@ ess@@ ness can be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ c@@ ular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is prescribed by an intraven@@ ous person , or by an intraven@@ ous gift of glucose through a doctor .
following a glucose sy@@ ringe , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ ine matter for severe h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels through stim@@ ulating peripheral glucose ( especially through sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as through the inhib@@ ition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous G@@ oli@@ be of ins@@ ulin resistance can be qu@@ icker than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ eric , T@@ US showed ins@@ ulin @-@ effective effect of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg a proportional increase of glu@@ ed effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the effective effect , exactly like human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double so fast active effect as normal human ins@@ ulin and generates the complete glu@@ ing effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data , it was obvious that during an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ al glyc@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
Is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was ge@@ aring in 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was given as with human normal @-@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in takes 15 minutes after the start of meal , a comparable glyc@@ em@@ ic control will be given as in human normal @-@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves before meal ( see figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin resistance in a gift of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the start of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal levels ( figure 1A ) , which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
