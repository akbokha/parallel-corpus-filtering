<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Financial Statements Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies to obtain recommendations on the application of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or their treatment, please also read the package dosage (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as a injector solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. effective thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things, which are not present), misstrust and reminders; • Bipolar-I-disorders, a psychic illness, in which patients with manic episodes (periods of abnormal uterus) alternate with periods normal.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for treatment in moderate to serious manisodes and prevention of manic episodes in patients who have been addressed to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for quick control of increased uncertainty or behavioral disorders if the oral medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used for inserting or processed cheese tablets in patients with the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines, the same as Abilify should be removed, the dose of Abilify should be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to one another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in a lower size as the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine to play a role, Aripiprazole also helps to normalize the brain activity, thereby reducing the brain activity, making psychotic or manic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, preventing the symptoms and was investigated in three studies up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution has been compared to two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased uncertainty, compared with a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was deployed to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in a different study conducted the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which had been stabilising on 160 patients in which the manian symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered from Lorazepam (another antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the alteration of the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the company also led studies to investigate, such as the body the melting of tablets and the solution to unabsorbing (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, significantly stronger reduction in symptoms and patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the application of bipolar disorder, Abilify has reduced Abilify in four of five short-term studies and more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented even up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the re-appearance of Manic Episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses are also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased uncertainty and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), vomile (nausea), vompation (nausea), vompation (elevated aliva), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (elevated aliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and severe serious episodes at bipolar-I-disorder and in the prevention of a new one episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the Committee resulted in the result that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable for the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an approval for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate-heavy episodes of bipolar-I- disorder and for prevention of a new one episode in patients who had mostly manian episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justifies this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">When the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the arithpiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing of antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of the epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder showed no increased suicidal risk with Aripiprazole in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used to treat patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, cardiac insufficiency), cerebrovascular disorders, conditions that are used for hypotonia (dehydration, treatment with blood pressure inhibitor) or hypertension (including akzelewed and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials which one year or less continued, there were occasional reports about treatment with Aripiprazole-responsive Dyskinesis.</seg>
<seg id="39">When patients treated with ABILIFY to occur signs and symptoms of a late dynesis, should be drawn into considerations, reduce the dose or decrease the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient was developed and symptoms that point to a mns, or unclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Hence, Aripiprazole should be in connection with crabs in the anamnese or with residues that are associated with crabs in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, an increased death risk compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was however in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the promise for unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazitin or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic activity, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related wanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic activity patients treated with direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is observed as a supplementary effect, respiration and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole to the central nervous system, be careful if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centralized pharmaceutical products (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist is Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not relevant as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with a healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism can be combined common use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma centering of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 Extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY into consideration, the potential benefit should predominate potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as Itraconazole and HIV proteasants, should have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After applying the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors the dosage of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose height prior to beginning of supporting therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escuopem or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered together with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methodology), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Warfarol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be said to notify your doctor, when pregnant or pregnant women, during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data for security in human beings, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, like other antipsychotics, patients should be warned, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to use, until they are safe, Aripiprazole has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical-relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the above mentioned side effects is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyskinesis, compared with patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was in patients under Aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Bipolar Episodes at bipolar-I-disorders - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% was observed in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was in patients under Aripiprazole and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term acceptance period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo was treated.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routine sector, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic treated patients were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neurosurgery syndrome, late-cerebrovascular events, and increased mortality rate in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or unintentional overdosages were observed in adult patients with estimated doses ranging from up to 1260 mg and without a cause.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the efficacy of a hematalysis in the treatment of a overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is inlikely that hemoralysis has resulted in treating a overdose of benefits because Aripiprazole has a high plasma bond.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole at schizophrenia and bipolar-I-disorder occurs on the combination of a participantagonist effect on dopamine d2- and serotonin 5HT1s receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine d2- and D3-receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a fresh affinity to Dopamine D4-, for the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenees and to the histamine-H1receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">In gift of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily, the Positons-Emission-Tomography showed a dosed dependent of binding 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor lignment, at Nucleus caudatus and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks), Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant greater improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a week 52 the proportion of response to the study was observed in week 52 of response to the study mediation included in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery-Assign- Depressionrates scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, NSC piprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of decline, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational twin-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks, 314 patients included in the primary study destination 'weight gain' (N = 18 or 13% of the outpatient patients) in significantly less patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with more flexible dose over 3 weeks with patient or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo over placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patient or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two Placeboar- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazole showed a positive effect compared to placebo for a combination of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also proved a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of Manie based on such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 6 weeks with patient or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, the supporting therapy with Aripiprazole showed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms in comparison to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks, Aripiprazole showed up against placebo during a stabilizing phase before placebo for prevention of a bipolar backdrop, mainly for prevention of a relapse.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes responsible for the elongation and hydroxyzure of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkymann is catalysed by CYP3A4 catalyst.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination-life time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole via CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, including a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation for pharmacokinetics had no reference to clinically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the influence of smoking based on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic qualities of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to isolate slaughter to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, mycotoxicity and the refractory potential, the preclinical data set no special hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only during doses or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects includes a dossier-dependent adniotic membrane (AUC) of 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3-10 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a Cholelithiasis was established as a result of the extermination of sulphate conjugates to hydroxyprazole in the Galle of monkeys to a repeatable oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human race at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, hydropiprazole were not found at least 6% of the concentrations, which were determined in the study above 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">During rabbits, these effects were observed according to doses of 3- and 11x of the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose, observed.</seg>

<seg id="300">Ruhelodeficiency 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity can be calculated based on a similar case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no colloquial connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-rotubine ingredient, which promotes the formation of the microtubules from Tubular indimers and stabilizes the microtubules with inhibiting of their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of normal dynamic reorganization of microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interest-phase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys plasma cells in endothelial components in the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of Albumin has been promoting the transport of Paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this enhanced transentheliale transport through the gp-60-album counter is conveyed and due to the albuminous protein acidic protein acidic rich in cysteine) a Paclitaxel accumulation in the tumour occurs.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-restriction studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>

<seg id="317">10 After an intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel plasma toration took effect on multi-phase cells.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has an extensive external distribution and / or turnout connection of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic qualities of Paclitaxel were compared with intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-Gift higher (43%) than after a solvent-containing Paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating, Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized with two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic mammakarcinoma, mean value for cumulative loss of less than 1% of the specified total dose with less than 1% of metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="360">In case of patients with normal blood levels, it could occur in connection with a blood transfusion complications, if the procedure is not possible, in case of which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with seamed must be led under the supervision of a doctor, the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, which is displayed for the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who want to leave blood circulation, Abseamed is injected into a vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be done by the patient or its responsible person, if they have received an appropriate manual.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy, the hemoglobins should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be controlled prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency should be administered during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who received chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anemia could be caused by an Erythropoietine deficiency, or that the body is not sufficiently responding to body's own Erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells, thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell that was associated with a gene (DNA) that it is capable of producing epetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to an injection in a vene in the framework of a main study of 479 patients who suffered anemia caused by kidney problems, compared to reference professional.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks before Eprex / Erypo, before they were treated either to Abseamed or still Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicative of the efficacy was the change of hemoglobind values between the beginning of the study and the reference period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">Moreover, the company also laid down the results of a study in which the effects performed by the skin-coated Abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo, with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study, patients suffering from kidney problems caused haemoglobin values of patients who were treated at intervals, in the same measurements, as in those patients who continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common adverse effect of Abseamed is a rise of blood pressure, occasionally about symptoms of cephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, ruined migrant headache and perplexity.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed cannot be applied in patients, possibly excessive sensitive (allergy) against epoxy or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed than injections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems, because further studies are required to ensure that this is not allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Abseamed has provided evidence of evidence according to the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficiency profile like Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, presented Abseamed will provide information for medical specialists in all Member States information, including information about the safety of medicines.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anesome symptoms and follicaries may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease-load; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical diagnosis and disease resistance is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobins by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) should be avoided over a period of four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients can occasionally be observed with an individual hemoglobind values, or under the hemoglobin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobinder should be tried by a corresponding dose management, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / l (7.5 mmol / l) can be reached.</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobinder exceeds more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or when the permanent hemoglobinder is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoch-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epigtin alfa canceled at the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anemia and anesome symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epigtin alfa canceled at the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anesymph symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemoglobins, at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reproduction number has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be retained per week or 450 I.U. / kg each week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobinder rose &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reproduction number &lt; 0,62 mmol / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 m / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of hemoglobinder equals ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the reproduction number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, should be retained a dose of 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobinder has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or refractory cyte at &lt; 0,62 mmol / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoch-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with light anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precatial deposit of ≥ 4 blood conserved is required to receive intervals of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to the operative intervention.</seg>

<seg id="420">For tumor patients under chemotherapy, for the assessment of therapy-efficiency of epetin alfa, a 2-3 weeks delaying between epetin-alfa-gift and the erythropoetin should be considered (patients who may be transconsolidated).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose should be minimized to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical treatment-related anemia - dose adjustment between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application recombinable Erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction under participation of the respective patients who should also consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for an extensive orthopedic encroachment, the cause of the anemia was examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of the epoch-alfa surgery.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who received a major orthopedic procedure should receive appropriate thromboseprophylaxis, because they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular disorders, especially in an initial cardiovascular disease.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Financial Statements Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies to obtain recommendations on the application of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="750">Activation is applied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It may not be used in patients (in particular overweight patients). • It can be used together with another diabetesmedicine (dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients) can be applied using metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose cannot be satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a Sulfonyl hard foam or insulin, the previous dose of Sulfonyl harnant or insulin can be maintained, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphide-resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better tolerated and the blood sugar level falls to better adjust type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acetate in tripletherapy were examined; patients received a combination of metformin with a Sulfonyl hard filler, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glykosylized hemoglobin, HbA1c), which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of HbA1c-value, which allows blood glucose in use of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Triplea study, the effect of the additional administration of acetine and a sulfonyl harnmaterial showed in a decrease of HbA1c levels by 0.94% while the additional gift of placebo caused by a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of acetate and insulin at 289 patients were examined, the patients receiving the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took placebo in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects in connection with Actos were visual disturbances, infections of upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used either in patients who may react sensitive (allergy) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic ketoazia (high level mirror - acidble levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin patients in cases where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for placing accounts within the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also displayed for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient and inappropriate in which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age are not available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), doctor should start treatment with lowest available dose and increase the dose in stages.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or eye-dees, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and furnaces, if Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular study involving Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of congestive heart failure occurred, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard) or with other signs of liver disease must not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient was developed which point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, tornness, fatigue, appetite, and / or dark Harn, are the liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be continued, should be guided by the clinical assessment of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone has been demonstrated a dossidependent weight gain, which can stir in fat deposits and connected in some cases with a liquid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a haemic dilution, the therapy with Pioglitazone has a minimal reduction in the central hemoglobins (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 3-4%) and with a lesser extent even in patients under sulphide resin and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity, patients receiving Pioglitazon as oral or triple-combination therapy with a Sulfonyl harnent or as two-way combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dossier related pypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the introduction of the introduction of thiazolidindices, including Pioglitazon, including Pioglitazon, about a occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema, with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there are a direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edemons, however, doctors should be aware of visual acuity, if patients suffering from disturbances of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological clarification should be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of notifying adverse events concerning fractured, controlled, double-blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fraction incidence amounted to 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medullation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigating cardiovascular events, represented fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medullation.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or resetting the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the examination of interactions were shown that Pioglitazone had no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical-dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptiva, Cyclosporin, Calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA reducer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC from Pioglitazone for 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (an cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a decrease of AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulin emia and increased insulin resistance in pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>

<seg id="791">They lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refraction of the lens as they can also be observed in other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone about three times the upper limit of the standardization area, however, often referred to as in placebo, but more rarely than in comparative cases under metformin or sulphide-resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with previously advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of a serious heart failure in Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than under placebo, if Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely about hernia-sufficiency has been reported under Pioglitazon, but more frequently when Pioglitazon has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summarizing analysis of notifying adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with previously treated medico-treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of running ProActive study, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">For taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, after 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have a activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-γ) proliferation, which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the Glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose analysis in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving Pioglitazon versus Glicladic than monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time up to leave the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment of therapy, blood glucose monitoring could be maintained (as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazone for 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were discontinued with insulin delivery due to insulin delivery, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone reduced the mean HbA1c - a value of 0.45%, compared with the patients who continued only insulin; a reduction in the insulin dose treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotient compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small age on 18 weeks in type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, placebo was significantly reduced in comparison to placebo a reduction of CO2-glycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as a slightly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced in comparison to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid, the total plastificate glycoeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, a statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel was detected in comparison to placebo during metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglycerides, but also improved triglycerides level, which provides both a effect on triglyceride-Absorption than also on hepatic Triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease were randomised in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazone is rapidly resorated, whereby the peak concentrations of Pioglitazone can be reached in the plasma in a period of 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about the three times of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical-dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or lowers the plasma torrent of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">Following the application of radioactive Pioglitazon in humans the marker was mainly found in the drums (55%) and to a lesser extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The medium plasma-elimination half life of unchangeable Pioglitazone is about 5-6 hours, while the entire active metabolites is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma torrent of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in healthy volunteers with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects, but resemble the oral Clearance of the mother's Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, after repeated plasma volume with hemoratory, anemia, and reversible heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to breast cancer, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased independencies of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of family-specific polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidindices led to an increased frequency of colontumres.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigating cardiovascular events, represented fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medullation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years, the effects of combination therapy of metformin were studied with Pioglitazone or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotient compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial triglyceride mirror, which gives both a effect on the TryGlyzerid-Absorption than also on hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacking in terms of their primary endpoint, which resulted in a combination of the overall mortality, non-lethal Coronarisation syndrome, leg amputation and reascularisation of the leg arteries, laying down results close that with the intake of Pioglitazon are not related to cardiovascularization.</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, results of a clinical study was presented to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, whereby the application of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicative of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplantation was discharged by one year (by example, how often a renewed organ transplantation or a resumption of the dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more clinical studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplantation and analyzed, such as Advagraf is absorbed by the body as Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1407">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against tacrolimus, macroid antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or one of other components, Advagraf must not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and doctors must be careful if others (in particular some vegetable) medicines can be taken simultaneously with Advagraf, as the Advagraf dose or the dose of the same medication may be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosressive therapy and treatment of transplantation patients, should be prescribed or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to transplanting operations or to an increased incidence of side effects, including lower or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dose; Modification of formulation or regime should only be done under the close control of an experienced medicine (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In succession of changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosages must be carried out to ensure that systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of deprivation and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf the tacrolimus dam should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 the systemic exposure was measured as valley mirror, with both wording both in kidney and superior patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate imtransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As Tacrolimus is a substance with low-Clearance, can last several days, until the Steady State is achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application to suppression of transplanting must be maintained; consequently, the immune suppression must not be specified; therefore, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of transplanting phases The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Additional dosages may be required later, since the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplanting phases The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage: changeover from Prograf to Advagraf must be applied for a daily intake of prograf capsules twice daily intake of prograf capsules, so this changeover in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a changeover from other immune suppressants to Advagraf once a day, treatment with each treatment recommended in kidney and liver transplantation recommended for the prophylaxis of transplanting.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant For adult patients who are converted to Advagraf, an oral initiation dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receivers Obthough there are no clinical experience with Advratf at lung, pankreas- and darkentransplant patients in an oral initiation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplant in an oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosages in special patient groups with reduced liver function for maintaining blood levels in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function is no influence on pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of tacrolimus, however, a careful surveillance of the kidney function (including a regular determination of serum levels of serum and monitoring of the urinary tract) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf At the changeover from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is caution (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the valley mirror in full blood, the dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of shock-shock and tolerability in individual case of full-bloody tacrolimus dam-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common checks of the Tacrolimus dam during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during the maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talking mirror from Tacrolimus should also be checked after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosisadjustment, changes of immune suppression therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change tacrolimus full blood concentrations (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the steady state.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley mirror has not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley mirror of Tacrolimus usually lie in the first time after liver transplantation usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and with gracized patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and cardiology, blood concentrations were generally used in the range from 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This caused serious adverse events, including transplanting repulsions or other side effects, which may occur in a row of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dose; Modification of formulation or regime should only be done under the engulatory control of experienced medicine (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplanting repulent, which proved to be exhausting against other immunosressiva, do not exist any clinical data for retarded formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In favour of the prophylaxis of transplanting during an adult cardiac graft, no clinical data for retarded formulation are not yet present.</seg>
<seg id="1443">For possible interaction, which can lead to a reduction of tactile mirror in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, is the pill of herbal supplements (hypericum perforatum), or other plant remedy during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of tactile concentrations in the blood, as the tacrolimus blood levels can be subjected to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf, aqueous humor or Septumhypertrophy was observed in rare cases, which may therefore occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, a treatment with corticoeroid, hypertension, kidney function, infections, liquid uploading and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like with other immunossuppressants, the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to proper clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protective factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">When patients showing tacrolimus symptoms, symptoms of porres such as headache, changed consciousness levels, convulsions and vision disturbances should demonstrate a radiological examination (e.g., for example).</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf hard capsules, retardiert, lactose contain special attention in patients with the rare hereditary gactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-gactose-paint absorption special caution.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medicinal products that are known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of Tacrolimus and therefore reduce blood levels of tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to change tacrolimus- blood levels when changing the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations accordingly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction of antifungus like ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Itraconazole, and Voriconazole, and with the Macromedia antibiotic Erythromycin and HIV-proteasants (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the elevated oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, due to the inhibiting of gastrointestinal contamination, resulted.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute deduction reactions, can increase or lower concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4, affecting metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus minimise the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus, the hormonal exposure may be particularly careful with decisions on receptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus potentially reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenazon and extend their half-time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of investigations on transplantation patients provide no note that under Tacrolimus an increased risk for unwanted events in regard to the course and result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malicious Neoplasma including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in combination with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins can be accepted that Tacrolimus is not dialysing.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism of action and pharmacological effects on molecular level can be conveyed the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to cytosolish protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in cell-cellars.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a shortage of factor VIII, congenital blood circulation).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of application are given after advate for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood clots such as bleeding in joints, muscles, or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but based on a method that is called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that was associated with a gene (DNA) that it is capable of promoting the human body factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union, including Recombinate, similar, but it contains different proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe until moderate hemophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six years, was examined the application of pharmaceuticals for prevention of bleeding as well as surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the effectiveness of Advantages was given in 86% of 510 new blood sepisodes with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies towards factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances may not be applied in patients, possibly excessive sensitive (allergy) against the human being factor VIII, Mausoleum or hamsterprotein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG approval for placing the marketing of Advances throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitutes may differ according to the severity of factor VIII deficiency, after the place and the degree of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following haemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity should not drop under the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>

<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, it is stimulated to control the dose and frequency of injections an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma tiles.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different semitones.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. by factor VIII a kg body weight within a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>

<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective, so other therapeutic measures must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The allocation is to be determined after filling the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors have always been quantified against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII and IgG immunglobulins that quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk, inhibitors to develop, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk occurs within the first 20 expositions on the largest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the use of available data, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit risk provisions as a positive result, but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which required a filing of PSURS every 6 months, the authorisation holder is to apply for another extension for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited registered the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) officially announced that the company takes on approval for the market entry of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, the breast, brain, bones, or turnaround (tissues, the other structures in the body combines, surrounds and support).</seg>
<seg id="1642">In this way, it is a type of virus that has been genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus," "" "that has changed no copies of themselves, and therefore no infections may trigger human beings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumours and to form the cancer cells, to form normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein that is formed from non-defective in the human body of existing p53 gene, usually carries the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni cancer, the p53-gene is defective, the p53-protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company recorded data from a study of a study involving the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the realm of undermining, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP the responses of the company had examined the questions, still some questions were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the documents submitted, CHMP provides a list of questions that sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP's view, the injection of Advance in Li-Fraumeni tumours are advantageous for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee had further concerns relating to the processing of drug in the body, the way of administration and drug safety.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advance can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment, nor for people who come in in-form contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company was aware that CHMP did not know whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered effect" means that the tablets are thus assembled, that one of the effective components is immediately released, and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergy rhinitis (hay fever, caused by a allergy to pollen caused inflammation of the nostrils) in patients with nose-loop swelling (violoped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12 years, the recommended dose of aeropaze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose-mucous nose (violopted nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of medicines can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measurements were the change of the severity of the Heuvenshrome symptoms that were reported in patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and valuate the symptoms in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all the hypocrumenshrome symptoms, besides the constipation of the nose reported patients that aeropaze accounted for 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in patients receiving Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucous membrane, the patients showed an alleviation of symptoms by 37.4% compared with 26.7% in patients who revenues desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observing at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients), nitrous oxide, dizzinxie (appetite inaction), constipation, headache, tiredness, fatigue, Insomnia (insomnia), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze must be non-sensitive (allergy) against desloratadin, pseudo-ephedrin or one of the other components, against adrenders active ingredients or Loratadin (another medicine for allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze must not be applied in patients with hypertension (hypertension), cardiac or vessel disease including hypertension (hypertension), cardiac disease (overfunction of thyroid), or already a haemorrhagic stroke (overfunction of thyroid) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted its SP Europe approval approval for the placing of aeropaze of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, if swallowed up (i.e. without them to break down or cut them).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data to discomfort and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, since long-term application can take the activity of pseudo ephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After drop in swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory because of the treatment with desloratadine can be continued as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because Aerinaze Pseudoephedrin contains, is the medicine also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity combined with other vasoconstrictors such as Bromocripitin, Pergolid, Pergolid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other deonemtiva, phenylephrine, ephedrin, Oxymetazolin, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's disease, and do not submit data to increase related recommendations for dosing.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of aeropaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function and do not submit data to increase related recommendations for dosing.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment at the occurrence of hypertension or tachycardia or aggravings, heart rhythm disturbances, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or gain of headache) must be deposited.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups: • patients with cardiovascular problems • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder, or bronchospasm in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must cover at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as Antihistamine can prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce their dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with Desloratadin, in addition to pathythromycin or ketoconazole, no clinically relevant interactions were observed, however, were observed in the plasma torrent of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychological tests, no significant differences could be detected between the patients treated with Desloratadin and placebo patients, regardless of whether desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme inresponsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin is not identified, so the interactions with other medicines could not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate is an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of application of aeropaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase of abnormalities compared to the prevalence of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals don't always be transferred to humans and should not be used for peoconstrictor properties of pseudo constriedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should however be clarified that it may occur in very rare cases to a drowness, which may result in impairment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnoe, dimined mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular colliquor) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, Tremor, convulsions) with possible letteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, usability and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing sufficiency, heart rhythm disturbances, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vinnitus, ataxy, visual disturbances or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin typical symptoms (oral drying, pupillenstarre and diatation, skin irritation, hyperthermia, gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-8, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 of human mast cells / basophilen as well as the inhibition of the expression of the noblems P-Seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose-study with adults, Desloratadine showed no influence on standard measurement variables including amplification, subjective, or the tasks that are connected with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased frequency of strokes in comparison to placebo was detected at the recommended dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudo ephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1.248 patients aged between the ages of 12 and 78 with seasonal allergy rhinitis, 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonist effectiveness of aeropaze tablets, determined by the total value for the symptom (except nasal grinding swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudo ephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nose-loop swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the framework of a single dose trial for the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze is distillatadin within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze at healthy subjects of 14 days, the flow-balance of disinloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrin was reached in 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dossier study, which was conducted with formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, four subjects of disinteratadin poorly contentious.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component-interact study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudo-ephedrin, after the first gift of pseudo-ephedrin, was the exposure to a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, the toxicity and reproduction of reproduction can be detected with Desloratadin, however, no particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no longer toxicity than their individual components, and observed effects were generally associated with the content of Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductionate studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrin was a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 the regulatory approval system was established and works, before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relieving of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, which can unfold its own substance.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets left symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergy rhinitis (hay fever), like Niesen, running or itching eyes with constiptive eyes in constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was investigated in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials in seasonal allergy and two studies on patients who had also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of squares, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) and after six weeks of treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to realise that the body absorbs the syrup and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">With allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius were given to an average decrease of the symptom score (symptom score) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decline of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtikaria, the acceptance of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of Desloratadin in youth from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergy rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be terminated according to the clinical symptoms and can be resumed once again after the symptoms of disease.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persist allergy rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), patients can be recommended during the cost-effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical trials involving desloratadin tablets, in which Erythromycin or Ketoconazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, Aerius and alcohol was not reinforced with alcohol taking effect of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should not be clarified that it may cause drowness in very rare cases, which may cause impairment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical studies in various indications, including allergy rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urtic, at the recommended dose of 5 mg, 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius were reported when patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently occurring adverse events that were reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue (1.2%), oral dryer (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse reactions were treated at 5.9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadin and 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, up to 45 mg of desloratadine (neunfold clinical dose) were observed, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophilen as well as the inhibition of the expression of the noblems P-Seltin to endothelelialcells.</seg>

<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, Nassecretion and itching of the nose, itching and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified as depending on the duration of symptoms or alternatively in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persist allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Interacting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persist allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown from the totality of Questionnaire at Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively diminished, caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic uraria was also examined for other forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of offices in different forms, and chronic patients can be recruited quite prospective.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine faced a significant factor in all urtikarial diseases, Desloratadin is expected to improve symptoms in other forms of urticaria, in addition to improving the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines, the minority of the patients who didn't react to antihistamines, were excluded from the study.</seg>

<seg id="1756">There are no indications for a clinically important cumulation once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days before.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, not identified for Metabolism of Desloratadin enzyme, however, the interactions with other medicines could not be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier with Desloratadin, in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (greasy, calorie-rich breakfast) can not be found on the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be used independently of meals, for alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and personal allergy rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see Section 4.4) and that no data suggest that treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory diseases or anatomical anomalies, anamnese, physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play an important role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolize Desloratadin restricted and experienced a higher resolution loading (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children from 2 to 11 years of age, respecting - is identical to the children that are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains saccharose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with inherited problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose-absorptionsheming or a Saccharase-Isomaltas- insufficiency of this medicine do not use this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving Aerius tablets, in which Erythromycin or Ketoconazole have been given in addition to (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, for simultaneous use of Aerius tablets and alcohol the most powerful effect of alcohol is not affected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total stiffness of the side effects for children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the Aerius Sirup group like in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urtic, at the recommended dose reported 3% more side effects in patients suffering from Aerius, patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, Nassecretion and itching of the nose, itching and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown from the total questionnaire to life cycle at rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets are effective, caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The proliferation of this restricted metabolitic phenotyps was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than for Caucavities (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who could not swallow capsules, Agenerase can be taken as a solution for insertion, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the security of this combination has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined the antiviral medicine of the patient before, and the likelihood has been assured that the virus is addressing the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amniavir as a solution for insertion is 14% less than capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors like Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which depends strongly from CYP3A4, increased enhancements in plasma tiles at the concurrent administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaspbar increases this HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this drug is not recommended with Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as well as stabilization of the mirror is recommended because the plasma centerations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by amnioons (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Hence, Agenerase must not be applied together with oral embalem Midazolam (see section 4.3) while using Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protochibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma tiles from Midazolam to 3 to 4 foot.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If Methadone is administered along with Amunavir, therefore, patients should therefore be monitored at Opiatental symptom, especially if there is also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to its low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given how the Amitavir- dose is to be administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oric anti-anticulants, together with Agenerase, a reinforced control of INR (International standard of Ratio) is recommended because of a shortcoming or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir to hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore, alternative methods for conception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (such as Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the benefit of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, I84A / L / V, I84A / L / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with Ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological contact (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation sms can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to utilize the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">In combination with prototypical resistance-based analyses, phenotypical interpretations, phenotypical interpretations, phenotypical interpretations, phenotypical data can be used in conjunction with the genotype data for the activity of amobavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasant-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that have diagnostic resistance tests have been developed in clinical-phenotypical cut-offs (partition points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amunavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir, but remains generally accepted.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistant between ammonium and other proteasants for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>

<seg id="2033">Vice-versa, Amopavir retains its activity against some other proteasant-resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to observe the accumulation of a variety of mutations in borders, which may affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The receipt of the efficacy of aslease in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI pretreated adults (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC), with a PI, predominantly with a minimised Ritonavir "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the sub-study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis posed by APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI-Group with regard to the time-adjuvant average (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, in a non-non-law threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The receipt of the efficacy of unboostered Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In studies, Agenerase has been used for insertion and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg each day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily. the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It was given at the same time, the majority of the patients treated with PI was given at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of patients included in the study included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered with PI pre-treated children of the expected benefit of "ungeboostered" Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the mean duration is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax against 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with Amburavir (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amruavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amunavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the Steady state (Cmin, ss) of the food intake remained unaffected, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of the resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg) and a large distribution volume, as well as an uninterrupted penetration of the blood circulation in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in plasma, with the amount of unbound amobavir, which remains the active proportion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unobstructible Amunavir remain constant, fluctuating the percentage of free active ingredient during the metady-concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss by Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drug, CYP3A4 induced or inhibit a substrate of CYP3A4, should be administered with caution if they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg each day, leads to a similar daily amniated exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amopavir is made from the solution 14% less bioavailable as from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is neglected, therefore the effect of a renal function on the elimination of Amfavir and Ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes carry on Amunavir Plasmascot comparable to those who have been attained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Amdravir twice daily without prior administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the carcinogenesis of mice and rats at doses of mice and rats at dosages, the exposure of the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Amitavir, said.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatocellullar adenoma and carcinoma was not yet clarified and the relevance of this observed effects for human beings is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data on people, both clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application, however, little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of this findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and In-vitro-genital tests, the bacterial reverse Mutation Test (Ames-Test), mouse-lymphoma-test, micro-core test of rats and chromosome aberrations were infected by human peripheral lymphocytes, was amidavir neither mutinotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical routine using AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, in clinical studies, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients either during the administration of Agenerase after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity at young, who were treated at an age of 4, showed a high mortality in both cases when treated with Amopavir animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly less than (rabbits) or significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dose when humans lay, however, a number of minor changes, including thymus-ongation and minimal skeletal changes, were observed in a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules can be applied without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses need to be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Ampravir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Amitavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should occur in patients with weak or light liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, like Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International standard debt), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2231">The approved indications, External cores, Actinent Keratosis, and Superfizial basal cell carcinoma usually occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not studied.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream has been examined in four randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials for children aged 2-15 years with Molluscum Contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown to these studies in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic recording of 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest pharmaceutical concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betrugen 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application on the face (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was around 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-year after the subcutaneous application in a previous study; that shows an extended retention of drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod based on MC-ill skin of patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable with the adult keratosis or superfizial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in the rat caused doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg. kg, a significantly reduced body weight and increased milz-weight; a study found for four months in the dermal application showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice at least three days a week induced no tumors on the scope of application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and not mutagenic, is a risk of human exposure to human exposure as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours came in the group of mice that was treated with the actual free-cream, sooner and in greater figure than in the control group with minor UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, however, mainly the safety of medicines has been investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured by reducing Gag concentrations in urine and in terms of the size of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme reduced the Gag concentrations in urine around 60%, and half of the treated children reported a normal large liver in the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arrests, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion place.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side-effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), speedycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and refined.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react heavily sensitive to Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update every year all new information that may be known, check and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of aldurazyes will receive patients who obook Aldurazyme as regards reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. to approval for placing Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using the use of Cho-Mammtier cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term encycline therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mukysacchariot I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a physician, who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased, all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults aged 65 years was not determined, and for this patient does not recommend any dosage scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions, which are defined as each in the related side effects, which occurs during fusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also remain engmaschig, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be in a reasonable clinical field, in which resusability for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, almost all patients can form IgG-antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients that develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction, must be treated with caution in application of Aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, it must be cautious due to the theoretical increased risk reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretika) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of slight or intermediate induced reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be avoided and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion should be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be awaked.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen or / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate that occurred in the previous reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interferences with the intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, who were exponated to Laronidase about the breast milk, is recommended, during treatment with Aldurazyme do not satisfy.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects in clinical studies were classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted pharmaceutical reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, who were observed during the Phase 3 study and of patients with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequent (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some cases with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in the prehistory there were also heavy reactions, including bronchospasm, respiratory-lactness and facial expressions (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable pharmaceutical effects in connection with Aldurazyme who were reported in a phase 2 study involving 20 patients in the age of 5, with predominantly heavier blockage and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients there occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment of a seroconsignet, most of the patients under 5 years with a severe debit version (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (and up to a premature retirement from the study), 13 / 45 patients had not been detectable by radioimmunopacicipitation (RIP) assay demonstrable antibodies, among them 3 patients with which it never came to serum.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low-antibody mirror showed a robust reduction of the Gag mirror in Harn, while patients with high antibody titres to set a variable reduction of Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal until small neutralising inhibitoral effect on the enzymatic laronidal activity in vitro, which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies appeared not to stand in connection with the incidence of undesirable medicines typically associated with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The justification for the enzyme therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the cumulative substrats and the prevention of an accumulation of accumulation of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After an intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the Lysosomen, the most probable via Mannosis-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study was investigated for 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were recruited from the mean phenotype, and only a patient reported the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcapped expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters to go.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy was the percentage change of the FEV and the absolute route in the 6-minute moments.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Althirazyme every week (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme patients to the placebo group showed an improvement of the lung function and the ability to be displayed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The acceptance of the FEV's expected increase in terms of this period is clinically significant and the absolute pulchina increased further proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatitis atomic treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease in the Gag mirror at the Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was determined until the end of the study remained constant.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients that summarizes clinically significant changes in five efficacy variable (up to expected, percentage of shoulders for five patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">There was a one year-old open phase 2 study carried out mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were enrolled at the time of their inclusion in the study below 5 years of age (16 patients with severe debit) and 4 patients (mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased because of elevated GAG- mirrors in the Harn in week 22 of the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and all 4 patients with mean follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with mean follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form is considered limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, examinations on pharmacic dynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dock schemata were carried out on the Gag mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute test test.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is used to treat patients previously not treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously used other chemotherapies compared to several therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To decrease side effects, patients during the treatment with Alimta should have corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered along with cisplatin, or after the administration of Cisplatin, an "antiemetics" (drug against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a liquid mangel).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or where specific side effects occur, the treatment should be lowered or reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Consequently, the active form of Pemetremixed slowed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetremixed in its active form is easier to outfit in cancer cells than in healthy cells, resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of medicinal and longer duration of cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothelike, Alimta was studied in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study enrolled 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously treated with chemotherapy was compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months, compared with 9,3 months of initial administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received a chemotherapy, the average survival compared with Alimta 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients did not attack the squamous cell count, with the administration of Alimta prolonged survival times than with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. approved approval for the placing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each flow bottle needs to be raised with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml), which yields a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data for inconcubility and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, patients with a creatine-in-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not need dose adjustments that are recommended for all patients recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinine Clearance of below 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function of &gt; 1.5 times of the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminase values (with metastases of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit (in the presence of liver metastases) was not specifically investigated in studies.</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophilarage, thrombozytends and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they have been observed in the previous treatment cycles. (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 hematological toxicity such as neutropenie, febrile neutropenie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was considered a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients with pellets are necessary to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophy- lactic measure for reduction-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) must be avoided for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and minimum 2 days after the therapy with pemetry (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is required if patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and minimum 2 days after the therapy with pellets (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data concerning the editorial potential as Piro- xicam or rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the infant status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti-anagulants and antinetic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International standard of Ratio) when the patient was taken to treat patients with oral anti-anticulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as in anti-de- antimetabolites are expected to be severe birth defects during pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies show no direct or indirect harmful impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and hangs with the pharmacological effects of pharmaceuticals, since the absorption of genomes fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), and with chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosterols (an medicines that can be used as antiemetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because the effects in this age group isn't enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient preventing a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), preventing the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi in 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the new trigger for nausea and vomiting are 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared with 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">At a comparison with dagetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with strong emakers, due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting patient chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosterols.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can extend the colodarage, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored according to injection moulding.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Like with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful when developing Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is prolonged or which tend to be such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, in the days of chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials, Palonosetron did not inhibit the five studied chemical therapeutics (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cymbabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose Palonosetron and a steady concentration of oric Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Based on a population based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodaron, Celecoxine, Suroxetine, Suroxetine, Suroxetine, Surya, and Terbinafs, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences about the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not necessary, therefore Palonosetron should not be used for pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were most frequent during a dose of 250 micrograms to observed side effects (a total of 633 patients), who were at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headache (9%) and fruit-pation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience report.</seg>
<seg id="2628">Similar results in the group with the highest dosage showed themselves of adverse events such as in the other dosages; there were no dose-effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis probably does not have effective therapy with a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomized double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of doxorubron (half-time 7.3 hours), given an intravenous day 1 without Dexamethason's intravenous day.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine, and 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosetron, received 32 mg of Ondansetron, given to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with heavily emacitive chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the action of the ventricular De- and Repolarisation and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.v. administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous gift following an initial decrease in the plasma centrist, a slow elimination of the body with an average terminations of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma centerline (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally consistent in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After an intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg, each second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 Hodenkarzinompatios between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increase in Palonosetron Plasmaconentric (± SD) in 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">A total exposure of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached a total ratio of 0.75 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), however, the Cmax was higher after the inclusion of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys, and roughly 50% are transformed into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonist effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies of Metabolism, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, CYP1A2, and CYP1A2 are involved in metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron reported about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unchangeable active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous Bolusintion at the time the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In fact, in patients with severe liver function, the terminale eliminationshalbumen and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies were observed only after expositions that are regarded as sufficient concerning the maximum human exposure, which suggests a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of pre-clinical studies show evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion-channels, which can extend at the ventricular De- and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose was given in approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to a higher frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasty (thyroid, pituitary gland) and skin tumors at rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the very high doses and da Aloxi used for a unique application, the relevance of this results will be evaluated as for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative expertise issued by the approval of hepatitis C medicines provided by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug named rocking-A with the same pharynical component, which is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference practitioner.").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-curing) hepatitis C (a virus infection caused by virus infection.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue has damage caused, furthermore, the values of the liver-encils Alanomaminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood-standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene was applied (DNA) that stimulates the formation of the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon expressed data prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient, composition, and purity of pharmaceuticals, mode of operation, safety, and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">The study of hepatitis C patients with the efficacy of the reference arzrate was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of treatment (i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were largely expressed, that the data for the stability of the active ingredient is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with Hepatitis C, which was applied to the treatment with Alpheon and Row-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was again applied to more patients than with the reference physician; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that the test was used to investigate the question, to what extent the drug is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (one with crust formation) and small infected Lazerations (kniss- or carwounds), amortisation and paralyzed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections that were detectable or presumably caused by methicillinhylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo could not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients with the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should investigate the patient again and investigate alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosomen (the parts of bacterial cells, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicative of effectiveness was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was reversed after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients undertaking the treatment to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin twins, about 90% of the patients were treated for the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, Altargo was found in the treatment of abbey (eited hollow cavities in body tissues), or of infections that were detectable or presumably by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a maturation at the place of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, depreciation or paralyed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the marketing of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients in which there are no improvements in two to three days, should be considered once again and an alternative therapy is considered to be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of Sensitizing or severe local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be canceled, the anointing carefully and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be applied to the treatment of infections where MRSA is known or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical trials with secondary severe wounds was the effectiveness of Retapamulin in patients with infections which were caused by a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after 2-3-day treatment, no improvement or deterioration of the infected place will occur.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of concurrent application of Retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low surface centralized, which were achieved with the cutting of topical skin or infected wounds, a clinically important inhibition is not expected in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the medium Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after the topical application of 1% Retapamulin salbe on the diced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure of patients with regard to topical use in patients, dosages are not required for patients when topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproductive toxicity after the birth and are inadequate in respect to the birth and the federal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the application of Retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In decision whether the breastfeeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated, between the benefit of the nursing infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for woman's infant.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was applied, the most frequently reported side effects of the administration, which was about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction with a specific binding point of the 50s subunit of bacterial Ribosoms, which differs from the binding of other rijal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the bonds of rijales protein L3 is involved and in the region of rijal P-Bindings and the Peptidyltransferer center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding place, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptidyltransfer, partly P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s-bosses subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance, Retapamulin application should appear in at least some infections that should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-response to the treatment with S.aureus the presence of trunks with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidentally) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults was raised 1% Retapamulin salbe on intact on intact and uncover skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamulin Salbe received twice daily for 5 days of the topical treatment of secular traumatic wound, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed in 3 or 4 in adult patients each before mediation and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording on humans according to the topical application of 1% salbe on 200 cm2; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism In vitro-oxidative metabolism of retinopamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">Studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out across 14 days, were signs of adaptive liver and shield changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro-examination on commutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma-test, respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-microkernels to the in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rainfall for female rats at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, making it a maximum exposure of exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2) and dicated skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxin study of rats, ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the ≥ 3 times of estimated human exposure (see above), development of development (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmaceutical application system present (version 6.2) is present and works before the product will be marketed and used as long as the product market.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for the placing on the market is obliged to perform detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical studies, as described in the 1.8.2 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for Human Resources," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Maturation or other signs and symptoms to be treated, you should finish the application of Altargo and speak with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Apply no other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface, which is treated with Altargo, if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in eyes, in the mouth or in the lips, in the nose or female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the lounges look at one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if Complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After being wearing the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gazevertape, unless your doctor may not cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic bag that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of salt, or in an aluminium bag that contains 0,5 g of salt.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases, which concern the liver) for children between the ages of one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination program, whereby a protection against hepatitis B is only reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix is only used when immunization is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the vaccines existing from two doses can be led to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a collecting dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or a different hepatitis A- or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing it to the immune system (the natural resistance of the body), "as opposed to sickness.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens than "strange" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix adults and which has been approved since 1997 of Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same disease, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination program.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicative for the efficacy was the proportion of germinced children who had developed a protective antibody concentration after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix introduced a month after the last injection to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100%.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of ambiance was similar to a six - and at a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observes more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headaches, appetite, pain on injection, redness, maternity (fatigue) and maturity.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react sensitively (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a approval for the placing of ambirix in total</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the Grundimmunisation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a flange is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the respective monovalent vaccines or combined with a combination-simulating agent.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B-virus (anti-HAV) antibody and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody responses were observed in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not completely secured that immuncompetencies can be addressed as protection against hepatitis A- vaccination as protection, as they may also be protected against immunological memory by an immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injections according to the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, the corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization of hepatitis B is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, there is no sufficient anti-HAVING and anti-HBS antibodies, so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccination can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimum implications, these injectors should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombozytopenia or blood clots, Ambirix can be injected by subcutaneous in these cases after intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of a separate injection, tetanus-, azellular pertussan, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, was the immune response to all Antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunosressive therapy or in patients with immune defect must be assumed that no adequate immune response should be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maternal, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparably comparable to the previous Thiomersal- and preservative-containing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccines ambirix were given to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 and up to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination simulator.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions included the higher frequencies of pain and maternity on a calculation basis per vaccination program ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects following the gift of a dose of 3 doses combined simulations.</seg>
<seg id="2755">Following the complete vaccination course, 66.4% of the test persons reported that Ambirix had been given greater pain, compared to 63.8% with the test subjects, which have been vaccinated with the 3-dose combined simulations.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maternity was comparable high (i.e. over the total vaccines working at 39.6% of subjects, the ambirix received, compared with 36.2% with the subjects that received the 3-dose combinations).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The prevalence of predefined pain and maternity was low and comparable to the combination of combined simulations with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambirixgroup was similar to that, with the 3-dose combination-simulated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, at the 6- to 11, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not reported per promoter.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines involving over serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccine schemas with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine schemas with a combination-simulated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B - surface antigen reported, was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were carried out at vaccines at age of 1 and including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6, administered a month (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for the month 6, the dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study that was conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two cans ambirix and 147 were treated with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 people, whose immunogenicity was the serum rates (SP in table below) against Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-tin-material significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunotherapy involving a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds were achieved after the termination of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose-vaccination schema with Ambirix or a 3-dose-vaccination with a combination-simulated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of the Grundimmunisation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAVER and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens was comparable to both antigens, consisting of 360 ELISA-units informal inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAVER and anti-HBS antibodies are comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to the 0-12 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose ambirix starts at the same time with the collection of a combined diphthie-, tetanus-, azellular partussan, inactivated poliomyelitis (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps of vaccines, was the immune response to all Antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation was performed in adults, showing the current formulation of similar seroprotation- and napoconversion rates as for the former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both prior to and after resuselect by eye-certificate on etching foreign particles and / or physical changes.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virushaly food and drinks, but can also be transferred by other ways like swimming in water contaminated by wastewater.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, an indulgences face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot protect against infection with hepatitis A- or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are using / your child before the administration of both vaccines ambirix are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus (although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick), a vaccination may not prevent a vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that are damage caused by liver or symptoms that are similar to hepatitis A- or hepatitis B infection, cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have already an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any element of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can occur through itching skin supplements, breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. if you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and usually the administration of the second vaccine dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">For a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccine, the physician will help you / your child from a vaccination with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will suggest you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine, with an reduced content of effective components per vaccination dose (360 ELISA-B-virus and 10 micro-gram of a combined hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine will usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before termination of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes ambition is suffering from persons who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you are weakened by a disease or treatment in your body's own defense, or if you / your child will undergo a hematalysis / underwear.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient, so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Speak to your doctor if you have taken another medicine / enter your child (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you have been vaccinated or Immunglobulins (antibodies) have been given, or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case, the immune response in the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible in different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambition is administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immunglobulines, it is probably that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Normally ambition is not administered or breastfeeding women, except it is urgently necessary that they vaccinated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about particular miscellaneous components from Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2803">23 Informing your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects they have significantly implicated or do you notice any side effects that are not included in this pack.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since the approval of the first approval for placing the market, CHMP has proven that the benefit-risk relationship for ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, Ambirix is only limited to one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with a complete enzymective disorder or with hypertext concentrations (cerebral injury due to high ammonia concentrations).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonoquor is divided into several single doses at meals - blended under the food or via a gastrostomieschi (through the abdominal wall in the stomach-leading tube) or a nose probe (through the nose in the stomach-leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no-comparative study since Ammonogram could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a pseudo-medicine, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also lead to appetite loss, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, pain retention, diarrhea, deflection, nausea, constipation, rash, nausea, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Ammonum effectively avoids patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle to high levels of ammonium.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonolian was approved under "extraordinary circumstances" because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine templates.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzymmangel is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manipulated form (incomplete enzymdefective, which is manifested according to the first life of life), there is an indicator for use when in the Anamnese represents a hyperglycemulation of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow, pills to swallow or for patients with lockers, AMMONAPS is also available in granules.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually prescribed for protein tolerance and for growth and development necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences the ordinary daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early-manifest deficiency of Carbamyl phosphatsynthetase or ornithintranny, or ornithintranny bamylase, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine deficiency deficiency need arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS pills may not be administered with canyons, since a risk for the emergence of Öeagusulzera exists when the tablets are not able to arrive at the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used to treat patients with congestive heart failure or heavier cardiac insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and odementia use only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolisation and deposition of sodium phenylbutyrat in liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS throughout pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous treatment of phenylaculate at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a decreased number of functioning neurons in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be detected if phenylaculate is eliminated in human breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of those unwanted events were assumed that they were not related to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorektic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in conjunction with lactose, severe mortgemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A short dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) was a case of an overdose rate with a accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms occur with the accumulation of phenylaculate, which showed a dossilimiting neurotoxicity with an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylaculate is a metaboliically active combination that conjugated by acetamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is divorced via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea. (both couplings contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore particularly suited as alternative carriers for excredible nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed to produce sodium polyphenylbutyl nitrate between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance to improve the diagnosis, and treatment immediately, to improve survival chances and clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early-resistant form of the disease with initial symptoms in newborns was almost always infist, and the disease resulted in treatment with Peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticking-free analogues for the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By haematalysis, exploiting alternative ways of nitrogen separation (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylaculate), protein reduced Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase survival in post-party (however within the first month of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients, patients came with many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifold form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygos form of the ornithintranillo bamylase deficiency), which were treated with sodium polyphenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits already are hardly reversible, and in some cases, a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylaculate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle, of hemoglobins and liver cirrhosis for individuals as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous treatment of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacus.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oric single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat in tablet form were detected 15 minutes after taking the plasma torrent of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclical disorders or hemoglobinopathies, after different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day, up to 20 g / day), there was no phenylate acetate in plasma in the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, who were treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day) treated in three single doses), the middle phenylacetatconcentrations were treated five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is divorced within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat had not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granulat is either taken by oral (infants and children who can't swallow any tablets or patients with canyons) or via a gastrostomieschen.Alpha or a nose probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences the ordinary daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine, and serum proteins should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early-manifest deficiency of Carbamyl phosphatsynthetase or ornithintranny, or ornithintranny bamylase, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium polyphenylbutyrat, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When Rattened were subjected to phenylacus (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), there came to lesions in the Pyramids of brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorektic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in conjunction with lactose, severe mortgemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea. (both couplings contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore particularly suited as alternative carriers for excredible</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations about the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be accepted, that for each gram, sodium polyphenylbutyl rate can be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some cases, a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oric single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat in granules were determined 15 minutes after intake of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can retain the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">With this procedure, the small measuring spoon is 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the great measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must obtain the medicine for a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, allowing them to accumulate nitrogen proteins after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">When laboratory tests performed, you need to tell the doctor if you take AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">While still, you are not allowed to take AMMONAPS, because the drug may survive in breast milk and damage your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases also confusion, headache, taste problems, disturbances, disturbances, memory disturbances and deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you identify one of these symptoms, you immediately rely on your doctor or with the emergence of your hospital in accordance with the introduction of an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with "acute coronarsyndromen" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example, with unstable Angina (a form of pain in breast-corb) or myocardial infarction (heart attack), without "ST- Hebung" (an anomial measurement value at the electrocardiograph or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who will undergo one PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This may help patients with angina or heart attack for maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at sole administration or in connection with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-anagulans) and GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often have a stable (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a shutter), and they received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, cardiac cases or reascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI, angiox was equally effective like Heparin, with the exception of severe bleeding, where it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied in patients, possibly excessive sensitive (allergy) against bivalirudine, other Hirudine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Moreover, it cannot be applied in patients who had a bleeding, as well as people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is an appropriate replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004 the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd with approval for the placing of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromen (unstable Angina / non-ST-lifting color) (IA / NSTEMI), with emergency response or early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient was performed in another one PCI Express, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the existing PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed again for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a weight of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h minimum for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and effectiveness of a complete Bolus gift from angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">To reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed and the bolt dose is quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT indicates more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that 1.75 mg / kg of infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which can be subjected to PCI Express (either with bivalirudin against ACS), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is given and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is once again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with medium-severe kidney compensation, which included in phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which included the ACT value for 5 minutes after the gift of Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 patients with severe kidney compensation (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bleeding, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anti-anagulans (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI patients occur under Bivalirudin most bleeding to arterial point points, in patients who interact with percutaneous coronarintervention (PCI), during the treatment principle, bleeding everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International standard debt ratio) should be drawn to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bivalirudin will be achieved prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from knowledge about the action mechanism of anti-agulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozyteners), these substances can increase blood hazard.</seg>
<seg id="2910">During the combination of Bivalirudin with Thrombozytenderers or anti-anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostepochar parameters are regularly monitored in each case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies have an impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, debinding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>

<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in patients treated with Heparin resulted in adverse events over 65 years more often to unwanted incidents than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and heavy hemorrhages occurred significantly less frequently than in the reference group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported by extensive application in practice and are summarized in Table 6 according to system classes.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with bivalirudin can be canceled immediately and the patient is engaging with regard to signs of a bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombindings, which binds both at the catalytic centre as well as at the anion of thrombin binds, irrespective of whether thrombin is bound in either liquid phase or on tinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bindings of Bivalirudin to thrombin, and thus whose effect is reversible, because Thrombin has slowly split the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby eliminating the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes, which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm injected with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not work with sufficient insulin control (sugar) in the blood, or the insulin is not effective in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin isisin differs very slightly from humaninsulin, and the change means that it has quicker and shorter operation time has a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body can no insulin produce, in two studies with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, the body insulin was not effective in type 2 diabetes, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicative for the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance glykosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7,60% to 7.46%) was determined compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin-isper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied in patients, possibly excessive sensitive (allergy) against insulin lulisin or one of the other components, or in patients who already suffer from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can interact on blood glues.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the placing of Apidra into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is referred to as subcutaneous injection, either in the pancreas, or subcutaneous injection or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the field of abdominal bags.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Gluconeogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin resistance, the insulin needs of patients with a restriction of the liver function can be lowered.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Every change of active strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insomyps (normal, NPH, zinkage etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can move a change in the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-dependent diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoper; these states are potentially threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Conversion of a patient on another insulin type or an insulin of another manufacturer should be made under stringent medical supervision and may make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulin-system and can therefore change to change the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enhancing the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the inclination to hypoglysis enzymes, fibrootensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphyl, poalizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effects of sympatholytics such as betablockern, Clonidine, Guanethidin and Reserpin, the symptoms of adrenal counterfeiters be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not well-known whether insulin occurs in human breast milk, but generally occurs insulin, neither in breast milk, it is resorated according to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the clinical trials mentioned in clinical trials, grouped according to system organclasses and, according to decreasing the prevalence of their occurrence (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare (frequency on the basis</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglysis bodies with impessness can be given by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is prescribed by an intravenous person, or by an intravenous gift of glucose through a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Following a glucose syringe, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine matter for severe hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels through stimulating peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as through the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous Golibe of insulin resistance can be quicker than at hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes meric, TUS showed insulin-effective effect of 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg a proportional increase of glued effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the effective effect, exactly like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a double so fast active effect as normal human insulin and generates the complete gluing effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data, it was obvious that during an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a similar postpranal glycemic control is achieved, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Isinglulisin was gearing in 2 minutes before meal, a better postpranal control was given as with human normal-insulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insinglulisin takes 15 minutes after the start of meal, a comparable glycemic control will be given as in human normal-insulin, which is given 2 Mi- grooves before meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin resistance in a gift of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal was given (figure 1A) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal levels (figure 1A), which was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
