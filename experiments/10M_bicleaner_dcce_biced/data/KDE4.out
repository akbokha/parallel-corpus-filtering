to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M &apos;s just displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root icon of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements this root canal .
the Module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be regarded as an alternative for different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists in it that portra@@ yed folders with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ map graph@@ ically . each object is represented by a rectangle , whose size is proportional to its size . this size must possess that the sum of the size of the arranged objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it . consequently , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphical and interactive version of &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap presentation represents a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for sim@@ pler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles and adjusting settings .
the color of an ch@@ equ@@ es , which is switched to color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the coating depth or the illustration of another file size such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rectangle may define a rectangle with the different characteristics of the respective file or folder . for each property you can indicate whether it is possible if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ances are used or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles can be used or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ated rec@@ tan@@ gles can be used or specify the relative position of lettering in the rectangle .
when adjusting algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should normally be adher@@ ed to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this target is not always available . note that less space is lost for the frame if the square is square .
as parti@@ tioning of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will always be easier for labelling and to avoid space loss by frames . the best methods of this are possible , columns , or recur@@ sive second .
you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry above the menu entry . instead , a R@@ aut@@ en@@ pattern is drawn in the area of the superior entry , to indicate that this area is actually assigned by sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .

&amp; digi@@ tization ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supported by the Picture Transfer Protocol , a wide @-@ spread protocol that developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it enables the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator . since photos in general large files are inter@@ locked , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . you can find a complete list of supported cameras under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to have been created with li@@ bex@@ if support . if the EX@@ IF support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators . if the EX@@ IF support is not included . if the EX@@ IF support is not possible , or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in digi@@ plug ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Interface Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view is to provide the modules for all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way such as it can also manipul@@ ate . their advantage is that it is much sim@@ pler , &amp; digi@@ ch ; by writing a small module to complement the changes in &amp; digi@@ plug ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctrl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images anywhere : you can drop a picture in another part of the al@@ bau@@ d , over the horizontal partition or another application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not in keywords , data list or searching .

what is a digital inventory management - beyond the process ? digital inventory management considered every part of the process as follows the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or digital photos , but most of us do not make it in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures , you will find , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , remove , convert , group@@ ing , backup , as@@ ch@@ words , backup , waiting and export@@ ing image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes on , inde@@ xed , categorized , search , search , preser@@ ving and exported content which have a mon@@ et@@ lar or cultural value hab@@ en.@@ quot ;
met@@ adata is defined as data on data . met@@ adata is provided in accordance with your definition , information about or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I &apos;d be able to claim more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you don &apos;t want to save and secure archiving on you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and need to be organized anything in your system . your image files must be organized somehow on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them on your computer , whether you need to change it on a reserved drive or switch to a network run &amp; etc ; notice that some@@ time you need to change to a larger drive .
perhaps you &apos;re happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly on your location . if you have enough photos , then you &apos;ll be able to use sub@@ folder like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then import a folder for pictures which print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant assign@@ ments to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % work files and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack processing simple . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you &apos;re looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ adata to store the met@@ adata in the installation page . if you forget that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file , then you can manually select the met@@ adata from the database by clicking the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? it represents a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work begins , as you should select any photo keyword , cap@@ tions and evaluation . of course , you can choose the same attribute . you will start the best with the evaluation or the ranking . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s take us now with keyword , keywords , how to continue with other programs often hot , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catal@@ og@@ ized images from a different source with embedded keyword , then the tree for you can set up the images to the right place . the modi@@ fying the hier@@ archy is no problem and can easily be done by removing a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keyword is being pursued by &amp; digi@@ tised ; updated during it the under@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is over@@ lap . this is a very big representation since each block of met@@ adata in the truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data shows properties of all pictures .
enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to catalogues your met@@ adata .
don &apos;t want to watch any@@ body &apos;s photos , you want to share with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos .
look at this panoramic view . from the distance it is not even a nice beach panorama . if you are looking closer look at some details , people , place .
and now I say to you these of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y , 60 years after landing , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the label so you can even change your perception of this panorama .
for others , consider their photos may be more important than the image itself to produce a story . if you &apos;re using images , you should tell a story about to help Him to help Him to understand what you move about the motive that you understand what you understand .
it is ok , if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can export a lot of text in an international alph@@ abet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as a label . you can even export your images in web galleries , then these labels will tell you for your desired images in web galleries . you will have to tell it a second time for opening images .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different town without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train leaves the spatial presentation now with light speed .
the possibilities the ant@@ ol@@ oc@@ ability are already inn@@ umer@@ able and will soon be deeper in the future . I &apos;m also able to export your journeys with ge@@ ographic information . however , you can also export your travel to Gall@@ er@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google Earth maps .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a Word Game with Copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of other .
the following description tells you that information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes can be seen as information :
author ( syn@@ onym of author and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has been created , then the name of a company or organization is to be used , then the name of a company or organization should not be changed once . this field does not support Kom@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the title of the photographer . examples of this field may be entitled : employee photographer , free @-@ lance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the Autor@@ en@@ feld , this field must be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors ) : use the bi@@ d@@ eter field to identify who this photo . if the photographer works as Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations can be shown here . if the picture is an image , then the group / agency will be shown here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is not a bit more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator , this is a bit more important than basic met@@ adata . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ professionals this protection is very important .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire . this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which has reasons for data loss .
in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you can &apos;t have any more than a few years . of course , you can also hold your CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ v@@ quality . of course , you can get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 pieces that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe it is in your meas@@ ur@@ able room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk into the right way . the best DVD Capture Devices are not much more expensive than the cheap@@ est , but you write much reliable . it is thus turning the right .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for mistakes , even if you just have been written . 75 % of the data are only effective for formatt@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they need them through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster &apos;s apparently wonderful works on CDs and DVDs . it &apos;s also running for Mac@@ s . it &apos;s also not available for Mac@@ s . it &apos;s also not available for Mac@@ s , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save the format @-@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD containing 8.5 GB . everything was also said for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn your data back to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ binding format . check out the media with a description , date &amp; author markings before and then copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
dis@@ course manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . your production of production include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a big field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks : disk study
in brief : under the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C , the error rate increases significantly . electronic parts of the controller are boo@@ sting this error . some of SMA@@ RT confirmed this error . these are especially readers and publishing houses . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only about the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also use data loss due to a power if you have the files without any major problems .
while most of electrical devices does not matter much , what can cause devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause heavy damage to your computer . thus , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause damage and other defects , so protect mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself to a loss of time and money .
the most popular protection against power sp@@ ikes is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absor@@ bs a part of energy flash@@ es and is normally available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that every plug @-@ in bar contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should ensure that it guarantees the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . they should also ensure that it protects against flash r@@ ash and thereby protecting the connected devices .
since a over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should also ensure that all periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable modem , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for co@@ axial cable of cable modem and television .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for traveling .
while a over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ voltages , these devices can provide automatically battery energy when running a power failure . if you want to run your data and run the system . if you want a UPS , you should be sure that they should get the same quality standards like a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software will be interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its security in rapi@@ ds with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection may be used for less than &amp; Euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference . at the end you should always remember all the cables . you should go back into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can connect this as a drive to &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any data on data .
in comparison to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB cost per dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost per dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it &apos;s not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provides online storage services that are limited to photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked only in reality .
from the perspective of the data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are adjusted automatically and with the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . therefore they are Des@@ p@@ aving certain .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission chain in calculator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to data transmission errors . the file system and b@@ tr@@ fs make sure the data integ@@ r@@ arity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when it happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces have occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ troubled . no one seems to think that it should have no protection for it . nobody seems to think about it . the Internet with his TCP protocol is a considerably saf@@ er data away than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses , as they generate interactions within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , thousands of errors are seen per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates back to lower levels . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that soon it is available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started an own initiative with its b@@ la@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it is still using the same protective mechanisms that is used for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not appreciate it ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % when not@@ ebooks were already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the masters . it is limited to less damage as e.g. theft or re @-@ installations ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer than any longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less pr@@ one for data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . here you will find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of investigation process at su@@ dden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided even before the problem has occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : incorrec@@ t , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stops from fundamental physical boundaries . it is that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for that progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go in direction of 10 meg@@ apixel cameras . even if this resolution is very wor@@ sen@@ ed for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics . even DSLR cameras have the optimum range for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or bigger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone affected by any data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by any data loss before you make any more dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size of hard drives .
supp@@ ose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget about aircraft gap : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ umb@@ les are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the entire house .
therefore , Des@@ p@@ aving always means local storage . bring your sigh@@ ting up the stair@@ case , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save the one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files must be secured . this is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy of one time .
differentiation : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup . created a complete moment of torque at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : backup the files have been changed since the last backup . created multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes next with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception , which is only ab@@ get@@ ed and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool which you can easily create on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , I copied only the difference of files that actually happens . this happens and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another op@@ tical medium .
this approach provides you enough time to restore losses and restore . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have a complete examination .
topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC data , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting pictures and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visibility , ... , use of the Internet .
that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that about the period in which you are really interested in you , because they should remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you have to consider everything today . unfortunately , there is no other option to evaluate the current system . every 5 @-@ 8 years , you should ask yourself how the current system are used back@@ wards . the less variations in the past are , um@@ so easier to rate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system , it &apos;s important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite easy : any time when you modify your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the reference pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . actually , this means always enlarge .
let &apos;s go from that you have the scal@@ ability with incorporated , and you want to enlarge a dedicated disk or partition . in * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang it .
/ dev / S@@ DC # Source can / dev / S@@ DC # Source can / dev / S@@ DC # Source can be / dev / S@@ DC / MS@@ DS ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record is / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; fixed re@@ size / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can be read , then you can create those yourself . this task will make this task a year sim@@ pler .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use any more .
P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard , but it can replace too much more . it &apos;s loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can provide so many administration information , but not as many as TIFF , and recommend you to store your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as picture format . TIFF can store pictures in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can download your images in this format . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open resource file format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed to use met@@ adata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it also some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to incorpor@@ ate the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is possible to store their data into one file itself . file information will be stored in one file itself . file extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in the original file , too . X@@ MP is capable of converting to problems when linking met@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and image file . therefore , you should consider if you are using D@@ NG as containers and put everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible Online met@@ adata standards in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are using the camera dium , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your repository . this function is not implemented yet .
for a hos@@ tile processing you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut off from other programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them in web@@ gal@@ eries , you can use in MPEG , use in contact form , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section adding a photos to your hard disk , you can already add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album @-@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; use it with the calculator , turn off the camera on the display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tile indicator appears at the bottom . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file rules for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. appear on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you might need to view the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or the met@@ adata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information that can be saved internally by the camera . one symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras don &apos;t have any information available .
the rider met@@ adata shows the internal Metad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer of re@@ mark , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata panel bar , or the image processing . please note that this met@@ adata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easi@@ est way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then select the photos of their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; when downloading , we will not be deleted if you have downloaded images in an album before downloading the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , select the desired option with the standard optional methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button you can download the button . download the button selected as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available now . these pictures have been downloaded until now . in this case , the new pictures have been selected by star in preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you want to download the buttons from anywhere or selected , a dialog with which you can select the target album . list of existing albums will be sorted according to normal folders . details of the folder can be found in the My Computer List . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after having selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ly ; invites the pictures from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera by removing the button del@@ eting . if you want to delete the button you need to delete this first and then delete the delete Selected combination .
note that there are no possibility to restore the photos that you have deleted from the camera . they should not be deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera , you should er@@ ase your camera . if you want to delete the camera . if you want to delete the camera , this is much faster .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaning@@ ful . the file names are usually loaded after the photos taken from the camera . this may be meaning@@ ful if you have photos of different recording sessions into the same album . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time to integrate it into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and spin @-@ based signatures . if you use this latter option , automatically creates a folder per day .
the options during the broadcast opens three further options , which are carried out before the photos stored on the record . if you select the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF data into the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option , you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want another date format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % - % d % H : % M : % M . for further adjustments you should read the command str@@ f@@ time . for further adjustments you should read .
if you are using the camera file name , you have the possibility to change file names in small letters , or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; for a photo is used below the name , which displays the camera into preview . your settings will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ly ; can all information be carried out on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation while processing . not all cameras make this information ready . in the side@@ bar met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t supply this information , you can switch off the picture in original orientation . if you continue off the automatic rotation , use button extension and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera has been done on the date , at which the photo was made available , you can download the picture data . all pictures with the same date are uploaded into the same record . not all cameras represent this information . in the side@@ bar met@@ a data you can read which information embedded into photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , stores &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to change this option . if you want to change this option , use the button extension and select the option Dat@@ es @-@ based sub@@ ver@@ bs at the bottom end of the window .
the easi@@ est way to download photos from your computer to your camera is the button to download . the file selection dialog is available , which you should be uploaded to the file . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ff ; she , where the pictures are uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the desired folder and press OK to delete the upload . images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general concept in this document . thus , it is a position that can be displayed in long@@ itu@@ - and l@@ atitude . the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographer can be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone uses a plane to share an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental pl@@ anners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you &apos;ve got later , where exactly the photo was done , you can open a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; user may wish to document the place where the photos may be loc@@ alized , or simply only to document the position data of a photos .
the question is , how do the GPS data are supported in the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a reproduction of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with GPS receiver . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Kodak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel , but you need to save these data in GP@@ X format as it is the only format which is supported by the module for geographical mapping .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tu@@ tion or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ v@@ ey . it uses the sign related coordinates , i.e. by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ly ; tried to give you much control over his work@@ flows as possible . in order to access these settings , you have to configure the Settings menu , you need to set up in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left .
select Action can display on Embedded preview or start image processing . they then put the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardization identity and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is automatically written for download from the camera operation . this data is also written in IP@@ TC fields .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for auth@@ asser@@ tion : this field should be the profession of photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commerci@@ ally photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description to the Autor@@ feld , this field must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this is not the author when this is a photo agency as such as Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency will be available here , then the group or agency will be shown here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ field . this met@@ adata is not only available in the database and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; this met@@ adata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without lost .
images save as embedded lettering ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you want to read in pictures with the images mentioned in the images . note : in pictures , which already mentioned labels , they are over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ plug .
the Settings page contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse po@@ inters can appear in the main window over a file . depending on selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; fix@@ tures , displaying the file extension to the list and remove any of these extensions , which no these extensions supported by &amp; digi@@ ch ; are igno@@ red by digi@@ plug .
the default settings can be reset again by clicking the button updates on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can then open these settings if possible . some images are then switched on . some images , however , are not available . if you have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use fast computers . if you have one , then you can enjoy better options .
by default , image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch this here if you use the tool@@ bar in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of the image can be selected with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing this view can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are encoded in higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the next statement .
with the P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG @-@ files . this operation decre@@ ases the image quality , since P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a quick machine , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option TIFF @-@ files you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF @-@ images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is loss@@ less .
with the loss of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can easily save loss @-@ free adjustment . even if you have written loss of loss and file size far better than with normal JPEG . met@@ adata was not yet supported , but it was in planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ri , image processing was only one image viewer for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the image processing settings .
the default value is that all the green pixels are equal to sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels of un@@ loaded lines , this option creates a bit soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white is used like the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors won the effect that sub@@ exposed images in four steps . for other cameras this option will be igno@@ red for other cameras .
the standard is the top @-@ light , so the parts of your images are to catch the advanced white in the settings . the setting colors are using some unusual results because they are most advanced in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . most recently , you can try some parts of missing information from the top perform@@ ers .
this is possible , as blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ tised to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white want you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can be adjusted separately for each image .
put the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the default 1 . this may also be done in the image options of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be con@@ serv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process , in order to obtain a complete picture of the part @-@ filtered image sensor , which have many cameras and is known for a matrix @-@ coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ lla .
&amp; digi@@ ab , and D@@ cra@@ w make you three alternatives at your disposal : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Variable Number of gradient ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ cra@@ w , but produces color art@@ e@@ facts on the edges . image in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result .
if you know the colour soft@@ ening of your lenses , you can put the red and blue correc@@ tions values here . this is certainly the best method for a color ref@@ lex correction , since it is performed during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and returns instructions like these again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information such as the colour information of one color space in the others are as precise as possible .
behaviour questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / colour management module with raw files .
color profile folder , click here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; exam@@ ines these folders then during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ c@@ ali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures are not administ@@ rated by the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturer and model which you are using . not all profiles are mounted on the same type . currently , d@@ cra@@ b gamma does not have to match up to 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are more options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ profile , which you can em@@ ulate the image of a device , as your printer can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are very saturated , instead of using the flash@@ ing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and profiles can be combined together . this answer is naturally in@@ officially :
the Canon Profile extension leaves the style for the purpose : F for exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image view and image processing is supported ; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . then you want to use and these are loaded by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ers . these modules appear as new entries in the menu &apos;s menu and also refer to some of the menu .
Short@@ cuts for tasks that are done by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ti@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ bs can adjust the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switches on the met@@ adata respectively , which are lit at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera properties show a list of all @-@ time supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to identify the camera properly . currently , you make sure that the camera is properly connected , enabled and in the image line mode , below are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can place the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera from the camera box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / g@@ ging , specify your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you have to connect the camera to your computer , switching it to the display mode and switch on .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera will automatically detect . if not , you can set up camera models and port manually . after you have set up camera models and manually , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras from the main window . if you have more than a camera , you can insert it here .
with the option Order dialog for the shift of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can adjust the discussion of &amp; digi@@ plug ; for del@@ eting a photos in an album . here , you will find further details .
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be used tac@@ it by &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you use the option to switch changes to the right side@@ bar without any request . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button modifications .
it also allows you to display the display panel of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when starting , this accelerates the start @-@ up and digi@@ plug .
if you &apos;re looking for new photos to look for new photos , digi@@ plug for new or deleted albums or photos . if something from the base folder was deleted , then asks &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ff , she asks if it &apos;s deleted from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be found under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be seen below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in making a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; you will find more information about this tutorial in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can view it to view your photos and to the correction or improvement . image processing can be started with a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or selection of entry displays / editing .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of which are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; therefore , they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the image processing section .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , no the functions will change the original photo before you want to save File Save or button store from the tool@@ bar , if you cannot recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
you should definitely make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file saving as desired .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image from the menu or restore image processing in tool@@ bars . you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since last saving .
almost any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . last promotion , you can easily restore , editing or restore , editing and restore editing from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should review the short@@ cut , Ctrl ; -@@ z , and Ctrl ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you push the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the course or rest@@ oring button in the tool@@ bar , select a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are made between again and restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image r@@ under or the entries in the menu file . if you want changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to back up .
you can zoom in the photo and zoom out in the tool@@ bar Ctrl ; mouse wheel or tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar or use the entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you do not want to use the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can change the tool@@ bar here . if you do not want this , you can call it from &amp; digi@@ plug ; see the section to set up image processing .
if you want to print the actual picture , you can print it in the menu image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can print the settings before using your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole sentences from your selection . you just need to select images with the standard methods and select from the album album Export printing assist@@ ent . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug ; main window has a page bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , also in the image processing , it is displayed if one of the five riders are cli@@ cked :
multiple click on the same tab the side@@ bar will disappear or disappear in the edge .
in the inscription view , you can insert the mark below . note the note below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications you should consider that restrictions .
after you commented on , use either the button user or change simply to the next picture , the labels will then be saved .
besides the user @-@ button there is a button More . you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , this is always done if you have chosen a met@@ adata setting , which is always written in the pictures .
the Assessment section shows an evaluation schema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . in order to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , choose them from and use the context menu .
the evaluation will be written in the IP@@ TC field . encoding follows the schema in the following table :
the keyword view reveals a search box for the keyword of the keyword , the keyword @-@ tree and a selection box with previously used in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ session requested keyword .
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search result . you can easily restri@@ ct the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many words .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief in the input of keyword . if you have different passwords , these are stored for quick access .
words can also be placed by marking the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords are stored into the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword @-@ tree , this is only applied to the selected image and not to the entire selection if you want a selection with a keyword , please refer to section keyword filter .
the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window . normally , one or more keyword filter is used on the right side , only the inter@@ section of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop into the main view . if the keyword exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and then click on the selection . then a dialogue which you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter stands on no keyword . they were selected using Ctrl + a , and afterwards a keyword will be taken into the selection and put there . a dialogue asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it can be one or its , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the field of control .
( 1 ) : entry in the database is being sought . this may be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or character string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify a Extended search of all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to configure options , you just need the check box at the end of the rule , and then go to the button group@@ ing . the options are as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r ? free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written mostly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mostly used to digi@@ plug ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you have a color@@ less workflow , which have a predic@@ table deviation from actually recorded or scanned colors . with a color@@ less workflow , you can easily print the colors on your monitor using your camera or sc@@ anners like the colors that you can print or publish on the web from your digital night@@ club .
if the theme is on colour administration , everybody wants to know what buttons does not want to make the results . unfortunately , the point of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color administration . additionally , you will provide you with deeper information about color administration . additionally , you will get your own informative decisions and get the desired result .
if your image work@@ flows are fulfilled every six down of the criteria , you must not take care of colour administration .
you are working on a monitor that is calib@@ rated at s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information see below )
your only other image issues are sent via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for all so simple , why should you use another color space , and do your thoughts on colour content ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB by s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see , the hu@@ gh @-@ shaped region , and the colours in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger bul@@ lets , you &apos;ll visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excellent site and click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to change my monitor ? if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! if you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to run your monitor , as s@@ RGB , you have to run your monitor . if you &apos;re working as a monitor of s@@ RGB , you have to use your monitor on s@@ RGB @-@ standard boxes , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use an ongoing manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , identical , automatic adjustment , and contrast , enlarge Automatic correction to automatically create the best . they will have to experiment the best with these effects , which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is scalable over the entire picture , so the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without his color sh@@ aded . this feature is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
the same : this method adjust@@ s the brightness of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the int@@ act of an image , sometimes produces it only rub@@ b@@ ish . it &apos;s a very powerful surgery that causes a very mi@@ racle during a picture or it was destroyed .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the rotor , green and blue canal . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast @-@ contrast : this method improves contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture by sliding the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white th@@ inks of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to carry out a white right @-@ off photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is limited to some color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . in case you can perform areas with over@@ exposed areas . in case you can perform the white immediately in the raw mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities will fall better to the correction .
this tool is based on a white @-@ equivalent algorithm protected by the laws of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . it will launch it through the menu entry colors white comparison of the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in the size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the tool is adapted . if you want to see the design of the tool . if you want to see the original box , then it is enough to see the window .
the preview of the target pictures has a red mark@@ ers . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this mar@@ ker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above is a hist@@ ogram indicated that as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixel are very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or sum will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , saturation and gamma . the sh@@ adows adjust you to improve your photos or down .
An@@ stat with the above controls are used , you should use the colour temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then anywhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculation the colour temperature of white @-@ equ@@ ations . this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values automatically .
in addition , you can set the white comparison with the default settings . the following settings are available :
the Indic@@ ator Indic@@ ator increases the colours , if more than a color channel of the pixel is indicated . you will display the combined result in the white indicator . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any attitude of the white @-@ equ@@ ate you can now store in a text file and load later again .
the button pres@@ ets returns all the filter values to their default value and corresponding neutral white @-@ equ@@ ations . note that even neutral settings will be displayed another photo than your original . if your original image will change your original image .
you can set the co@@ di@@ fication depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . this encoding needs even more disc space , computing time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF , and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of rough images . color mapping can be performed by changing color pro@@ fil@@ s . color mapping can be performed by the window for use of color pro@@ fil@@ s . a detailed guidance for the use of color pro@@ fil@@ s can be used .
another important tool is available in the menu under color sound . this tool provides an integrated path that allows you to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously . this is useful if your camera or scanner always require the same error . in the manual for audio @-@ correction you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility of coating problems is the tool to count that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug ; General tools displays four colour effects , a solar control effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Ne@@ on effect and an edge filter available .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of which was created when one developed a partially developed pressure of a short flash@@ light . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colours were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar cells . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is finally created , that this is not to generate phot@@ op@@ hi@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar effect effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processes ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Effect . it differs from a saturation which he makes a stronger contrast effect , which makes the colours brilliant and smoo@@ ther . try it easy , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the name of the brand name produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color paints , but also some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those who re@@ covers hardly any landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast channels . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeat the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ light . for large images the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and therefore it is not unusual that you can correct the colour contrast and the brightness in the menu under colors . as soon as you are satisfied with the results you can use the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you make a photo in bad light conditions , you can easily reduce the saturation problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / saturation may take a good choice instead of increasing . all modifications may be achieved when you recommend this result , you can confirm the changes to O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple illumination @-@ strength / contrast / gamma , the tool is very complicated for improvement of exposure . even if dialogue with this tool is very complicated , you need only the slide for the slide . in concrete , the three sli@@ ders under@@ ne@@ ath the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or the selected area . among the graph@@ s are three shooting in the inside , the left @-@ side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas .
the easi@@ est way to learn the operation is to move the kno@@ b and change on it , how the image changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed dynam@@ ically . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the image , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . in images the large areas of a constant color is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in preview of the original image to adjust the input of the shade , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range . there are also two kno@@ b values . however , the output values can be used to modify the output values . e.g. , the compression rate can be used as background to create slightly different in the background .
automatic : with this button , the image values will be automatically set depending on the image values of the image .
save as and load : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be re @-@ adjusted to all sh@@ adows , means and Sundays . if you want to use the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original figure for red , green , blue and lumin@@ esc@@ row .
the over@@ exposure Indic@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and you will find the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the input field applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , and the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed dynam@@ ically , depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel via the module :
in addition to this cheese , two symbols are located between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode has a broad beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps in this case .
for example , if you move a cur@@ vent@@ eil to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that bright tones are correspon@@ dent and associated image @-@ pixel dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original score . create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : using these buttons , you can make exactly this . every curve you can have this file system stored and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve @-@ format .
if you are using this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes @-@ buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of sh@@ adows , medium and sun@@ shine . activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original screen to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure Indic@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will get a indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance canal . shadow and sun was applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer for &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour range of images . you can edit it from the menu @-@ channel mixer for image processing .
you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram with the channel selection box : this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the window of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as opposed to your own rider .
the preview of the finish features a red mark@@ ers . if you are positioning this in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram shows you the corresponding colour value .
the controls for the module are on the right below : kno@@ b for red , green and construction allows you to maintain the appropriate brightness as well . if you can also keep the appropriate color components . this is especially convenient if you have the corresponding colour components . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the green black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color to a visible space , which sees the same spot in the colour canal , and whose cra@@ ckers exists in every channel . if the case is possible , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you can reduce the colored first .
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any bl@@ ender configuration allows you to store and load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer .
the over@@ exposure Indic@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and you will find the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating for your abst@@ rac@@ tion . with the development of digital photography is black / white one step , since colour images can be easily converted to the machine . also with a set of film rolling profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ coating with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ coating with orange lens filters . this improves country , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
rotary filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ coating with a red len@@ tic@@ ular filter . this creates dramatic effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ eness to day time . so , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) rotary filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ coating with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ iat@@ on : produces warm bright and medium tones during a bit of cold in the shadow of a pressure and re @-@ development in a sep@@ iat@@ . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
by digi@@ plug ; tool texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , an old master , a pop @-@ kind portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry picture texture can be used for it .
relief : move this parameter to the right and increases the depth of the depth or three dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper text is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified ( 2 ) to see . the relief model has been set to 200 .
a decorative frame can be added to the digi@@ plug ; a decorative frame can be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not a slight task . to keep his attention it is a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the scattered eye . under image frame , the module can be launched from image processing .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . continuously moving the picture with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , it is ideal for a pop @-@ dimensional frame and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is 1 % to 50 % limited .
this is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio will have greater than the original , but especially if you have used the tool for side @-@ ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert some formatt@@ ed text into a picture at any spot . this is also possible at different places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with your mouse . simply use text size , orientation , color from the color size and the character set . the larger the picture , the bigger one must be the character set . for example , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
every setting you chosen for your text can be modified until you press the button &quot; OK &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
by digi@@ tization ; Tool sten@@ cil allows you to create a template on a picture .
the menu Image Templ@@ ate apply in image processing can be used to place templates across a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . if you want to add the P@@ NG file format and you should add to maximum comp@@ ressing of the file size . if you want to add an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the button base folder . select the folder to you click here . these settings will be notified for the next start .
after the root folder for the template , a tree view is reflected in a folder &apos;s folder . selection of a folder is updated automatically .
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
Enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture . it will be cent@@ ered to the position of mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button resi@@ des the resulting image . if you want to cut the template onto the entire picture . if you want to enlarge the template onto the whole picture , check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the image and put it on the desired position .
if you want to apply the template onto your picture . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ff ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it &apos;s very fast and simple but it creates especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
im@@ pot@@ ency mask works on the contrast of edges . indeed , it &apos;s not a bit anno@@ yed . you can use it to find atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and he is protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , because he really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized pictures need a correction of sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the dis@@ solution . these elements can therefore be combined into a common color . however , this sharp edges can be printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more subsequently than normal cameras for the private user .
JPEG pictures have often been applied to camera internal loop . images in the raw format should always be shar@@ pen@@ ed in during processing .
some scanner use a shar@@ pen@@ al filter already during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate this , you get control over your picture .
in some situations you can obtain usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing strip . you can correct the menu entry .
they should be careful when the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also strengthens the space . in general , you find further information about the menu entry . you can find further further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too little bit soft . use the tool to correct soft@@ ness with the menu entry , and experim@@ enting something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog gives you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ urred mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove mu@@ er from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help the image to work . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the default values do often produce good results and should first test the effect . if you produce the sharp@@ ness mask to strongly make noise and the impression of gr@@ ates in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is like many pixels on each side of a ridge by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images at best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blank image that is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a split up to the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . one can thus define a minimal difference between the killing of the filter and therefore be@@ fore@@ hand between the killing of shar@@ pen@@ ing , and therefore be@@ fore@@ f@@ law@@ ed errors in face , sky and water surface .
this is an example of the un@@ bl@@ urred filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ foc@@ ate re@@ focus on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to use copy@@ righ@@ ted protected filter @-@ algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to explain a photo to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused on the photo . this is better to shar@@ pen@@ ing the photo . re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing usually better results than bl@@ urred mas@@ king . you can start re@@ focus from the menu by calling colours re@@ focus in image processing .
in practice , the circular saw is much better than the pal@@ ate &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , depending on which the mathematical result is far from the original pixels , which is far influenced by remote pixels , which causes un@@ wanted results in most cases .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should place 1 good results when your image is very un@@ sharp , but if your image is very un@@ sharp .
correlation : an increase of correlation can help increase arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sh@@ ielding effect of the module .
noise filters : increasing the space filter can help you reduce art@@ e@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are generally helpful . however , the image value is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad@@ ly . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will still increase the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying ar@@ art@@ e@@ facts . in most cases , you should increase this value to 0 , so you may also increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ sh@@ ness filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformer size . however , an increase in matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters will be stored for you later and then can be loaded .
try to perform all the cutting , colour and int@@ ru@@ sion gra@@ c@@ tures on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture . the reason is that much sur@@ geri@@ es changes are not visible immediately , but later left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you are reading images and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; to JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , bl@@ urred mas@@ sively produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this might be causing un@@ sharp mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of un@@ belief . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the automotive focus lens .
for more information about the method@@ ological structure in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the kno@@ bs glasses set the sharp@@ ness of the range of the dar@@ ker to generate a more natural cl@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ te allows the fitting color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools designed to remove the art@@ e@@ facts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
this algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ adjustments for starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab glasses and advanced settings .
detail @-@ keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing about the image . what is needed for greater values mainly homogen@@ eous regions and details . a value of 0.9 should be required . please note that the details should always be subject to accuracy dependence .
direction @-@ dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes even@@ ly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film @-@ like or CCD smo@@ kers will produce a high value of w@@ avy @-@ like patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts will be removed at a value close to 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ es@@ . p defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value therefore to the degree of space in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . this is necessary if a lot of space is higher when it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is running . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen , then you should also choose a long runtime , so you should choose this value as much as possible and un@@ acceptable for your needs .
integrated step@@ per span &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel glasses and never exceed 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the More &quot; quality that you can get by di@@ aling this option is only low . however , it doubles the runtime . we recommend it to allow him to allow him .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected and loaded into a text file later .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast when working . however , it can last very long and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with button termination .
below you can see how image errors are removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
digi@@ tization ; Rob@@ ust is a very powerful tool to decrease image exchange . it uses a protected algorithm created by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selected image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair to the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need additional information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in this tutorial in English .
the image above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined cra@@ ft@@ y that can be removed successfully with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you need only the lower window details and the lower window settings can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is required for the filter . large values increase the time of the filter by the radius and the colour in it is smoo@@ thes and thus adjusted smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the switching distance . this value uses the pixel pitch the filter tra@@ p forward . if it is increased , the adap@@ tive filters can be re @-@ adjusted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer get more or cra@@ ck or dirt .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , you can &apos;t remove the entire noise or cra@@ ck at a value , if you want to remove a weak room or JPEG arti@@ facts without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the light em@@ itting oler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve the picture . these settings don &apos;t influence the smoo@@ ther process by using the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve the picture . these settings don &apos;t influence the smoo@@ ther process by using the details -@@ settings .
gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ ate oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark zones that are typically stronger , however , it also pol@@ ishes the shadow zones .
absorption : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is higher , the edges can appear on a minimum , can remove rob@@ ber@@ y and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . it can remove rob@@ ber@@ y and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for the saving , which you have set , can be saved in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how to change your life how to change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected sum ( 2 ) is used with default settings .
sometimes a picture to cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw a little bit soft@@ ly . use tool to correct soft@@ ness with the menu entry . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo art@@ e@@ facts .
this filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable art@@ e@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to drop into digital , original or subsequent digit@@ alized pictures ; the smoo@@ thing occurs along the picture con@@ tours and thereby maintains the content as it also makes human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for pain@@ t- and tex@@ tual design . algorithm for restoration is performed using a different tool , the image error correction was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ I and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ fact reduces the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are visible in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should be correct .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loading .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast to work . however , it can last very long and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with button end .
below you can see how a photo with a shaped cra@@ w@@ ling can be restored .. The module is applied to a Black and white photo using a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film@@ strip on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and that corrected below ( 2 ) .
here , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can be read on an old color photo taken with a scanner . the scan art@@ e@@ facts have been shown by scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove all photos with a CCD camera , eight were used . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ ens .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are a problem especially when many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the assistant with button dark . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you capture the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark @-@ image to the correct image . please note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark screen and automatically charges it automatically in the next meeting .
the image area and the preview can help you corrected the outcome . the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ fabri@@ cated areas .
choose an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ section : an average of the neighboring pixels is determined . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional Inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block , are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these will then be used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the blo@@ c .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel &apos;s block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the blo@@ c .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel @-@ correction on a color photo taken from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
digi@@ tization : the digi@@ plug is a tool to correct the v@@ ot@@ ation , i.e. under@@ exposed corners that correct the image .
wide angle lens , especially those in mid @-@ sized and large photo format , can not easily illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it can reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ zing will also demonstrate this behavior .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle objects , also with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or less otherwise , otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are created .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s filters and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation into an image that was done without this filter . the tool is protected by a Center@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the supp@@ orter @-@ correction filter and with three further coating of the finish picture .
density : this parameter controls the level of light bulbs at the point of the highest density . the standard density is 2.0 , or random@@ ly compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of v@@ eling . reduce it to compens@@ ate for a little degree .
lamp thickness , contrast and gamma @-@ settings : the editing of a picture with the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ lt @-@ correction reduces the layer thickness of the pixels with these options . the kno@@ b points you only need positive values when you need to increase the settings .
if you want to create a fine re@@ adjustment of the target screen , the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the v@@ ot@@ ting correct correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the image processing in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image and contrast correction was also carried out with the image with this tool .
the digi@@ plug ; linear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gradient is the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or contra@@ sting form of the picture .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but it is applied to the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of magn@@ itude corrected the remote corner to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated .
General : this value controls the strength of distortion second gradient . with negative values , t@@ onn@@ en@@ sic dist@@ or@@ tions can be corrected and positive values are dist@@ or@@ tive distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree . this value affects stronger than in the center as in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; ver@@ tices parameter set the parameter of the parameter General .
zoom : this value shows the image size and thereby leads to the correction of first gradient . negative values improve positive the picture .
bright : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners to increase positive values .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog box with a preview of the distortion correct . the values which you can use for your picture will be stored and used at the next start .
the t@@ onn@@ - or pil@@ low@@ ly correction should be carried out prior to any conc@@ ision or size changes . if you &apos;re making a picture new . if you &apos;re making a picture new and then a t@@ onn@@ en@@ ular correction would be the effect of the folding .
to help you make the best correction to provide you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . in connection , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ en- / pil@@ low distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct dist@@ or@@ tive distortion , the resulting image black edges will be correct . you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or the zoom controller of this dialog .
for most images , the t@@ onn@@ en@@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for a few motifs such as photos from the front , frame and paintings . note that if you keep the camera with the hand , you will always keep a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onn@@ en@@ sic correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infrar@@ ed film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
on the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can see the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can adjust two parameters set film@@ strip and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ ined texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator is changing the amount of film production and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( Chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter colour channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green canal makes it any sense to use the effect on black / white photos , because the colour information are missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter material used on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the S@@ val@@ leys .
the digi@@ plug ; filter film production is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film tra@@ ys on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Kodak Tri @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films mix the manufacturers big silver gra@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film@@ strip effect returns to your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . in case you want to get a tim@@ eless atmosphere of daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photography , gra@@ cious views especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , so you need to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calib@@ rated for the control of the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the gra@@ ins . although higher values are required , if you need more gr@@ ats , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film@@ strip effect on a black / W photo . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity complies with ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings produced the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ff ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and style are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs in order to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thic@@ ker brush are better for large images . smooth or , from the other side looks like , the scar@@ let .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and it is marked with ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smoo@@ thing 17 .
the digi@@ plug ; filter coal drawing has been used for colour and intensity gra@@ dients to produce a cab@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . images of their gradient is very helpful for this effect . if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline what scene you would have to outline . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two kno@@ bs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of carbon label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved further by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving im@@ shapes your image in 3 @-@ D when it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important at the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ful landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork with distortion effects . it uses the protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wavelength 1 : divi@@ des the picture in cells and it can look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
wavelength 2 : analog to the wavelength 1 is dist@@ orted in a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need long time for calcul@@ ating and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with button end .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by using the sharp@@ ness effects . it uses the protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom lens : wi@@ ped out the picture along st@@ ern@@ ed lines that go from a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ cont@@ ex@@ haus@@ tion : the image by rotating the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
range of range : wi@@ ping the image to create a non @-@ focused camera channel . the object seems to be back in the background .
movement of motion : wi@@ ping the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ pot@@ ence of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or pull photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft dis@@ ast@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image soft@@ ly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dream and glossy soft focusing effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portrait , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and sub@@ tle light .
bulk data : wi@@ ping the image by random shi@@ fting of pixels and sim@@ ulates the in@@ consistency of a arbit@@ rary sto@@ oping camera .
intelligent disorder : finds the colour in the image and doesn &apos;t know this without the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects need long time for calcul@@ ating and cause a high CPU load . this calculation can therefore be cancelled anytime with button end .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ping on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a n@@ igh@@ appearance . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
dri@@ p size allowed to change the size of dri@@ ps . because the size of the image is not automatically reduced with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . fish au@@ gen changes the optical effects of the drops in the image .
you can use the digi@@ plug ; image processing a range of free from rain@@ drops . use the option to select the range , e.g. a face that should be free , if you start the filter drops , the area should be free from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ping .
this is an example of the drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through chips or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers Tur@@ ning or Transform@@ ers .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to enlarge is simple . the big question is , how can you find an image bub@@ bles and the details ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a picture has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transform@@ ers size in the menu and enter target values . the dialog is visible below .
the tool for the size is using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ atable .
many image processing programs are using inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; used by the IMA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France , and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
aspect ratio maintained : if this setting is activated , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . this is necessary if a lot of space is higher when it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons save as and loading are used exactly . each entry for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it makes it , but it may last very long and draw a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with button end .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by adding a small colour image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not just a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the image processing is simply simply possible to create a picture with mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the ch@@ equ@@ es . you will see this rectangle below while you move your mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut out . by doing so , you can change the size of this area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle , simply create a new rectangle with the left mouse button .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the cutting machine , use button 1 button on the tool@@ bar and the picture is trimm@@ ed ( Ctrl + + X ) . use the entries File Save or File Save In the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in preview area you can change the size of the ch@@ equ@@ es by sliding the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you will remain in dialogue .
in the tool as aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format width is assigned .
the tool after aspect ratio is used a relative aspect ratio . this means that it always is equal , regardless of whether you are centi@@ metres , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ hi@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons for the selection automatically horizontal or vertically .
below the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the range to the maximum possible , depending on selected relationship and orientation .
the tool as a aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings will be displayed as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of the compositions help allow help to assem@@ ble your images better . those help include : &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like third @-@ party gel , harmon@@ ic triangles is a way to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
Golden Mitte : the golden middle is a spac@@ ing to various natural growth markets like the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the aperture leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is used by the Ir@@ r@@ ational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians , and also used to construct the golden pitch in all times if you &apos;re using your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fib@@ on@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number after 1 is equal to 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . the resulting divider is as follows a visually harmon@@ ically .
the gold centre provides lique@@ fied auxiliary lines if you incorpor@@ ate a picture . these assist@@ s are being exposed down below :
Golden Spir@@ ale is able to achieve good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party gel , the Golden Spir@@ ale provides a smooth line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river .
another rule , the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden coil , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should give something that the eye can be placed in the heart of the composition . this may simply be a line or different objects . this may be just as being without the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the Golden triangles also deri@@ ve from the above mentioned golden coil . its ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the pages of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles can &apos;t place any equ@@ ered object . diagonal to these lines can have a st@@ ati@@ cal object more dynamic .
if you are using golden triangles for your frame , create a effect of professional photographer dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition , which you can &apos;t reach differently .
options horizontal and vertical bars can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button colour , you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines may be invisible . this type enables you to adjust the colour of lines to your current picture .
the Free Rotation is a tool for turning a picture to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens slightly , that &apos;s not exactly vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things get a angle . you can repair it with &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rot@@ ate your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button settings you can set the sli@@ der on the right side of the window . the new dimension of the picture will be displayed on the right side .
at your help the Module Freie Rotation is available for horizontal and vertical line . after positioning the mouse po@@ inters in the image preview , you can fix it on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after turning a picture , you &apos;ll find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function transformation process using image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic feeding . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ ths the image a bit after turning . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ oxid@@ ative transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixing point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is presented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . preview will then be created automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which can help you alter the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas which are produced by transformation in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas which are produced by transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left of the transformed area .
right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the picture is a bit contaminated . for individual adjustment is this effect small but two customiz@@ ations create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you &apos;ve missed the perspective , you get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to ber@@ some is the image to cut out from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectangle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module using transform@@ ers .
drive your picture by using the Horizont@@ al angle and vertical angle . if you push the settings , the angle is displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target will be shown on the right .
to your help you will navigate a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the mouse button to fix the lines . you can now adjust the mouse button to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out , the image will have a bit wis@@ ely . for a single lift , this effect is usually neg@@ lig@@ ible , but two ch@@ ings are thus dou@@ bly sm@@ ashing and therefore you should avoid this .
after crossing the image un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove this is the image using transform@@ ers cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write the formats used by your system and , in some cases , by way of how these libraries are comp@@ ili@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you can edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug ; in most distri@@ butions you can edit .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on their system . but you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; displays only files in formats . this happens based on file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the image processing . you can change this list of file extensions that changes &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section configuration you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to choose to use file format . more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tised ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures based on digital images . thus , redundant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ ed results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the image format , you can read in Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw material converter from &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; accessories .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; supports the loading of rough images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ plug . all support cameras can be seen at the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . all the cameras below shows a brief list of raw formats used by &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported by :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; but it &apos;s not a film processing program and is therefore no film editing program . if you click on a movie file and then it is not allowed to start playing movies . if you want to use a movie file , the &amp; k@@ de ; Settings to playback films to playback the program .
go back to the previously visited album in Chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you go back before .

the main window shows the opened graphics , each in an own window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically . in this case , the main window is empty as in the bottom _ mf@@ oto . in this case , the tool@@ bar is empty as the icon opened file . Click on the first icon to open the dialog .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower image :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the Gra@@ ph is greater than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
the zoom is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below is the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the just in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; loaded file has changed from another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or if you want to ign@@ ore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; you can change your decision later , so you can use your decision later , you can use the menu item settings ; see also , see also .
when you open a graphic file out of a current &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically ; -@@ instance , you &apos;ll open the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; instance , or want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically ; -@@ instance , or want to display graph@@ s in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance .
as with the previous option , you can save your choice permanently , but also with the setup dialog .
with the program start you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well later .
you can also define , as the graph should be split to several sides . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s are to be set on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio maintained , the pages may not be filled in the parts of the graph@@ s .
page preview with one on multiple pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the page re @-@ load has the possibility to specify the behaviour when a file changes on disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can automatically re@@ load a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ loading or ign@@ ore the changes ) or program every time .
the site will open the ability to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically ; specify when a graph is opened in a new window or determine ( graph@@ s in a new window or determine the running session of the already running session ) or determine that every time .
the site seat management gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically ; specify a standard behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or determine if required .
the context menu that usually appears in a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; it opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described in the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for focused graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of stra@@ ined graph@@ s . the algorithm lays down the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or left to right ) and then tries to produce short edges and possible short@@ cuts .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ od@@ lit graph@@ s . he produces represent@@ ations according to the jumping spring model . the cam@@ ada @-@ K@@ aw@@ ai algorithm uses a statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .

read the K@@ IP@@ I Module Pictures at your disposal to include new pictures and cap@@ turing these images .
this module can be used to incorpor@@ ate new pictures of external sources and to eliminate external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan scan : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which is supported by the s@@ ane project or another source such as Video streams . thus , you must have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed .
in fact , if you open the menu entry images , a dialog allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from you want to get the picture . you can also use the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears that you can replace the default value duc@@ ers , in order to select your image , before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will display you in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
note that the window is completely displayed , since some settings can &apos;t be displayed .
after pressing the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is closed and the window will specify the option to specify the picture file . here you can select compression and type of image file . you &apos;ll also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved .
images can also be selected after you select the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di menu on the Import folder &gt; screenshot photos . you can set a window in the menu
select The complete desktop to read in order to include a single window under mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear to view other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be read , after a short delay , the currently visible work@@ station . if you select the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determined how long screens should wait before it starts . if you need to switch on other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time .
after the screenshot of the screenshot , the dialog box options have been published with the options described above .

figure Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alisation Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and then call the menu . to run a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains data back to the same time as images of your camera .
if the file is loaded the automatic correlation was performed in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . here you can use your camera zone .
the maximum deviation for the maximum time vari@@ ance is one of the upper deviation for GPS time and camera areas . the deviation is included . the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace information from one place for pictures , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used when you don &apos;t have any matching data . if you know that in a large difference between camera and GPS , you can use this limits and push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ating .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialogue is to use a call to the next note , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and you will find si@@ e.@@ Add it again , until you have reached an enrich@@ ing accuracy . the card must always be selected manually . the card can be changed manually . the card can be changed manually between card mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang up the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module may export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set will be UTF @-@ 8 encoded to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .

this function doesn &apos;t work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please refer to ex@@ i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG co@@ di@@ fier module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
the MPEG code module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video with a defined length , which allows you to add selected images to M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic configuration file between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically on the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can use a background color for the Di@@ asch@@ au . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you need to check first images that are packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . then you can start the module on ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting pictures or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should be able to adjust the other settings . if you are planning the file on a TV . if you &apos;re planning the file on a TV , you must default the respective TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image transition is set . a low value is very su@@ dden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should set it black . you can specify the name and path of the created file under name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can run it into the film . depending on your computer &apos;s speed , you can quickly or drink a coffee or enjoy the slides of your computer when you are back again .

the printer wiz@@ ard allows several images on one sheet paper to print together in standard phot@@ og@@ rö@@ hren . this combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. : useful to print you or using the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your RAW files stored in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w von Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Dave Coff@@ in is not that it generates the same results , like the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results !
first , choose the RAW file to convert and launch the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the most important parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera has been operating in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and select the Conver@@ gence result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , TIFF , keeps all information about your image and use the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you frequently use your images frequently or later , you should not use JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
if you select JPEG formats , the met@@ adata file contained in the JPEG file are stored in the JPEG file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the button to start the conversion process . if you want to break this process , you can use this process .
the p@@ ile processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to one time . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , they have been able to over@@ write the existing file automatically . that &apos;s helpful if this is created in an earlier attempt . a look is not available as far as conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can set up the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several pictures of an image collection . you can reduce the image using Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . they can be reduced or enlarge the image of the image change :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 d@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen format .
non @-@ proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
pre @-@ preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo printer . the target pattern , including background size , random size and background colour , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it &apos;s also possible to change the size of the images in advance . more images can be taken on the list of these images here .
after having started the module , the pictures will be displayed by you on selected images . you can add a look at a file selection dialog . for the latest image , you can see a preview of the right @-@ hand side .
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and add there to add the list of these images .
from the button to remove the selected images from the list of these images removed .
once you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just need to add the addresses and the header to the subject . photos are attached to you as an app@@ endix .
don &apos;t hesitate to send a lot of images on once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and any time used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path to your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the GM@@ ail@@ agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file the comments will be added to the images in a text file and provided the email .
the P@@ NG Format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to use P@@ NG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you choose to JPEG file format and select the original files in JPEG format , the original ex@@ ib@@ f@@ data will be added to sen@@ su@@ ing images .
when the process is done automatically , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status messages , on the search for errors that can be seen automatically at the end . by pressing the button , you can get this window wi@@ lie ? EN .
after starting the module &apos;s advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , there will be a window with questions such as you want your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all the images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions option in the presentation are used to use very elegant lines via Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the Di@@ asch@@ au will be very slowly .
the File Name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images are displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop allows for this to display the presentation in an endless loop . it can be manually dis@@ rup@@ ted by Es@@ c .
the option random@@ ly choose images that the images are displayed in random order , so it will not be used in the sequence of images in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 millis@@ ec@@ onds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transitional effect . you should let this be the presentation to show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects any other effect between the images .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left of the screen . move your mouse into this corner to shift you .
with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump back to the previous and next picture and stop the slides .
on the left of the screen you can see the current file names , the position of the current picture and the whole number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I Modul Time &amp; Date currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool to set a picture as background image for working area .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of Unter@@ men@@ ü@@ s , as a background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ id album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , so in individuals , places and group words present .
in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current pre@@ views are explained . in the following , each for itself is described .
when you press the mouse on the entry , change the browser &apos;s view . see picture .
if you choose a further person , only the images are displayed on which both people are visible . by this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few individual pictures .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view images to view images of your work area .
in the picture every person has the same icon in front of her name . you can store with &amp; k@@ id album ; however , for every person a private preview image , this also applies to places , words and other categories , which you have defined yourself . see the picture .
in order to display pictures from the name , select the button on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . you can view the view for each category separately ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keyword ) .
however , you must specify that image for each individual person will be displayed . in order to see the image @-@ saf@@ er window ( in closer look ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window you can choose the magni@@ fication factor according to your requirements , which part of the image will be displayed and cut .
when searching for the entry in the main window , a dialog is displayed , which is very similar for the celebration of the image characteristics . this dialogue can be seen on the picture .
if you want to enter a character in the label or description , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the pictures will be searched for this text ; the date may be either part of the complete date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data as for example 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the image , but where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ id album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , rather like functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick release , the screens and the introductory videos .
start &amp; k@@ id album ; and in the first dialogue the Demo , if you start &amp; k@@ id album ; for the first time , or select a menu entry into the menu entry . then , you can download some sample images and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a program HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the Main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . a picture of this bar can be seen here : as the name already says , this Easy tells you date information about the images in your database .
the time bar can display several different time units . each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture , you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute intervals .
the time bar can be interactive to the following modes : you can change the comments viewed from the database ( if you select a date on the date displayed , the current date displayed on the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you want to navigate in preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button , and the mouse over the ruler &apos;s sched@@ ules , i.e. , when you select a range , you &apos;ll notice the selection , by clicking on a log of time bar .
&amp; k@@ id album ; presents two ways to create HTML pages with your images . it is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; integrated and the other as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the following version is described , which you can create file HTML ...
before HTML pages , you &apos;ll need to set some settings . these are divided into three areas of contents , layout and target . in the following , each area will be described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the folder and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ record , HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ id album ; the export file should be created on the review page . next to import information about export files you will find in .
last , you can select which information is displayed on HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . for example , you can &apos;t use any pictures without description . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewing .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like this . most import@@ antly , which is not specifically addressed to this .
below you can set different resolutions on the images . you need to view those who have a monitor and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600 , no images that have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time . so , he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if a picture is larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this area , insert the various folders and URL , where your website is stored .
best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and select a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be automatically added to the location . this folder allows you to select either a folder or from K@@ DE supporting protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can verify that this really all for viewers can choose a web browser after the pages have been created , launched . the URL , which you should click here . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created you don &apos;t have to copy them in the final destination folder , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folder will be found .
the settings described only have to refer to all three on basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub @-@ folder will create , whose name is set in output folder .
if you come to a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images . if you &apos;re already quite a lot of time , you &apos;ll need to add a HTML page for viewing , then you must do with &amp; k@@ id album ; this work did not make even more .
with &amp; k@@ id album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import them to your database . the image features are ex@@ pressing and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they distinguish themselves whether images can be stored in the file or if you have any pictures in the file . the obvious draw@@ back is , however , the file size is file size .
you can select a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or , together with HTML pages , see , create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
one external .@@ k@@ im file sear@@ ches the images on two @-@ fold ways . first , the images are found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . the images of the URL , which you have created when creating HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images are described , which you can export via the menu file ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether to deal with internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , there are the following three selection options :
when you select the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automati@@ cally , copy and copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ id album ; pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , if you want to comp@@ ress the files , so simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is maximum picture size limit . if you send your friends images , you would not want to limit your images , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . here you can tell the size that each picture should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file using the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File file Import ... select &amp; k@@ id album ; export@@ ing database as described in detail .
the assistant to import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you must select what pictures you want to import , then into which folder to import images .
it can be that you can person@@ ell the category people to import file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is necessary for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog box , which categories the categories of imported file are to be imported into your database .
in the fourth step , you can select the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it must be easy to browse and watch images : if you see images , you often want to watch images from different picture sets &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you see images of your Italy vacation , you might want to see images on which this friend is depic@@ ted .
in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) to place the information about your images , through ( 2 ) to browse and pass through ( 3 ) Advanced topics and adap@@ table possibilities .
photo album has been started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual , it also includes pictures , but often includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ id album ; stores all his information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal locking tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S where they want .
&amp; k@@ id album ; noticed the folder where your images are stored automatically and used this in future Star@@ ts . if you want to start another folder with pictures , you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ id album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ albums -@@ c ~ / company / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
using the Settings menu entry into photo@@ albums ; set up to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; please refer to the various setup possibilities in the following section of the user manual .
to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access the preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , you can view a detailed help to call the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
it was described in you how you can set various properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog box that is used to process already existing groups . you can select a label and select a symbol for each existing group .
sub @-@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete membership groups , e.g. all members of a group met once in a group instead of all groups of one centre .
in view of the installation options that are available to you to the fixed list of members . in the left window you can configure the category . in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ record ; share its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface . next information you will find on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called on the module modules . they are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; but most modules have a help @-@ page , which you can access via the modules itself .
since the modules can be used together among others , the modules can be tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; therefore , you should always test new modules with the command database before using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ albums @-@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . don &apos;t say , I would not have war@@ ned !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ id album ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you divide functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; and other applications that are using K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported by albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the order for albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ;
this sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ id album ; the current album that &apos;s just corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that show you the picture @-@ picture .
along with the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; modules can also be delivered a list of albums . here is &amp; photo@@ record ; as follows :
if &amp; photo@@ albums ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set as a category for virtual albums , i.e. , for example , using the category people , will be used &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; so whether you would have chosen persons to view and pass the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ id album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . launch the modules section and choose which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start@@ ling screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ id album ; with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , see the window below and see the tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you can see your picture database . in the section , we will not read more information about your images . in this section , please click on the entry images that shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ id album ; is the possibility to watch any image with notes on the picture , where the image has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of images in particular . if , for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is depic@@ ted and all images taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes may be used for searching and browsers as you can read in the section . if you want to see this comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text field by giving people , places and keyword . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you can always use them when you enter information about your images .
the following idea lies the move of images within the list : if you have shown a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be depic@@ ted , so that the names used are shi@@ fted to the top , which can be qu@@ icker and assigned .
if you prefer a alphabetical list of the list , click the icon for sorting by the list .
if you have any comments to each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and have these images with notes . Click on the right and back buttons that are located under the picture of the picture on the top .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries to once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles , and California are all in the USA . Moreover , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a group . to view it , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the An@@ od@@ ungs@@ dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ category . additionally , you can also move an entry in this entry to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires you to alphabe@@ tically sorted your categories .
you can move the individual elements of the feature dial@@ ogs by forming the bodies that form the edge of the frame , click and move them . you can also move your own window by taking it outside the window range .
if you have adapted the window look at your needs to be satisfied with the settings , click on button Options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current design and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to display this window later , use the button Options ... and here window can be a / out . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you will find an overview with preview images of currently selected images , or all images , if you do not have a filter . here you can see the size of pre@@ views , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you leave a painting on the background of your desktop , this image will be furnished as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is shown in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a view , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image show . simply delete the appropriate images or select either the Edit menu or select from the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed , which you can see in the image .
&amp; k@@ id album ; allows you to have a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; k@@ id album ; namely , images can also be saved anywhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ record . in the image , you &apos;ll see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for example , you can see images on the images 1 @-@ 9 , but you can see the preview of these pictures , however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , you need this function that you want to copy files from folders and do it again . if you want to avoid off@@ setting of the concerned CD . if you want to avoid off@@ setting of the concerned CD , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the menu Images you can find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you would like to have a little more privacy , you can view the images in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can view all the pictures depicting your little sister , and choose the menu entry everything except above view .
thus , you have set out what pictures will be hidden in case of the case . if you want to lock the laptop for your little sister . if you want to un@@ locked the menu entry , if you want to get blo@@ cked , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered for un@@ lock the images . in order to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is not very safe . you can read all images on the hard disk and to others , who can read password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are associated with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; not very familiar , the view on private images .
the reason why you would like to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ id album ; manage and store hours over hours , of course , that you want to look at some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; scores . this is a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but additional information you have shown on the picture , like who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box on the top part of the picture you want to see , so you can configure this simple with mouse and what else can be displayed . all these options are displayed by a right @-@ click on the viewer . so , you can see the context menu .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see the matching entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures from Anne Hel@@ ene . when you chose Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have downloaded several images in the viewer , you can transfer between them and follow the buttons picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , then load a new picture after a few seconds . how frequently a new picture can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus respectively Min@@ us . start and stopped by the buttons Ctrl ; S .
a very useful capability of the viewer &apos;s viewer &amp; photo@@ album ; it is used to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer simply zoom in the picture and zoom out . with the mouse button you can zoom out the Plus button zoom out into the middle of the picture . shows like a zoom @-@ rectangle below and shows the result of the zo@@ oming .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ oming . with the mouse button , the zo@@ oming , so that every pixel is similar to the screen &apos;s screen pixel .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that come in and zoom out with the plus and minus .
you can rot@@ ate the image from the context menu . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make comments about the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you can see images , you can find a picture with one person , whose name can be found on the picture . at that moment , you can view the view and edit the configuration dialog to mark this name . however , it may prefer to mark the image and get more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see images on paper . to see what pictures you want to start with the pictures and get them as good or bad , while you can watch one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to get pictures with features , while they look at . features are the letters A @-@ Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters . in view of the features A , B and C are set .
once you have further features on your images , you can see them in your browser . if you have any pictures , print or whatever you have . this is described here . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want .
here you can view features in the preview screen . if you can view categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can press features to the images by simply press the letters for the characteristic after the picture was selected . here you can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint &amp; k@@ id album ; on the picture to paint .
this is not saved with the image but in the database . on the way you can reverse your gem@@ old later .
in addition , you can see a painting on the painted . for example , select the Mal@@ es from the context menu . to finish the painting from the context menu , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you must not have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire model views .
you can also choose several objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ objects are already selected using the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select menu entry in the menu .
if there are me@@ ats possible positions , the following steps will be embedded , so you can choose the right position :
delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ eting from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button .
if you have changed properties , click on User to adopt these changes . if you specify invalid values , you can disc@@ lose the input errors or retri@@ eve the input errors or disc@@ lose the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter a user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you have a texture or a portion of a texture , you can see a preview of your Own view .
press the entire texture display and a small example of the scene is displayed with the chosen texture . if you want to choose one part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check out locally .
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can pull up these control points with the mouse button , thereby modi@@ fying the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the control points and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by drag with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visual brightness . you can specify this value relative to the visual level of the super@@ ordin@@ ate object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the level of the level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as a pre@@ set . the object tree and view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window requirements , or if you need any arrangement , you can also set them back up to several windows . you can also change between different directives .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the touch to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle below shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the touch to the right or left side of a view . the new view will be an@@ cho@@ red at the right or left side of this view .
if you would like to arrange multiple views on each other , drag the middle to another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the cart@@ els pioneer in top of the views .
the last possible window rules are pending views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , draw the right to the left at the top left at the bottom line .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the asser@@ ting system . to prevent the closing , click the little square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu view , you can find items for any kind of views . new views are pending , you can anchor it at any point .
the current window view can store you with view window settings ... saving a dialogue where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ ders the current scene , click the icon Ren@@ dering The icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it defines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different picture sizes and quality steps , you can insert a lot of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the tool@@ bar icon in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... choose the following dialog box :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but makes sense to recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the box card size you can enter the width and height of the changed image . if you want only a small area of the image , select the check box and enter the image cut into the input fields .
in combination and quality , you can select Properties &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection illumination . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture is reduced with just one beam ever , there are various errors . these images are often displayed a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or level effects in curves and lines , but sometimes details are displayed in representation smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of that error . in general , pictures with this property better look better .
when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the second method is adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adapted for the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; because each pixel is constantly growing and adapted because each pixel depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray has given a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values are processed , both pixels are calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you specify the depth of 4x4 additional points , a grid value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional radi@@ ance per pixel are calculated .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ determined threshold , the pixels will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel which can be examined individually and on further sub@@ division , you can adjust the maximum depth of the rec@@ tal .
another way to reduce the Ali@@ asing effect is called j@@ it@@ tering , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the R@@ ays to avoid a tiny amount to prevent regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate with this property .
on this map , you can adjust if the alpha @-@ channels are calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not taken any object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Kon@@ sol@@ en@@ output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import an &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; Import scene , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in dialog box .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler currently supports the complete start @-@ up of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings appear , a dialog box shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can add objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects into the editor @-@ opened text file in the editor . simply drag the source text in the editor and drag him into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ tion into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can also add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called , if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler is a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
when you click on the Help View , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . specify the path to your documentation and version . versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches for external files ( for example elevation field data ) in the paths to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files , do not have the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the ch@@ equ@@ es for the field of vision in the camera view and in the window types characteristic .
you can set the object of the object in the context menu of wire model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling , and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can set up the detail level for two directions .
if you cross extended proj@@ ections for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model screens are further divided , all proj@@ ections are used with exceptions the perspective and per@@ pen@@ dic@@ tory proj@@ ections . this feature gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross wall , a wall is shi@@ fted behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross bottom , a floor is below the objects . the floor is displayed in a chess pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross cant@@ onal verification , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be set . more accurately about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window sections or create new window arrangements . in the section window sections , you can create and save window boxes .
the combination field standard window rules : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window requirements when starting the program .
the List Ext@@ ant window rules shows all existing window assign@@ ments . you can add a new arrangement with the button adding and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window rules is identified by name . the name must be unique and cannot be empty .
the list below the name lists all the views for the chosen window . new views may be created using button add @-@ on and select selected views by removing the button .
the new window of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ cover the window below the existing window , with incorrec@@ t map , you can &apos;t an@@ cho@@ red a cardboard box with the previous view , but creates a separate window .
so you just have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to create more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should very popular but very popular : a ball at one level .
but you should consider the following war@@ nings , before you compl@@ ain that as a result , you should only use a black screen . if you are using a 3D program , you should consider these important rules :
if you cannot set a camera , no rules for the rendering can be applied as result , a black picture .
when you insert a light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get a black picture .
if you have everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ set window rules :
take a little time to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so you can expect an appropriate presentation of what you can expect from this program .
they are often used to use these menus and symbols , therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and its application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . highlight the scene and then select a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene . in particular , they are in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this is the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the contents of view object properties that find the different parameters of the camera . in the user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please find further details .
change nothing about the basic settings of the camera , this is a later instructions to change , but note that the camera in the view control points you can change the target point of the camera . simply click the right button and draw it to the desired place .
when you press the button user or input , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree will immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could set a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ tion of f@@ ader body qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a thorough method for resol@@ ving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; indeed , it provides a sim@@ pler option . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button . in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire model view now indicates the level even though at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends to the horiz@@ on .
if you can view the object tree on the floor , you &apos;ll notice the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , turning and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just move some of these parameters . select different parameters and adjust the values as follows :
first , choose the ground in order to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit im@@ press at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog box opens in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted as object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground @-@ pigment ) , with one click on the button below you can see how the pigment now looks .
of course shows the preview of the Pig@@ ments just a matte black material , because you can always send settings for the pigment . do you always think you can see the look of materials anytime with one click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you do not see any color on qu@@ ader and ball , click the button and then call the preview button .
the material for the ground is right now . if you have the image now with one click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the colour . you need further settings necessary . in the colour list you have to set two new attributes , called the entry menu . then you can do this entry twice ( you can also do more frequently , but the box ch@@ eckl@@ ist can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select and change the colours in the view of the object properties :
this step should you be able to run , as you have understood the basic mode of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you can already understand the sphere just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the values for the radius ( please don &apos;t forget to push the input or press the button . otherwise , the ball would be bo@@ iled over the ground as you have shi@@ fted the ground to move down a unit .
of course , Ren@@ dering is to see a strange result : as previously , the ball surface appears as a matt black material . put a suitable material in the following step .
if you have selected the ball , you can now show a material now . as in the ground , enter the ball a pigment as color :
choose the bottom object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . Click on sphere pigment , then select Unic@@ ol@@ ored and ask the Val@@ ues as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take time to hire some finish characteristics :
then change the values like in the following screens and click on the user or press the input .
the brightness effect and reflection result already produces good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metallic :
you should now have a good impression that features you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you &apos;ve already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ yc@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to generate a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the Ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical R@@ ays ( i.e. from the camera , which reflects the scenes ) through each pixel &apos;s perspective , and how atmospheric effects of light sources is reflected in the scene , and how atmospheric effects will result in pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye when you see the scene . without a light source , you can see the picture . obviously , every scene is to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously recorded with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file contained in this sub@@ menu will be replaced with the oldest entry in the list .
if your model is already saved , it will be stored under the same name . if you have a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are igno@@ red .
this menu entry can only select , if you don &apos;t have stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last updated command . this menu entry can only select if you have used editing .
stores the current window configuration and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , here you can change the appearance , the keyboard short@@ cut and the standard behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to this option .
opens a dialog for setting up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tools with this option Tool@@ ole for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; -@@ commands and remove .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is an option to mod@@ ulate rough surfaces without changing any diff@@ usion on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be mach@@ ined to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel @-@ based on the application of an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable pic@@ king and browser . the application has a file browser that allows you to display pictures .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return Return .
you can adjust whether each image will be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a matching file name has been found , the file will appear . you can leave the input field using Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and edit and slide show , you can set working instructions from &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , can be set to the respective window .
if this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with background colour . default is no full screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture shows that while you select the actual picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option , stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder opens the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ b show this folder in browser window .
Click on the colored beam to select a background color . if in window mode , it is larger than the picture is larger than the picture , the background with the selected color is filled .
you can show &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default .
set out whether the slideshow will start with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the interval between the image change at a slide show . in order to change the value , enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der and the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ tries is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until they turn from the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .

&amp; show@@ photo ; works a &amp; k@@ de ; photo processing based on &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ ch ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to join its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; it &apos;s just as easy as possible mistakes or possible improvements to report . if you &apos;re using any problems or possible improvements . this displays a dialog with a link . if you &apos;re using this browser , your browser will be completed a page to the reports of problems and wishes . all necessary information are completed , and you can follow the instructions to complete your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , users and developers help each other . if you want to find a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you may soon ask ourselves questions to other users . in this mailing list , you should now be spoken English , you should also be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; it is the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you much control over his work@@ flows as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to set up on these settings . the Settings dialog is set in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color if the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure @-@ dict@@ ator should be displayed if you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposed a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to selected images . you can view it in the image processing . you can view it in one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan pictures , which no longer makes images to scan and cap@@ turing .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan , scan and cap@@ sul@@ s . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to save or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display pictures before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane @-@ project page by clicking the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projected ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; is set to the terminal , or if no standard scanner is provided , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can choose to select the sc@@ anners and press OK to open the scanner . stop &amp; sk@@ el@@ l@@ ite .
further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) will not cover these options .
to get a picture , the user can start a slide can and then look for scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by preview button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom in the picture and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom out so that the complete preview into the window will fit .
if the picture has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if you want to show a preview in the settings , then the image will be shown in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be stored and sh@@ lie ? EN leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get into the main window .
through the button settings the ep@@ onymous dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can see the image if desired , in front of saving . in this case , the option must be selected . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be re@@ elected .
this setting allows you to select the type how &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores the dialog before every cl@@ amped image . when &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens the dialog in a previously defined folder , then you need to store them without a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save file without a file name , then this folder will be stored as default for dialog . the default value is your home directory , and you can change this with button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the image automatically for storing images and is also added to the image in dialog for storing the picture automatically . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to store . this value also changes the compression value for saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is Q@@ t .
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Hand@@ book . the button About starts the K@@ DE on dialogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings display the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs here . below you can set up a list of this pump@@ kin and set their function . clicking with the right mouse button click on the player window and click on the mouse button , click on the right button click on the player window and click on Create Short@@ cuts ...
you may have any existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; -@@ Short commands . by doing so , make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly mentioned in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , etc . :
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should not give a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependence . please check whether all the required modules are present and use case dialog , so that the user &apos;s identification , why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos;s Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the folder , you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ us . the easi@@ est way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each K@@ DE installation should lie .
most scripts allow external programs and commands to run external programs and commands . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here , an example in Python is :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . from this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ign@@ ore events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to indicate the setup dialog . to store the saving and loading of setup files , Amar@@ o@@ ok sets the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ B ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the denom@@ inations ) .
volum@@ etric change volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ is@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title &quot; Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of play@@ list , if a custom menu entry may be used . in order to add the script to remove d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ iz@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; stopped , or if the user stops a script stops , sends &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do such memory . for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script administration can also install script packages , which can be compressed using a web server . such packages are compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be seen with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as the Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly .
the main scription must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ r . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ o@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless simple to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you can simply drag the music into the play@@ list instead of using endless menus . perhaps you &apos;re looking for only a particular title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browser and the quick search you &apos;ll find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have some play@@ lists , you can never decide what you want to hear ? then , the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically set the right music according to certain criteria .
amar@@ ok has excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Rivers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , you can listen to many different audio systems such as you can listen to your music . amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re @-@ see your music !
usually you need to set the Fol@@ lowing folder in the base folder of the Amar@@ o@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ o@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto @-@ conf and autom@@ ake should you be comp@@ ile with comp@@ ile difficulties . if you encounter any problems , please report them into the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has just like most applications which you can activate or disable the comp@@ iling point using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled , that they may be used . for details , please refer to the system requirements .
activ@@ ated Debug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help you in the development of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set without trouble on the installation dialog . the setup dialog has several cardboard cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
player windows show the player window in addition to play@@ list box . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window ( Ju@@ K ) is displayed .
note : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option automatically switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
matching design : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , this function is changed for m@@ ood@@ bar . this is the used color scheme for the mood activity .
tuning files at the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; otherwise ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ ei@@ vable / etc . )
external Browser : lets you choose which browser is needed by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it should be started when a browser is required .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not located in the list above .
play@@ list when saving , stores the current play@@ list automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running play@@ list when running .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list , otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
to keep the pieces visible on the unit change , that the play@@ lists window can be stopped / roll@@ t , to keep the left always in the visible window range .
in order to change the context @-@ browser automatically , automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the appearance of appearance , you can adapt &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is part of three parts .
in the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; otherwise you can select scripts for the following areas : play@@ lists window , player windows and context browsers . press on select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of customized color scheme , you can define the source of choice and allows you to set their own color scheme . please use it , including activated colour choose for front and background colour .
play at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; after program start the playback is automatically set with the piece on the site , with which it was stopped at the last finish .
the window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . Click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD , which shows the text in the O@@ SD .
your own colors are giving you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD @-@ colors for writing and background . a click on the colour area opens the dialog for color cho@@ ices . if own colours are not activated , the pre@@ set colors are used ; -@@ colors are used .
the input field display shows the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by inser@@ ting plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available wild@@ card and what they mean .
the monitor &apos;s option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so you can define , on which screen has a multi @-@ monitor environment to appear on the O@@ SD .
the box card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers also enable additional adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the map collection is set to setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder to browse &amp; Amar@@ us ; to browse a folder to the collection , select the check box in addition to its name . this section also contains check@@ boxes for inser@@ ting , as with the selected folders .
browse the sub@@ folder : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; browse the crossed as well as their sub@@ folder to music .
monitoring Changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on modifications ( e.g. music files added or deleted ) , in addition , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary modifications to your collection .
play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ list browser .
the part collecting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you select between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another institution is necessary in the sub@@ window MySQL setup .
the MySQL setup is used for setting the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; under the machine : the MySQL database is entered by port : the network port is entered under the database . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to specify the data that needs to be connected to the database .
the cartridge card reli@@ .@@ f@@ m sets up the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can create the names of played pieces on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece .
here you can enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can record one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m web page .
then send pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters will be able to retri@@ eve the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ B ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshot photos .
Amar@@ o@@ ok only requires the k@@ del@@ ib@@ s package and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ del@@ ib@@ s so installed ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to get k@@ del@@ ib@@ s minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD is ahead , that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , i.e. , flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to use Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ del@@ ib@@ s and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files have an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library to days . you can view this file by clicking the Tag@@ li@@ b developer in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the broken file . after that , you can er@@ ase the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is that Tag@@ lib when reading the Meta @-@ Infos from this file system . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you &apos;re using MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ us is a bit more sophisticated .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ us libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to desc@@ ending when editing the Meta information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then disable autom@@ ation@@ . if in@@ active for ... into setting the sound system , or do not use any value of 1 second at least .
you can also send the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is due to write many program data as UTF @-@ 8 in the Meta @-@ 8 met@@ a @-@ information , but this is not a Unicode script that fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags from $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repeti@@ tion / Dynamic play@@ list ) are always careful - this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can easily remove the symbol effects on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you need to click on a icon , until this setting reaches its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app icon : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check whether Amar@@ o@@ ok are used to see whether Amar@@ o@@ can see the correct Q@@ t library . this allows you to see LD@@ D &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ h@@ ensive Q@@ t @-@ version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .conf so you will find the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are easi@@ est through the help of any experts your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or in developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under irc@@ .@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for assistance . please , there is only one error if you &apos;re looking for an error of any bug in Amar@@ o@@ o .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok it appears only an empty play@@ list . how do you get music pieces there ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag files into the right part of play@@ list .
to make the surface intuitive , the start window has been converted into statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation through the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , you have to display the evaluation list in the play@@ list and select column . Click anywhere in the new application column to specify the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if the Amar@@ o is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then click on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button to remove and then remove from play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with your mouse to the play@@ list and let it fall there , just like you would like to do it with other files . so simple this is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the add @-@ button , you can store the button play@@ list . Click on it .
probably you &apos;re missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; Amar@@ us package . re@@ install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; also look for lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the e@@ qualizer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it on the menu bar below Extras Equalizer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used one of the back@@ end independent approach , hence the actual question are supported G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty every conc@@ ei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG !
it may be ! perhaps you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 de@@ or are supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ less reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input paste
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ sa Driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mixer for the same time using audio mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem and a solution . for G@@ stre@@ amer you might need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
doing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must listen to AL@@ SA . G@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ coded the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can trigger directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ arity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure the art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s , that can cause distur@@ bing playback . read this error report . reading the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setting file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either use the Arts driver but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably , use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts @-@ buffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . depending on the buffer , the less orders react to visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to remedy him .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all components . register g@@ st register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can ask in the IR@@ C -@@ channel # g@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ o@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ph@@ m@@ peg download , comp@@ ile and install it as your normal user . delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you &apos;ll find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ amer @-@ config ) and run g@@ st register once again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please report about bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ COP , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and execute this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; Play sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll be kno@@ cked out of the gentle tones of music , which you stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ us ; running title , when one is in another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . here , interpre@@ t and titles of running pieces from : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ use name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your username and username . this requires that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows separated . press behind the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changeable window .
the combination of Ctrl + right mouse button provides a piece in the qu@@ eu@@ e sequence into the qu@@ eu@@ e . by pressing the input , the first search result is played and searching for the search .
OK , the player window and the play@@ list have tri@@ cky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
Click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser will be displayed .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ o@@ ok the collection database can not be created and the console appear many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either , you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ &apos;s MySQL support .
set the CD one , then click on audio CD and play a file browser with multiple folders . for normal view , change a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from folders mp3 or OGG .

basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with an abnormal value , based on how often the piece was played , the less impact on the overall score has been played .
you can click on the rating for a piece by clicking on a column @-@ in tran@@ script in the play@@ list window . then click on the evaluation of a piece in the play@@ list , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : review or F2 . you can change the evaluation in the met@@ adata dialog .

opens the dialog for formatt@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , creating content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between write modes and incre@@ ment .
burn a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which is then not supported immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously read DVD video can be converted to this dialog box . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but it also contains possibilities for changing video , encoding settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the specified medium . this information is shown in the content view and contain characteristics of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hat@@ ched .
converts the folder to the folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is checked , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also inserted a context menu with functions such as media @-@ info , locks and un@@ lock the device or throw out the media .
if the content view switches or from . the content view allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder map .
switch on the header line in the project view , or from the header line is a nar@@ rower area , which is only visible when the project view has open projects . the head@@ bar has no real function , it looks pretty nice and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window for changing the keyboard rules for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the key assignment here .
this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; wiring assistant . thus , the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs will be required . therefore , system administrators have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can customize general programming settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on request . this dialog is intended for person@@ alise and en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are important in the functional range , therefore , the type of your task is deci@@ de@@ able , which gives you access to the programmes .
in this chapter , we &apos;ll use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; you have to make sure you need to make sure &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programming , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ rights , inform@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) vo@@ id copy@@ righ@@ t@@ v@@ d ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ d@@ .d@@ d ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b _ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Through using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Quartet , Q@@ String parent ) vo@@ id Simp@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) vo@@ id re@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Quartet ) vo@@ id re@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) vo@@ id offset Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) vo@@ id offset Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String Quartet )
this makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ .@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / e@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reading for &amp; k@@ de ; with him you can easily be saved on audio CD ; s read and installed in MP3 or OGG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the encoder the installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ ress for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and of many co@@ di@@ ers ( comp@@ ress files ) are currently supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss @-@ free compression ) . more coefficients can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on your computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , convert these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats like the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading &amp; CD ; , by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia uses ; almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed . all these programs are usually not required for any Linux distri@@ butions , but if FLA@@ C is not used , if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ ter provides a small introduction to co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality , and comp@@ ressing factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia , for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid any copying protection ; even not the mechanisms of the copying protection could go . avoid simply the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while mounting only once must be done ( the setup dialog , however , it is often called up to a suitable configuration ) , afterwards the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) will be explained for the stream@@ lined approach of user interface , which you often can stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert it to many formats - depending which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; pick up the Free@@ DB file from the Internet or can be fully operated without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the master window . on the side @-@ step example , there are more information about how this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of the tab@@ s .
starting on request , the CD@@ DB will start the CD @-@ data according to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case first , the connection to the Internet must first be made . )
start reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the Field Operations tab for encoding settings .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder that can be read from any other encoder than the default . it is observed that previously the Encoder has been configured in setup settings in setup dialog .
opens the File manager , so that an already selected file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and encoded .
opens the setup dialog for the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , to set en@@ coders ) . you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes audio quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression rates and helps you choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats used by data compression , MP3 and OGG files are the most common . OGG may today have an easy advantage towards MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , however , the differences become less important because both co@@ di@@ ers generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , advertising is provided with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions
+ high to high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared with OGG easily deeper quality at lower bit rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG form@@ ers is available .
MP3 - when music is also heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable visibility for most people and most musical pieces acceptable visibility , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate for 5.5 . requires some older devices . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for music from adolescents , portable devices and car output devices . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want the absolute highest quality without consideration to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; Information that can be entered manually from Free@@ DB program automatically as a list of parameters . you can pass / used in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and the encoding program to create folders and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ ers , there are often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keyword ( english : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s can be encoded using lame and the title Parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; the result looks so out : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button number in assist@@ ants ) :
that &apos;s what the Free@@ DB is : a free database in which people can read / enter the audio CDs instead of which all the other information can be entered into the calculator below : &amp; CD ; titles , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , it is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent it from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither can artists have any damage to the music or CD ; any information can be obtained from a b@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; it is active in a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears to be used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address will not be used for retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer . )
there are many different countries copies from the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; for use of Free@@ DB , the geographical on the subsequent mirror server will be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and res@@ embles the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirrors for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually only monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what kind of reading is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; into WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , searching in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first if this is not yet done .
to store the compressed WAV files , the encoding and file format can be chosen . when opening , pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) can be added to the tab . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the co@@ di@@ ers package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are located in the chapter Wel@@ ker Co@@ unter .
after installing a co@@ di@@ ers , additional information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; lame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many reasons . check out the device &apos;s device , writing and reading , whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are trying to access both programs with a command line in one terminal .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , but all are understood somehow ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time and read all our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
you have to install c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , since it is considered non @-@ free software . anyway , it &apos;s not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to have ( eg ; to try to copy something with the Con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section covers basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; what is thought to presum@@ ably be done , and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what to be repe@@ ating &amp; CD ; must be repeated .
here we determine the re@@ usable co@@ di@@ ers for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we f@@ au@@ l we will share the program that use Free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings , we will probably not change at any reading &amp; CD , if the matching settings are found .
the device number will be handed over to the readable program that can read &amp; CD data / items .
often , / dev / c@@ drom exists a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive . if it does not work or if more than a &amp; CD / DVD drive can be accessed , so a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to perform existing records of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the cartridge card General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here , an additional conversion will be defined . in our example , everything will be exposed as shown in the screenshot that is shown in the screenshot .
only For in@@ complete information , so that you will be informed when information about the generating of keyword ( tags ) are missing .
the cartridge card CD ; -@@ Settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD can be downloaded automatically via the internet of a Free@@ DB calculator .
note : the machine must be connected during the reading &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Free@@ DB server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , you can easily change . the directory / file name is changed using box - &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you wish to enter manually , if you want to manually enter the database , if you want to use Free@@ DB in the offline mode , however , this is worth considering whether the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first selection fields will be set at least the following box card is set up .
CD@@ DB is available for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for data inquiry , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server to the Internet . how to get the system which should get the CD ? read the section on Free@@ DB , as shown in the screenshot of the screen .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your near@@ ness . on this way , the load will be distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as first attempt .
both do both work on the server , as many Fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , perhaps more luck with the 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data on the Free@@ DB server will enable you to disable the first check box .
simply take the settings from the screenshot of the screen . ( do they make sure the folder / tmp is running on your computer )
number of simultaneously connected pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one when using existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , so easy to try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check it around the &amp; CD ; cast off at the end of the trial .
custom folder for temporary files : if you cross this cross , then / must be stored in which WAV files can be stored in which the files are stored in a private folder where you don &apos;t forget to do this folder when you want to do something with WAV files .
to set everything as it is on the screen . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , something must be til@@ ted to the right .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned above , it is sufficient for very good audio @-@ quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . it &apos;s a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the creation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 . &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously co@@ di@@ zing WAV files : if a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section , as described above the process of reading &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . first , we will create MP3 files . first , we get a connection to the Internet since we get comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ DB , must be described in this section , must be repeated for any interpre@@ ting &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in Free@@ DB file , the screens therefore have a bit different from Free@@ DB file . therefore , you will learn how to retri@@ eve the &amp; CD ; data can be manually transferred to the Internet instead of using Free@@ DB . comments will be submitted to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen , this only if the &amp; CD has been identified as audio CD ; it could be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then check in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section regarding basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD could be picked up by Free@@ DB , all the tracks of the pieces are completed and the name of the artist and album will be displayed .
for the case that there &apos;s more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best suited to your &amp; CD ; fits in your opinion .
if you have not selected the check box for automatic Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for Settings ) , you can manually remove this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the titles of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen , the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Aktu@@ ell title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist doesn &apos;t need to be entered in the &quot; Update Field &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ les per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments on the CD &apos;s pieces .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of data from Free@@ DB , the CD Editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always contains the data as shown in the following image file ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limit the length of the fields to 30 characters for the commentary volume . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the encoding tab . take a look at the tab Settings section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . you will see in the help to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of the re@@ conn@@ aissance CD ; this is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD @-@ data . for more information , please go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example , can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors are back and you see that the fields are already filled with the submitted data , which we have recorded for the first piece . enter the items for the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and any other information you wish .
Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way up to all the cover data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the Free@@ DB file . it is already sorted into one of these categories .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the denom@@ inations .
note that there is a check @-@ in before every line of a piece . just the titles are selected . just a simple click on the line switches to select all the tracks are selected , or use the button all tracks to choose from the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection , read the read process , this window appears to confirm . on OK , then we will take a look at the window with orders and track what &apos;s going on .
Click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears if you &apos;re trying to work with a co@@ di@@ erer you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully co@@ coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example . did you test write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and en@@ code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration settings to read and en@@ code this behavior . the number of parallel processes can be read and encoded . for powerful tools , the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears no problem at simultaneous interpre@@ ting and en@@ code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while a different piece is coded , and a third order in the qu@@ eu@@ e &apos;s qu@@ eu@@ e stands . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ 5mm and 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the co@@ di@@ erer of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; it is now enter@@ tained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S , as part of the en@@ demic media package , however , you can already get a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is . if you read it , you &apos;ve probably already done it ...
this section is directed to persons who are compiled by source files and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of your distribution .
if you are looking for assistance such as the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it displays screens of different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , always read on ? even if only the Help menu has been cli@@ cked , without any attraction , like it is going to pass on this somehow empty screen ( above all if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t hold this hand@@ book . it &apos;s the first version for a manual of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; who , if you would like to add or modify this section , and if you should read this section and agree with this sugges@@ tion .
strange when you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; along with other real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time lighting of texts , other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it works on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ encing .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics in the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphic presentation of every MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go into &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window can be moved to K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( lyrics or tex@@ tures ) .
session support . if you finish &amp; dress ; during the playing of a song , K@@ mid kicked off again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File file . it appears the usual file dialog , which allows you to select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button finish in the tool@@ bar , select the entry menu from the menu item or re@@ use the space .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( in several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then play together . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive it with the kno@@ b .
if you find that a song is played quickly or slowly , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the speed display , then click the speed of speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ p LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the kno@@ bs is played like a print on the kno@@ ck or selecting the menu entry in the menu , then interrup@@ ts the playback . put the spac@@ eb@@ ar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in one piece of music . some pieces use text file , other use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can configure what events will be displayed and even better : the er@@ pillar @-@ type is automatically determined that you need to manually set up a song , so that you will automatically select the Karaoke text . they still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set a er@@ ec@@ cable type , select from the menu settings the entries or lyrics . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you will summar@@ ize . this section will be found in this section as you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . here you will find in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set up the desired requirements in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
during the application , this collection will not be saved . concerns the things when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it needs to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add the button to add a song . in turn , it appears to select the file dialog , using the help you want to select the song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection , a piece when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will automatically be added to the active collection .
if Automati@@ sch is not activated on the collection , when opening a piece the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click removing .
you can select the sequence where the songs will be played in the songs . if you played the songs from the menu &apos;s sub @-@ menu , the songs will be played in the sequence , as they added to the collection .
if you want to add or remove songs , or select random order in the menu , the order will be set .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list on the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu or push the button to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Pre@@ view button , the entry previous piece from the menu or press the arrow left .
to clear a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button del@@ eting .
temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter because they are not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that under@@ stands syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
for example , you can create a MIDI Map , which turns all events of the Type Change Patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type Change Patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus becoming a trumpet player , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ map because all sound@@ cards are GM compatible ( including AW@@ E - and G@@ US cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
there is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . you have to edit the appropriate file from Hand ( with your favorite directory ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that saves all necessary modifications for playing a piece .
each section may only appear , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . for this , however , any occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
fine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section will start ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches from General MIDI will be depic@@ ted on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like :
please note that the Left Side is igno@@ red . it is believed to change the GM patches in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds which allows you to put this instrument to the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a def@@ ensive drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can connect a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which means the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so , if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( def@@ ensive ) , patch is 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the concept drum Patch of Patch , a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) is , and not one , at which the clay means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify as sounds on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
like at PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to rep@@ licate tones on the par@@ ked @-@ channel . take a look at the following key@@ maps .
this section may be used to rep@@ licate some channels to others . if you want to connect the first and second channel , simply make this simple to CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following patterns :
n is the channel which is m@@ apped on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option to use the keyword &apos;s name for this channel . if you &apos;re using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the par@@ ked @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio can be multiplied , in which a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is used by the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then just forwarded . the value 40@@ 96 is not used in the map file ( no dec@@ im@@ bal@@ as ) .
this setting is used because GM is going to play a keyboard that will play a pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone above . unfortunately , some key@@ boards to play two tones up to an oc@@ tave . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you can click on Settings menu , point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole array of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cla@@ vi@@ ets you see which tones are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument at a particular channel . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to indicate the played tones . view in the Settings menu under the Point Channel : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you like to find a song to follow the text , you can make it down . to change the speed , use arrows to turn left and right of the LCD .
an MIDI file is a file that contains information on how a piece of music must be played like a piece of music . it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force any@@ body , &amp; k@@ mid ; with a good syn@@ thesizer you need a similar sound quality . in addition , you can change a similar sound quality . in addition to a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
that can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; so that &apos;s because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support is compiled . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s Home page )
I want to add a full folder to a collection , but I have no pleasure to add all files separately .
agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder where you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files from , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
enable you to add automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to temporary collection .
you can convert the arrow button on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double @-@ click the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; strike ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play an MIDI file ) or I &apos;m running a file , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window , change the file into the windows of &amp; k@@ mid ; pull them out .
if you want to listen a file only quickly , without adding it to a collection , turn the setting Automati@@ cally Add to Collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection of files
let &apos;s say you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. access to the first file only . so , select the setting Automati@@ cally Add to Collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then do you disc@@ ard to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I see these songs or I see the postcard , animated me , on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the third year I have written for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to program MIDI files , music and phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy to write me by e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really do a giant joy@@ ful when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . before you can send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me if I already have a MIDI file , since I have already received the file .
I did &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and doesn &apos;t want to get money . I would like to program because I can only program files ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - rec@@ tification of the bug that the pitch was high at AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also applies to the testing of the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for the testing of AW@@ E support , Has Pet@@ ter Bie@@ ker , Peter Gr@@ ass , Magnus Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , an error noti@@ fications , or just a supp@@ or@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians in the network that give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which can be found at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ mis@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can consult the development , find information on pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same thing if you use a FM device or AW@@ E @-@ card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . then , if you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems arise , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files containing M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer has been installed .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window will be formed from so @-@ called and@@ Baroque windows . there &apos;s always the window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only if information is returned therein .
it is possible to handle the preferred links below the bookmark book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , then you should use the category Dau@@ gh@@ ty play@@ list .
naturally , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you want an entry , his group and all its sub@@ sets will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and Dau@@ gh@@ ty play@@ list can also be changed by direct edit of the XML configuration files . obviously , the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player , but can also be changed by application itself . simply click on a name of a category . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content is displayed .
after changing XML files , select from the menu select the play@@ list and select either the user mode , or select another category .
all modifications are lost when the processor mode leave or leave another group without having the play@@ list .
due to the convenience of the author &apos;s &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation when starting and running can be de@@ activated by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate any other animation ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ ver@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / k@@ m@@ player / ec@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation when starting does not need to be short , it will automatically end to opening a different source . this would be distur@@ bing , the user may end up a second time at the end @-@ animation .
an easy example of a start@@ up animation can be a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; Hei@@ r ; &amp; lt ; Hei@@ r ; &amp; lt ; Hei@@ r ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ shell ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ shell ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ shell ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ shell ; &amp; lt ; / / ; / body@@ shell ; &amp; lt ; / / ; / scores ; / etc . / s ; are supported by a few examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here &apos;s the issue of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition within the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example how a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can even be played the special field check for YouTube in play@@ list XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can re@@ play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash can be specified in the setup dialog file of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be found in a console application and error messages concerning the load of the browser module library . if there is no errors , the back@@ end edition is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime @-@ type is taken ( of course only if this was determined ) , it must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all OGG files have to be recovered :
&amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; can be downloaded from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be properly configured , the scanner can be used in the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog box is found under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . you should be found out of which one has to be chosen ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably contains a DVB therein .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only work X@@ Video ( probably this kind of playing video devices using Linux the only works ) . this is also supported only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the video for@@ linux add @-@ on for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , the KM@@ Player for the sources are used for different names . at the time of the emer@@ gence of these documentation , this dv@@ d@@ n@@ av@@ source , automatic source , pi@@ pes@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ sc@@ anners , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , and v@@ ed@@ source . when it activ@@ ates , they start playing the play@@ list .
are there hin@@ ts on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive more quiet if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom exists as user root after mounting the device . it is absolutely secure that / dev / c@@ drom exists on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine is starting off only slowly , why has to be tested my CPU on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs to automatically check the last saved value , just the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

D e V ice I n@@ g@@ File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
one DVI ; file contains a description of the formatt@@ ed document and also other information like the font , and also other information such as the font is available from &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for various systems and equipment .
when using R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ waves , the elements of the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked on a element in the DVI ; file the exact opposite is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source text is cli@@ cked , the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is scanned .
Master document : this function is used with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified with other embedded .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in source code ) .
file watch : in this mode , the DVI ; file on Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ un@@ gen@@ â t@@ ing@@ â maintained - and it won &apos;t take a call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction .
in view of the edit tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ oves sel@@ ects should be developed into the document . the first selection box has been developed for quick review of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... Seri@@ aliz@@ able &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box further is to be included in articles such as tags , fu@@ cking notes or references . the ver@@ itable mos@@ aic are :
name : using this command a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection of selection ) .
when using quotation is displayed a selection list with literary entries . in &amp; bib@@ tex ; files are necessary editors necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bib@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; bib@@ tex ; files are natural also in &amp; k@@ ile ; files are written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ Ã e is used for defin@@ ing the font domain , which are set to the main text , the fu@@ cking notes etc . , there are the following fonts for the author :
when calling &amp; cr@@ ile ; two selection centres are available on the editor : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and fixed settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the cl@@ amps after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font domain . the font is not set at the beginning , this also may take place in the text .
once the ob@@ taining source code has been entered the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the easi@@ est way to this is the use of Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the button .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; ile ; the storage will be automatically created .
now , the comp@@ iling of the document should be sought after errors . when using quick construction should be created &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , this should not be started automatically . this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that will be treated differently than the rest document . the command \ \ &apos; begin { environment } , \ \ &apos; and \ \ end { environment } , \ \ &apos; and \ \ end { environment } would be possible to have the end of the font inside the region .
these changes are only allowed within the environment ( of \ \ &apos; begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no jus@@ ti@@ ty ( number ) for these changes within a environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , r@@ ust print , short pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either connected to the \ \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is designed for a short pressure , until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quotation in document . the quote begins with \ \ &apos; begin { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; marking language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide is now followed by a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once in assist@@ ants a bit of text was written , some adap@@ tations might be completed to better read@@ ability of the document . these should be a quote , a few places in fat and short pressure , and a po@@ em for application to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor via editor @-@ view or Ctrl E ( with internal viewer ) . the window must be closed with an external viewer .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can print or be converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and enjoy fun .
DVI ; is a world @-@ sized file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ º ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for reading the read@@ ability of some drivers from the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ k output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF transformer , or computer screen TVs .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are available as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) .
the tool@@ bar lighting the conversion of the DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source text has been created , the transformation into w@@ alled different formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preview search enables the direct jump from the Editor to the appropriate position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; cr@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setup for all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; binary files . for this purpose only Modern should be used under settings ...
in order to qualify for the pre@@ views , the mouse line must be positioned in one line of the source text , and connect to pre@@ views . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is done so .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it is possible with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; available in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor can be set as text editor ( Settings : Editor )
should no errors occur when using quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; a bug may occur . should an error occur , this is displayed in the log@@ ging file or in the news window .
the log@@ ging file is ob@@ struc@@ ted the error source in source code . in the editor you can always be used to appear on the error . in order to be cli@@ cked , the log@@ ged file must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging file and jump ; jump to incorrec@@ t line .
as soon as on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to choose from the set template for the document . the default features are :
for selecting a blank document , a document may be written either by reason or the assistant for quick preparation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be saved , stored and loaded to simplify the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; file can be created or created a new file . &amp; C@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection from file template ...
when creating a new document from a template using file , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in K@@ ile settings ... General Settings .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know what strings of which variables will be replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering in a document class . typically , it will be used as well : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { premature } .
the easi@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and there@@ with by means of the commands in the editor . once the document has been prepared for the following steps :
when creating a new document , then the own template may be selected rather than the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and searched it under described steps .
&amp; G@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers using many different types of text files ( including &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bib@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; cr@@ ile ; they will be made out .
to find out more about Kate and Kate ; and his mos@@ quito tra@@ des should be a hand@@ book to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found there with the Editor &amp; Kate &apos;s reading editor .
&amp; C@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command re@@ reference , which can be called for using the La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it includes almost all commands that can be found in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; using them as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with button@@ ed Ctrl key to gain the &amp; tex ; meaning that this way may be selected to select \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p \ \ par .
when pulling the text with a shortened left mouse button , the full text will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons with dr@@ illed conversion , parts of the source text in the Edit@@ or@@ window will be selected .
&amp; cr@@ ile ; for example , to browse and emphasi@@ ze the different types of source tex@@ tures . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can be included in the text . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . this jumping brand is highlighted the jump to the n@@ igh@@ th or last jump . this trampoline is also displayed automatically during the first input of a character .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; available in many environments and groups and therefore under@@ lining their selection . among editing are the following commands for the text @-@ selection :
for example , a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which are included on both sides ) . this extended meaning as well as all other text edit@@ orials ( as in other text edit@@ orials ) . this extended meaning as well as all other lines of the source text . this means that the only thing is divided into &amp; cr@@ ile ; it is therefore separated by two empty lines .
for example , the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an extended meaning , as this command also commands &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a stirring range ( \ \ ) and a foreign star ( * ) at the end .
for example , a part of a part of the document can be removed first of this first . &amp; Kate ; offers the key line Ctrl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands for a faster transmission . among editing are the following commands for placing the text :
removes the complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description of editing volumes .
it has been clear that environments can play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; so it offers &amp; cr@@ ile ; for more commands in working environment for a very simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . C@@ urs@@ or is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . C@@ urs@@ or is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ &apos; begin { environment } , the end of the environment is scanned ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering a lot of ac@@ tel@@ ed ambient conditions , this command can quickly be lost . this command slept in the last open environment , so that the covered environment structure is not broken .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X @-@ Gruppe are some important commands , which correspond to working environment .
with this command , at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . C@@ urs@@ or is placed directly in front of the soft cl@@ amps .
with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the p@@ ens .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the soft K@@ lam@@ mer of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering the bra@@ ces @-@ bra@@ cked groups @-@ brackets , the command can quickly be lost . this command slept the last weigh@@ ted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be broken .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple beginners can be used as G@@ Ã ¼ n@@ se@@ Ã ¼ s@@ schen . for this purpose , the sign is used for two simple adjustment characters . &amp; k@@ ile ; he knows this case and consist of two complete beg@@ inner characters for &amp; lat@@ ex ;
this automatic fold @-@ up of the double parts can be set up under settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and to be trained .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ oses or French ) , such as German or French sei@@ z@@ ations . there are also many other languages available .
at the centre of Shift ; Input @-@ aste &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line sl@@ ump . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , but not only a line sl@@ ump but also the command \ \ item .
close in a spre@@ adsheets and connect the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to emphasi@@ ze pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . this can be added to ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some user can arrange the columns in tables environments and create all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; seeking for ex@@ h@@ ensive Tab@@ ulator in the displayed row . although this tab@@ ulator is impossible to add &amp; cr@@ ile ; some inter@@ iors are added for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although Kate is already offering a good source code completion , this was added in &amp; cr@@ ile ; with special commands ( mostly for &amp; Lat@@ ex ; ) , three are working for different modes . all these modes are suitable for different working methods for different working methods .
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } is &amp; cr@@ ile ; automatically added to the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
by clicking the R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ button , the last letter of the input is removed and the default list . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are easily removed during selection of a command . alternatively , a simple jump to those positions by editing jumping marks N@@ Ã ¤ k@@ ste jumping brand is possible and the wanted parameters will be til@@ ted .
under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Ver@@ tical settings can be made to these lists . it can be arranged various wra@@ ps for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ Ã ¼ cher of the General Voice Command .
the command mode is not suitable for completion of environments . it is always typ@@ ed a few letters with \ \ \ begin and the call for a complete list with ambient temperature . otherwise , the environments become so often used , that &amp; cr@@ ile ; a special mode for completing the environments to disc@@ ol@@ ation .
when calling the installation mode Alt + Shift to do the menu , the command to open the environment will be automatically m@@ illed and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the ambient air will continue to sim@@ pl@@ est way and be completed by clicking the input button .
after this is complete , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; detects that there is a list environment , it will even be a first \ \ item command .
under settings c@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Ver@@ tical settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the default list of reference mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .

for example , the letter L is entered and the word written by default , or the short@@ age of registry , is initiated or the letter L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large wines are not helpful for automatic adjustment , however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter will be written in one document more than once . thus , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the processing of all already written must be written .
this mode can be set up in the default settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ ily Finish . here , the threshold value can be specified for viewing of the processing .
the processing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the image cap@@ tures y@@ ielding in graphics such as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for access@@ ing and re @-@ ordin@@ ations of pages . if the PDF output will be converted to a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are newly arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to increase the work of work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are to be compiled into Men@@ Ã ¼ s Create comp@@ iling , Cre@@ ating Change and Create View .
for viewing the source code for viewer as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 3 means by pressing Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and be used by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command quick construction , a viewer will normally be called after comp@@ iling . should no embedded viewer can be used , this will be a new window .
a new project will update the project &apos;s new project .... you will find the following information for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r repository .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the monitoring of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed to perform scripts in vertical bars .
the API scripts are still not end@@ owed , and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
the first must be said that the evaluation environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :

when it comes to a edition on the screen , its file is f@@ law@@ ed . please check the reported error and try it again .
if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then they let it simply drag the current file . if not , delete it with current file the check@@ box and select the file format using other file @-@ file selection .
if you want to know if the well @-@ kept file well , they click the well @-@ enabled review selection .
for using a &amp; D@@ TD ; file specified in the &amp; XML file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and XML ; schema available as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG verification , speci@@ fying the definitions @-@ UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
ja@@ ws , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library .
if the processing file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus should be selected . if not , then remove the current file , then select the selected file and select the file selection file using the other file selection file .
specify the name of the file as the result should be named , file is usually stored in your home directory .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found further below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , let &apos;s start with the menu plug@@ ins . thus the following dialog is open :
this dialog allows to manage and add all included plug@@ ins and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element therein :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to searching for plug@@ ins .
often working on a project several people work in a hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and those can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . N@@ ick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub@@ project manager .
the user can look out of the list of te@@ amm@@ ates which he is . this happens by pressing the Team Member from the list and ex@@ pressing the s@@ me@@ ar . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitude of your own identity are important regarding messages and notes . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of her team , there is another advantage through the acquisition of members of the team : it can be created an event about the team Manager , if something particular is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed if something particular should be done in the project , as much someone has worked , or the sending of a message if a file is secured , or a script that will introduce a file into CV@@ S as soon as they will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Setting Di@@ alog@@ es can create events , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see in the receiver list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see , knows this ladder .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note : simply enter the note message from the Editor @-@ Cont@@ ext menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a commentary area followed by a note text .
notes can be sent a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is , Role a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Manager Head of Sub@@ project Manager , the corresponding range or sub@@ project name , should be given in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and rollers @-@ names are independent of large or small letters , but spaces around the brackets and the note : make the comment invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and formatt@@ ing languages , the D@@ TD @-@ &apos; table and web @-@ based formatt@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be accessed using settings Quant@@ a ... called . Dies@@ er@@ dialogue extends for a few pages which are treated to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion , the entries can be changed :
large / Small sp@@ elling of tags : large / small sp@@ elling of automatically included tags . normal large / small sp@@ elling means tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag@@ onal XML files .
large / minor letters of attributes : large / small letters of automatically included attributes . normal large / small letters means that attributes are added to the day XML as they are described in the tag@@ onal XML files .
optional Tags automatically shut down : when attached , is inserted for tags , for which closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
no optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags , except for easy tags .
start and end day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during ti@@ pping .
M@@ IME types : m@@ im@@ etric types for detection of different types of files . using the Standard button , the default cores can be recovered .
standard encoding : encoding of newly created or in other ways than with file open @-@ open files ( where encoding the file may be revers@@ ed ) . however , this setting is clari@@ fied by the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is out of the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that a power failure or crash during next start of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . also for not stored documents , a backup is regularly generated , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be shown either in the editors or an own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ ography ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings back next to the next start is useful if the user interface has come through modi@@ fying the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages range serves to the tax of the possibility to in@@ quire the display of war@@ nings of no more .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can display the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . see the different modes , see .
here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which depic@@ ts the mapping of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document .
in the mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action is possible to modify the structural tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in tree , which will be opened automatically during a change of structural tree , empty no@@ des are set automatically . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are no element found in the current document .
the area for fixing of abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) which can be un@@ folded for more extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s . this means it may be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ to@@ g has something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are used by third page , which can be used by any part @-@ capable application , in the most well @-@ known &amp; conc@@ quer@@ or ; in the inser@@ tion of a plug@@ ins must be specified :
address : the path to plug@@ in , if it is not on a standard location as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is transferred to the plug @-@ in to the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of current file ) or the repository .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to load the load when this option is not chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check @-@ in : is this enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , if the plug @-@ in is not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the error messages was completely re@@ designed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bug@@ ging , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Debug@@ ger , which enables various implem@@ entations about plug@@ ins .
currently , only a plug @-@ in is available , support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adding .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with selecting a suitable de@@ bug@@ ging plug@@ ins in the project settings . using the button options next to the Debug@@ ger @-@ plug @-@ box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated , some additional elements appear in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view in which the content of the monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view , in which all brackets are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears at the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the monitor ( as shown in HTML ) of the Debug@@ ger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bug@@ ging , if necessary , or she shares the plug @-@ in with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ t demands . this action is opened by default , which must not be de@@ bug@@ ging , so that a de@@ bug@@ ging must not be considered .
the counter@@ piece for de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bug@@ ging or termin@@ ate the har@@ p according to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to server access@@ ing a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the Debug@@ ger &apos;s view .
has the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and current information on the monitored variables . if this is done , the execution occurs when the script is started , the script will start with the requirement .
shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script without notice . if this happens , while a script is done , the execution proceeds but before a de@@ duction requirement has been given , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is provided .
the Debug@@ ger will lead the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or includes .
the Debug@@ ger will guide the next command in the script , where possible in functions and includes an error @-@ adjusted .
does the de@@ bu@@ gger allow the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over and go to the next , than there would not be the current .
opens a dialog box in which a variable or expression can be entered , which shall be monitored . the revised value appears in the variable side .
this dialog can be entered into a variable , or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to customize your needs and help you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help you get better .
edit type editing packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . you enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for your simplicity and flexibility made of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user friendly &amp; IDE ; for WEB@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ KLE@@ R , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . day files are handy , symbo@@ li@@ ly oriented bodies of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , text and instructions faster in a document when a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be prepared perio@@ dic@@ ally ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see details for transformation .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; &apos; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; itself . tool@@ bars also contains a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any danger of writing .
tag folder are not available as folders . they contain only the &amp; &apos; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder apply the name of the write @-@ language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use other users a better look and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is shown in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur in one document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but otherwise nothing else can be found itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; one argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the type class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( Family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; Day . that &apos;s an element of element element .
describing the attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . additionally , it contains no further Tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed , etc ; This is a only element type element .
gives the source of the source codes for the attributes in the tag editing dialog , and the attribute @-@ tree attribute .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology is used within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and methodology name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % day name % , this means the name of the latest tags .
a container tag that is group@@ ed together into the elements of a list . it can only occur within one attribute of the attribute . it is a element @-@ type element .
puts the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog . this day can occur only once in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in a dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
gives a list of elements that occur within the defined tags . this element is a only one element .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only one element .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ased and closed .
spaces influence nothing but attention to &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; ; particularly in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ type &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools Dialog at the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; windows start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . a further dialogue will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , check only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
in the following example , for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; Element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the File Name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; &apos; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is very simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD edit D@@ TD . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = use = 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for every higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as N@@ ick@@ name .
a action can set up action with settings ... to be created . Click on New Action for the same dialog :
the button assigned to this action . with clicking the button user can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with caff@@ eine is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be inserted a text in the det@@ ai@@ ding settings and in execution of the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will use or input ( or parts of the document ) , the quick start @-@ up dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ EPs .
first the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % script@@ st variable in command line , like sh % script@@ .exe / scripts / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in its path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file is removed / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script is used .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the repository .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , there can be a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the selection box input can be determined which can be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected part of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
according to input , the output of the issu@@ ing application can be re@@ directed . there are two types issue : normal output , to the default output , which may be done by default , which is set to the standard edition by selecting the drop @-@ out issue :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
as soon as a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure it . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts to edit the Edit mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar .
complete all and , if the day attributes and you plan their use , activate dialog &quot; Open Day , &quot; if available , thus one input when using the promotion is possible .
ign@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let us know before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the promotion is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic more programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size other .
please note that this will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a kno@@ b button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered as less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least specify this symbol no &amp; lt ; ready to insert a message ; -@@ day in current document .
after the creation of the symbol , it must be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
if you select the folder where the stored symbol is set , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
assum@@ ing , you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be shared this to better overview by some Tren@@ ner to several groups . open the tool@@ bar to adjust dialog for tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the cutting tool ( at the top left ) for my tool . after selecting the element to add to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
I &apos;d like to add a quick way to access the quer@@ quer@@ or preview . I will choose it and add to the tool bar .
please note as the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone , who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; kno@@ b the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ b@@ ating all symbols to ensure that everything works .
backup in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , but your tool bar should be stored in the right folder , but watch their tool@@ bar ( s ) if your tool bar will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the respective type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users , add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the formatt@@ ing language you like this chapter , how I describe a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create a existing documentation for the formatt@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to rev@@ ise the doc@@ r@@ c file . we need to give you the first part we will handle here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # 2 , tag@@ 1 , day 2 , day 3 , day 3 , tag@@ 3 , day 1 = Inter@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Inter@@ 1.@@ html day 1 = tag@@ s.@@ html day 2 = tag@@ s.@@ html day 3 = day 2,@@ html day 3 = day 3.@@ html
section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of contents , # Getting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference = Basic Reference = Basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ synchron@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows the sub@@ folder to be found in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the sh@@ aking depth ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you note that the directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but attention to &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources can be replaced .
the summar@@ ies is the range of doc@@ r@@ c file that is used for creating the context sensitive help . by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl ; H for context @-@ Help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the Cont@@ ext List ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of isolated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file doc@@ r@@ c to the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc for local and global use . then create a folder like doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these well and worth are to be divided , send your doc@@ r@@ c files to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ator resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else . at different places there is an email with email , like D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , in context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main Archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download it and use only available when our team is used as a correct and easy @-@ to @-@ use contribution to what it guarantees a g@@ p@@ g / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their personal g@@ p@@ g key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you need several keys , you can continue reading multiple keys ( URL pre@@ ferences can remain empty ) , and click OK .
upload the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , upload tool tool@@ bar , and folder in context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource through examination of the integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems , it may be broken . if the integrity is given and the resource has been signed , a message appears with the specification of the Creator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , it is possible to work by a D@@ T@@ EP package . the preparation can be needed time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files can be needed automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD Load and Conver@@ ting of a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with D@@ TD @-@ Beschreibung , which is to be used , then the following dialog appears :
objective name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quantum / d@@ art@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TYPE Defin@@ i@@ der@@ line : the string that is in ! DO@@ C@@ TYPE Day , like HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / Off e@@ .d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine @-@ adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; following transformation The newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; adapted to the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are several key concepts . to understand these basic concepts , you must first make this fundamental concepts . this chapter refers to them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit is meant .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and projection @-@ related . this distinction concerns a series of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored in common folder &apos;s structure , actions and patterns in the global tree to ensure that each in a multi @-@ user environment is available .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that it can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special promotions specially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder &apos;s folder , what is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the function blocks , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bar . please suggest in , and for further information on these areas .
in order to click to select a context menu with the right mouse button , to get a context menu with the current document entries , re@@ charging , delete or upload the document , jump to an book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editors , lead to another context menu , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the word under the mouse po@@ inting or open the file when using the string under the mouse po@@ inting file .
at the top end of the editor , the tool@@ bar will be shown . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want one day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in their document , then click on the symbol that provides the day . now they may add one day that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can insert several fields in a dialog .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , they can open and per@@ ver@@ t . in the representation with cardboard boxes are available for files , project , pattern templates , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool which provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it displays all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project using right mouse click . actions as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or delete files from the storage medium can be done using the context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , all web site &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category hangs by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates are available .
here you can find information about the insert in Global , Local and Project . by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information to a script . via the right mouse button you can start to edit or send the script using the right button .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links to a element of element , the cur@@ sor is set on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking a element opens a list of commands to navigation and check @-@ up of the tree .
this tree appears under the other architectural views . with it , man@@ rapidly Attri@@ butes and nam@@ esp@@ aces will change the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is a complete documentation for web @-@ technology for your development . you can create your documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site can be created , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ aries on the lower end of the window can be achieved using the beneficial information : the news window and the problem windows .
this cardboard box shows information on any qu@@ ant@@ um @-@ running script . for example , the D@@ TD uses the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this cardboard box shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , specify all error messages ( so that there is ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the ch@@ ocol@@ ates is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
a further function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; when you get a tool@@ bar in an email ; it can secure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as any other guarantee and charge !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files to your system wish . in order to receive a complete list of options , enter the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not implemented here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path has the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H is in front of their bin folders . it is the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a well @-@ engine@@ ered development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a close @-@ up idea ; now , this would make him an absolutely amazing web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now it is enclosed on the way to a general and comprehensive Web Development Tool@@ box : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above @-@ mentioned requirement has to be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product to the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is not only everything possible ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ odo@@ urs is not only everything possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as soon as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows Web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this may extend the productivity of almost every task . by the program compression , they can remember &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; without any kind of scrip@@ ting language . ( more on them find them in . )
&amp; Quantum a ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Quantum a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Quantum a ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Quantum a ( either the URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or help you help : / qu@@ ant@@ a ) .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list is changing any time , if you can open a file , which will not be taken out , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and complete files as templates for later use . check out the section above templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside of the local / project assignment .
convert the special characters to &amp; HTML , from the clip@@ board , so they appear correctly and cannot be understood correctly by the browser as formatt@@ ing .
convert the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL , which is the correct way to inser@@ tion of special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ tion &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
switch the blocking selection or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are displayed !
sear@@ ches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ ging .
turn and switch on the problem of the problem at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the master window is activated once you switches to the structure tree .
shows the symbol links from the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if it marks the book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries or next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents will be group@@ ed in the menu according to the file names of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presenting a dialog for inser@@ tion files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory according to new files , which allows you to copy graphics files into your project folders or to add a sub @-@ folder to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . list of available shipping methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects please refer to the details .
downloads a project tool@@ bars . these are kept in the field of you / tool@@ bars and are only listed in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bars : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that &apos;s only the name . actions you need to specify address actions ... added to tool@@ bar , or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of visual field . if you don &apos;t have this hard drive from hard drive . if you don &apos;t have the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do it .
thus , you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) team that opens the tool@@ bar in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endix .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where any other can access it . see .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or anything else has made and convert into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own custom format .
shop / ref@@ resh of En@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ EP ; it is useful if the En@@ ti@@ ties are from &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; to ren@@ ew the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; to ren@@ ew this global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , fail to store the load .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is available , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool .
allows to access the current tag dialog when there is one . this entry is always available , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; specific sub@@ men@@ tions .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent In@@ sert means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus may refuse to contra@@ dict the tool if this day contra@@ dict the rules .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins in the above menu are listed below . clicking on a activated plug@@ ins de@@ activated .
select the syntax mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line identification . very useful if you know the other OS platforms to create . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application of Ti@@ dy .
immediate shut@@ down between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over mode , which is also the default settings , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu for each open window contains a entry . with a selection of an application the corresponding window will be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window or .
the changes in this dialog allows any application to use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browsers .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate , you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete records from the tool@@ bar or add which lines may follow .
this should create a help correspon@@ d@@ ingly to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free when using every Open Source Project , developers can always use aid . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial support you find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically completed .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with an extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository directory .
here you can access the machine address of the machine , which you want to access local dates . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if one is empty by this field , the default settings of the selected protocol can be used . depending on the remote computer , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files for different projects should be used instead of the standards .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
this allows to add files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . by default scripts ( eg . &amp; PHP ; Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
to be stopped , if files are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project started on newly started , no h@@ anger .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the folder &apos;s folder and you can make accurate selection according to credits .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by anch@@ ors or through removing the check , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be modified in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the lower window profiles , or with the keyboard short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which can be igno@@ red during project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
supplementary option to above , including files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project . in addition , more about project prospects can be read .
thus the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be set in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in can be configured with the Options button . in addition , the de@@ bug@@ ging is described .
in the lower window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a tree view for every profile , by po@@ inter a specific tree view for each profile .
in the lower window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the next window event configuration , you can change event actions and add these actions to change or delete . event actions are executed if a previously specified event will occur , such as the sigh@@ ting of a file . see details .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project , which was opened . this behaviour is currently not able to influence .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the Project Project or the Symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project will be displayed and allows choosing a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it will be automatically saved , if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files , if you load a new project .
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
folder be@@ have as well , however , the entries will open and open the context menu with the right mouse button :
here you can find various profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows the removing of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button will exp@@ end to prevent removing .
the password is kept in the core memory and forget to forget . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk image does not occur in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialogue if you modify your opinion from up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; multiple high @-@ loading profiles can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialogue is displayed :
that &apos;s the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a qualified domain name or an IP address work .
the transfer protocol for loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ io Sl@@ aves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operates a service on the usual port .
depending on your Ang@@ st@@ schw@@ elle , this is either a tim@@ ed function or a danger . use it to your discretion . the password will be saved on the plate , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can be seen easily in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in one project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the Project Project or the Project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this does not only help productivity , but also allows adjusting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to make your own work .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best above the menu tool@@ bars . use and add @-@ adding . Adding tool@@ bars will be treated below in the section adding of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bar and symbols can be adjusted either by means of context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , creating new tool@@ bar , creating tool bar , or tool tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog , where campaigns should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu on a tool@@ bar ( icon ) on a tool tool@@ bar , the entries can be removed and action worked , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool bar ... and set settings ..
templates are basically important document sk@@ el@@ ets , code cut@@ lets and files for link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , shift , or any on the system existing in the pre @-@ level file . templates in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions they submit to the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of any template .
binary is everything that is not pure text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary , binary files are normally inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples are listed under global templates . further information on the templates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text file type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate ways to efficiently be efficient . some examples may be found in advance @-@ tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not included a new document based on a template , but the same text area should always be included in the documents . you can find out a comment via a final menu system to Javascript or Perl basis . see for more information about the templates tree .
as the name suggests , they are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents , which can be arranged in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure according to your choice ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template , save local template ....
as soon as this has happened , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the repository . look under project templates .
select text in your document and store on File As a template can store as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drawn easily with pulling and placing on the tree view .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file just into a template folder , so you can use all file management features , such as pulling and insert or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a folder on the right and select a folder icon in the file tree or on a folder and secure a name for the template , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates enable a very well @-@ oriented approach . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , add files or associated with them . additionally , some things can easily be associated with using templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the template &apos;s structure in the sub@@ windows templates is based on the files contained in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / apps / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / templates / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates . each of these folders matches one of four types of containers , as described above .
to specify the folder &apos;s behavior in the table of mouse button , click on the folder and select the following dialog :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is canc@@ eled , as soon as el@@ ter@@ istic attributes is out@@ law@@ ed .
this is enabled by default and fit for everything except for family folders . if a regular folder would de@@ activate it , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would be found something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably be found in a family folder .
allows the set or subsequent text for templates in this folder . this could be general head lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and enabled a folder with special head lines / foot@@ lines a complete presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
additionally , you can press context menu ( click on the right button of mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or insert templates from a place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode replaced the source text editor from the V@@ PL ; editor and the second shares the editor window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it does a document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and edit the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; Editor is visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor to a document , which contains the PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; file editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to modify this conduct .
the second mode does not work exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ously , this mode has enabled the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings qu@@ ant@@ um .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can automatically choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . if necessary , the recommendation is automatically set for fast computers and a large range for slow motion .
assum@@ ing that , one wants to change the title of this website , so the processing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; Editor is created . this is the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags gives the storage of information about the document themselves e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing two buttons below or by clicking on the contents , e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key password to the contents -@@ column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in a browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules using buttons below the list or delete . a change on the list is possible exactly as with the Meta @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to incorpor@@ ate an external CSS styl@@ ing system by pressing the file open button and select the appropriate file .
the use of cur@@ sor is like in a text processing , possible by paths with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the marking works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing , using button or dist@@ aste .
the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in source text editor , which is done before the inser@@ tion of tags , previously existing tags , enclosed with text , must be removed with text , every other surrounding anchor must be removed .
some tool@@ bars like the tables @-@ wiz@@ ard or the lists @-@ wiz@@ ard are disabled . later , they will work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , tables or lists tool@@ bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of breast@@ feeding systems . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ feeding systems , search for certain elements is possible and the execution of style can be prosec@@ uted .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need to be comp@@ ile , besides &amp; k@@ de ; there are libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ per@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

there are many graphic tools for the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me tell me what I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and simultaneously corrected the ind@@ entation . another programmer had changed much text in the same file much text . the result was numerous conflicts in collapse .
the program used by me only showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indications on the places where maybe only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of this changes was a small night@@ mare .
thus , this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , any of further useful functions were added .
if you want to compare text quickly , copy it easily into the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative window .
a function which made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging will be fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of co@@ ats , and displays the original file sharing . in this Editor , you can even edit the result . in this Editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screenshot shows three Qu@@ ell files in merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you make the same folder with the same and merge folder . this image shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and visu@@ alize the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed vis@@ ib@@ ly . if rows only differ in certain number of white signs , you can see at a glance at the Sum@@ mary in the column on the left . ( no stum@@ bling if any change is changing . )
if one file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then shows the color to which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily write the typ@@ ing work by writing only the file names of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder per@@ ch@@ 1 folder per@@ ch@@ 2 folder , diff@@ 3 folder per@@ ch@@ 1 folder per@@ ch@@ 2 folder per@@ ch@@ 2 folder per@@ n@@ 2 folder folder
opening dialog allows the manual page of fil@@ en@@ ames , select your selection through the file browser ( file ... ) or select a third file . you need to specify a third file , if you have to leave the file for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be carried out .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge folder will be selected , for B and C , however , using &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file names from A in the two other folders .
if they are crossed , the input field is active for target and it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file , however , you can run this step later while saving .
the set button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare an entire file , but only parts of a text . &amp; diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board . in comparison , you have to select any files , you can simply connect the dialog with the break button .
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes contains a file , e.g. several similar functions . if you want to figure out how much larger effort . you would need to create and compare two relevant files , you can easily copy and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only pull out the case from text into a comparative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the drag and drop text into another program as cut and inser@@ tion ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the Info @-@ line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that the mouse is optional ) . ( if the path turns into a file , you will leave the mouse over the line . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . )
the three sources are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , the color is different . if both files differ is the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
links next to the text is the summar@@ ization column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters is not so important , only the relevant changes are visible . ( with C / C + + , e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and reviews , for Pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line , which separates the column column of text , is interrupted at the locations where the respective source file has no lines . when the line sl@@ ump is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the result list ( below the comparison stern ) also has an info @-@ line with the inscription Edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; feelings &#93; when you have the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! up to all conflicts are dissolved , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next dissolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , each difference is also to be replaced either by means of a conflict .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group is displayed in all windows . ( this will also be displayed on the first line of the group , where the beginning of the group is not visible . ) This group is highlighted the current group . it becomes clear with the color background color to the left and on the left shows a black beam .
sometimes , by automatic merge or by manual editing , no further line left in the group . this text is displayed because you may change your opinion , and perhaps again another source . this text is not copying or later in a mark that you might want to copy and what else could .
the text &amp; lt ; distribution conflict is , however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy these text from the query pane . c@@ auti@@ ously with this function .
note : when selecting the sources can ign@@ ore options or ign@@ ore Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in figures or comments are treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the image run and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard , right , up @-@ down , side down , side down , end , Ctrl @-@ Start and Ctrl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use other programs here . the super@@ vis@@ or column in addition to the vertical image @-@ bar can also be used by clicking on the navig@@ ating button .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the inser@@ tion button you can switch between plug @-@ in and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies columns synchronize the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section merge and the editing window was explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation using the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctrl @-@ Down / Ctrl @-@ Figure down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Ctrl @-@ Move Down / Ctrl @-@ Figure down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict , continue to solve the conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ solved conflicts have to be distinguished .
to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you &apos;ll need to copy the copy button ( Ctrl @-@ C or Ctrl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is checked , automatically copy the copy automatically . be careful when you write to the clip@@ board , because you could accid@@ entally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . UNIX variants use a line @-@ in @-@ feed string \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car output + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ ce@@ de \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 does not re@@ tains the source file source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files .
the options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and restored when starting the next start . ( setting up menu &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a script with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides scriptures with variable width to choose , but you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ sive script will not be displayed . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , several colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically creates an un@@ loaded color .
when this option is activated , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator button inserted a tab@@ ulator character .
when pressing the input or return , the incoming line is automatically used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection will automatically copy into the clip@@ board . manually copy the manual into the clip@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is commonly used based on the operating system .
when comparing files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical rows can be found in the source files . the second step is to ign@@ ore white characters . this step will not ign@@ ore white characters . this step will not ign@@ ore white characters . this step will not ign@@ ore white characters .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car back character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line slot &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then they can only store files with different sizes in side @-@ on @-@ side comparison , but they may be de@@ activated using different sizes in side @-@ side comparison , but this option must be de@@ activated . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in the default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of analysis we will ign@@ ore numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; . &apos; . in the result , the differences are displayed , but they will be treated like white characters .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive to even smaller differences look . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow to very large files .
in automatic ski@@ p mode , this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next ung@@ od@@ est conflict is passed .
sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is a manual selection ) . if you only need any number of files in many files , then use the Automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ign@@ ore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments .
these options are handled in chapter to scan folders and perform a merge . check for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and an older version exists , then the original version is added to the Suff@@ ix .@@ original file already , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and rest@@ art that the change is active in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set global via the control centre . )
the following encoding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry , if this option is activated , the upper setting is used for all entries .
on the selection fields for the coding , a short notice appears that the local encoding is . ( this can not be changed here and has purely inform@@ al character . )
customize the file coding for source files . this is how special characters can be treated and interpre@@ t . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and combined .
if you have processed an file , you can specify which coding are to be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you could possibly not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be encoded with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing operations .
turn it off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in text or belie@@ fs . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ign@@ ore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences may be seen in a color@@ fully coded over@@ load column . but sometimes you might see only the differences between two of three files . according to the selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C and B &amp; lt ; -@@ C , next to the normal still a second over@@ load column with the required information is displayed .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply click the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
select the comparison window by side or each other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the Window Menu . )
sometimes , you consider the differences and decide to merge files . if you only compare two files . a simple click launches the file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge command , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first be delivered to this external command . in &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which allows you to cut @-@ out parts or correct settings .
when reading a file it will first be delivered to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command command is used ( see above ) , then you can write your own pre @-@ processing command , which transl@@ ates exactly your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to enable more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , any user would like to program an external program , and most users would like to program the good news , however , that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this command line command to convert the input in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ U in the first mon@@ ary string . \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . * \ \ &apos; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you want to experiment with SE@@ D , you might start to understand and perhaps you may like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ance of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line balance . SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character is just replaced by anything , so you would be deleted by anything .
sometimes you might want to perform several consider@@ ations at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to use the objectives of each other . example :
instead of SE@@ D , you can use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; , however some details are different . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) are needed , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
data after normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and merge . other operations only change the data collected by the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the line @-@ type pre@@ processor is the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but like any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often programmers need to edit many files in one folder . this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ cur@@ sive .
... making any object a sugges@@ tion to assem@@ ble ; you can adjust the proposal before start ,
... can the merge and sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes without having to perform them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of single files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in a dialog .
if three folders are merged , Fol@@ der 1 will be used as the basis . if no target folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts to run . in order to run the merge , you must press the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow )
while reading the folder informs you a small news panel about the current progress . if you break down the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
if the scan of the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with results on the left , ...
each file and folder of all folders found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold up a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or on the object double @-@ click . the directory menu contains two functions all sub @-@ directories and fold all the sub@@ directories with which you can fold or down all folders .
if you click on a file , the file will be started off and it appears as a comparative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation can not be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started automatically , you will be informed about the problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , columns are used in the columns A / B / C color red , green , yellow and black .
however , in identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries are different .
folder are regarded as identical when all of its content is identical . then the same folder also have the same color . with folders , the age is invisible for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow turns and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such incorrec@@ t objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such incorrec@@ t objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ising is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders have been synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : merge and save the result into both folders . ( the user looks as the visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and calcul@@ ates the newer file to copy . if the files are identical , but the date is identical , but that error message can not be eliminated , the merge folder will not be started .
while the merge becomes a file after the other . the status column shows how the merge has been successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages , if something unexpected occurs , you should review last review , and see if the status is in order everywhere .
when used for installation dialog , the file @-@ comparative Analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or combined . )
you can assem@@ ble either the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all co @-@ hr promotions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) you can run the merge .
note : if you don &apos;t have any target folder , then in the three @-@ file merge mode C , B is selected as a target and used for synchron@@ ising A and / or B as a target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the folder file , you can also check some options by certain entries . check those options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to comp@@ ose all entries : select directory entry / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . in order to run only the current entry : select Aktion in the current element or press F@@ 6 .
when contra@@ dic@@ tory file types still exist invalid , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid promotion .
if you run all entries , a dialog window with options pass through , sim@@ ulating and break .
select Sim@@ ulating if you would like to see what would happen without which really changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then has certain actions with all entries with all entries . if a manual enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ment is necessary ( summar@@ ize a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screenshot ) .
if you &apos;re ready to start with a file , select another directory entry / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you don &apos;t have yet saved , an appropriate dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the conclusion of the list , you &apos;ll notice some error messages which will help you to dis@@ solve the problem of the problem or dis@@ solve the problem to solve any other action before going on with the merge .
if some entries were individually combined , see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and does not result together . even if this compilation was transferred or not saved , these entries will be considered as done . only if you modify the merge action , these entries will be combined once again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called Register of Properties with these options :
only files that will fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . they can be entered several patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default directory do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than a pattern set , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than a pattern set , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ res files that are also igno@@ red by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically produced files are igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set using a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( check out at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hi@@ de@@ file attribute . in other file systems , a leading point is selected . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element @-@ tree or not . this option is switched on in the default .
links to files : if the option is switched , symbolic links are compared , if the option is switched on , the files are compared to indicate the links . this is de@@ activated in the default .
links to the folder : if the option is switched on , the links are switched on . if the option is switched on , the links are handled and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a link to a folder that lead to itself and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is switched off in the default .
complete analysis every file through and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably s@@ lower if it is applied to files which contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folders through a s@@ lower network , it may be faster , only the change date and file size would be higher . please use caution . this option is required in default .
similar to the changing date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered equal , if they are equal , this may be useful if the copying date is lost . please use caution . this option is dis@@ rup@@ ted in the default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode if two folders are compared and no target directory . in this mode , the suggestions for merge files are identical , too , the results are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in both folders .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ sure , because the other file has not been changed . ) This option is switched on in default .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted by other files , the original version will be replaced , then the normal merge file with the .@@ original extension already exists , this will not only be able to merge operation . this option is switched on in the default .
normally , the folder s@@ wap file remains visible in bringing together single files ; you can switch the window parts with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window or text windows to switch the main window in the Window Menu and switch between the two screens between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare one file simply by double @-@ click . if you want to run a single file , you can run the current file merge with the merge menu . once you have the result , the status will be done automatically and the file will not run once again when you run the folder .
this status is lost , however , if you read the directory again : new menu : read :
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . some things should be considered :
a path can be relatively and .. .. that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty sheet &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . a brief list of limitations :
or it can not be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , FTP : ) .
there is no way to process per@@ missions or change accounts from the original . ( please note this option to commit the size . ) ( this is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ elop . K@@ Dev@@ elop always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . in order to start with K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the Differ@@ ences and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as K@@ Part , the input file carries a patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then install &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a Patch @-@ file and select from the context menu . please note that this doesn &apos;t work when the original files exists since the production of the patch file has changed .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is done , it supports only the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the compar@@ isons is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it is Kom@@ pare ) already . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can result in combination with the diff@@ 3 program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use the GPL @-@ programs already very long and have learned a lot by taking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers that go through this way or go to him .
you have thought the program compiled and the configure script will probably be notified to K@@ DE . in default , configure the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical as identical ; if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . , similar to E@@ ACH other , this is co@@ g@@ but this is O@@ FT@@ EN the case .
the Editor noted for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this important information is lost , however , if the result is simply stored as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to design an own file format which could store this information .
the effort was so far too large . you can recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit greater amounts of text , another editor should be applied .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no src soo@@ thes ; published and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does it mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to emphasi@@ ze differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
for information how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile and install &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives you the folder to your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are un@@ sure , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
because &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto @-@ conf and autom@@ ake should you have any problems with comp@@ ile . however , they should appear difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists thereof .
cut out ( Ctrl @-@ X or conversion @-@ removing ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( Ctrl @-@ V or conversion @-@ inser@@ tion ) adding the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current selection .
only differences show : files that are identical in all folders are not published in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you must read and read the folder to these options . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are showing that identical files are not already copied to the target folders . if the destination folders are not already copied , they are missing after the merge . ( behaviour is likely to be modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group . if the lines are already existing , they will be removed when clicking on the button accordingly .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ shoot in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ show of all virtual working areas . it &apos;s quite convenient to change the running programs on the work@@ space to change their size or move it . this works both within a desktop and in several ways .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual working areas as well as those in running applications . applications can be selected and even on the desktop and to others .
with the central mouse button you can move windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in either desktop and on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends , where the right mouse button is click on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has been cli@@ cked within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu and the name of the application , as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , Tow@@ ards and commands .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . it appears only if an application was cli@@ cked .
send the application to selected virtual desktop . it appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the Desktop and also on other work@@ places .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the name of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
crossing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . it is crossed together with name , you will have the names with folder , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only empty work@@ spaces will be displayed to allow their selection .
here is the view of the program window . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the program window . symbol displays the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a little view of the real program window . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; main window will be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , all virtual working areas in a horizontal row indicates what is very good for displaying side at the desktop on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager miniature program in the control bar . it also has the advantage that it can display and move window as symbols or with their content . it also runs outside the control bar .
clicking the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent select switch @-@ switch ... lets the dialog be released .
currently it cannot be changed in the dialog for Settings : but you can manually do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you have no write permission to enter your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and as@@ sign the value to this file . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is required , you need a functioning installation of K@@ DE base packages .

if you like &amp; k@@ mag ; it appears window as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following this window is indicated as magni@@ fication window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as selection window .
in the standard setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inters like a mo@@ ve@@ able micro@@ scope . alternatively , you can add &amp; k@@ like ; to set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse po@@ inting at the screen ( eg ; on the left of the screen ) .
do you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inters in enlarged window , select the right mouse button . please note that it is not able to reco@@ gn@@ ise the mouse button . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Maus@@ er .
in the box mode you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with arrows and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse button in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can get the content of the magni@@ fication window and move it with arrows .
if you add additional Shift &amp; Shift ; push button or M@@ MB ; use the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains and just move the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ like ; has a lot of functions . you can send the larger image directly to the printer to insert into a file into the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse po@@ inters a while on the same spot ; it is thought to help people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ strain @-@ ins@@ ect syndrome ) and that every mouse click pain@@ s .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot . it is thought to help people suffer from the rep@@ etic of the jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain@@ s . this requires however a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can switch to the pain while exercising mouse , and helps to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer from pain using the use of your computer . unfortunately , you should consult a doctor , if this is not yet done .
to make it even more clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps during clicking with the mouse , it &apos;s anti @-@ pain , us@@ eless . and like with all ergonomic relief devices , the result can be quite different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse motion and runs a mouse click , once you break the movement short .
is the smart shi@@ fting activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button . now move the mouse , waiting until the Los@@ ing of the mouse button . the smart shi@@ fting requires a little practice , but you will get rid of it quickly .
this devast@@ ation time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click leads .
if it is switched on , the rotary field shift ( 1 / 10 s ) is enabled . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting ; after shut@@ down the mouse button , before leaving the mouse button , if the mouse is done .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse sliding . this function is activated , followed by a break , one click with right mouse button . this movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can get to sh@@ orten the response time . open on Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the Tab@@ s General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer where you can set up a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; please refer to the respective documentation to find out how you will automatically start a program automatically .
set up all the settings back when opening dialog . have you already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the user after the last press .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , initially with pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart shi@@ fting should be disabled first . if you then click on the automatic mouse , you can later take the intelligent shift .
if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease sounds .
first , you should consci@@ ously make a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window , which cannot use any link . you can park the mouse at such places , until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is t@@ ruck@@ ed , you should clean your mouse . this is normally quite simple . the tri@@ ck is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse , but also the rolls that come in contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . like this happens , mouse is to mouse different . but it should be clear , however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you should have to see the rolls . these are attached to the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the tri@@ ck and dirt can scratch easily with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when just a shift step was started . if you &apos;re using a shift step , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can &apos;t end anymore due to the mouse button .
this happens if you are using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; set back and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use mouse to place the cur@@ sor as you want . but if you want to make it possible . however , if you want to make sure that the mouse click on a neutral area of desktop that the mouse buttons are un@@ washed . secure zones for the mouse buttons and menus and the track lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart shi@@ fting , but I do not create it to edit text .
the smart shi@@ fting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes his time before moving it into the clip@@ board and add to any other action when you want to move into the clip@@ board . but it will probably be ready to cause any other problems . here are some advice about it :
do not use the smart shi@@ fting to use , if you just want to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click on the one end of the text area , and hold the switch button , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and re @-@ press the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always be played when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is ex@@ pressing a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the smart shi@@ fting without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it requires some exercise .
in order to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you have to install the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should already be the case .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and configured it correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; used the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inters short dist@@ orted . this program was designed for people who suffer on RS@@ I Syndrome and to those working of the mou@@ ths pain@@ s .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as a certain time waiting for a pulling @-@ process begins before the mouse is left off . this way can also be done using your mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can &apos;t speak any computer to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can talk the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk course , which should be spoken once again .
on the first side of the wiz@@ ard ( left screens ) enter the command , which is used later for voice output text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dial@@ ogs .
on the second page , select the default text @-@ pass@@ age@@ book . you can choose to choose the Text passages you often need to type in . the passages may be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screens ) determine the dictionary for the word @-@ heating . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of single words . in addition , you can view the words with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary that only valid words into Wor@@ lds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially contains a input field for the ke@@ yp@@ assing of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and an exp@@ iration @-@ memory of the already spoken propositions ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; you can set correctly in the input field , enter the propositions which you want to hear . each spoken sentence will be attached to the run @-@ memory . you can choose from it that once again spoken .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialogue contains two cards , voice output and settings , page word @-@ crossing and page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the box card speech give the command to call the language . in the select field under the input field , insert the string to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . select the check box if the text remains unchanged as default input at the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is distributed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to speech output from your voice generator . this command you will find in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this you can find in the app@@ endix .
with possible kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth is used as the first attempt to pass the text to K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the following settings will be further developed on this page . the option for this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
the first selection box after the selection of a text passage determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text box book or in the bar for passages .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passage is inserted directly and in addition to the transfer memory , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ box closing of the editing window , you can define if the text box book will be automatically stored in the closing of the processing window .
with the selection of text @-@ pass@@ age@@ book , the book is stored . if you disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ age@@ book is not stored . please select to store &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text box book is to be saved .
the page word @-@ related page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word @-@ crossing . in addition to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than a dictionary . using this selection box you can select the currently used dictionary to use password .
using buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , modify the order of books or export them into a file . below the list , you can set up the language and select the language for the dictionary .
for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation one . the frequency of the single words is determined simply by elimin@@ ating the occurrence . in addition , you can add the Word list with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert just right @-@ written words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to summar@@ ize the available spell dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks which should be combined dic@@ tion@@ aries , and how these weigh@@ ted should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , create a new , blank dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ entered into the dictionary automatically generate a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main window of the window for processing tex@@ tures is divided into two . in the upper part , the Text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ list . if you have a text file book , you can only change its name .
promotions like new passages or books to add or delete selected text passages and books either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of passages and passages may be made by drag by mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of loading memory is used .
the selected text is copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of loading memory is used .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the exp@@ iration will be used .
if the menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool@@ bar is indicated with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is displayed directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling , the tool can be moved to another .
is this menu entry in the lower part of the main window with references about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hat@@ ched .
if the menu entry is crossed , a sliding body is displayed with entries . the l@@ ath is placed by default in the tool@@ bar directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling , the tool can be moved to another place .
probably you do not have the command for voice output not properly or not completely . open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card language output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer related details . )
Festival is a language edition system of Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use a festival for free and spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of command line for the language output , it is believed that festival is installed in the directory / usr / local / festival . the command for speech output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of command line for the installation of speech output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the directory / usr / local / fre@@ let . the language output is then possible with one of the following command samples :
for the third example , the option must send the data as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ akers in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ solve the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ eme MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / h@@ adi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would like to be swal@@ lowed up the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore elabor@@ ated as in the other examples :
( CAT ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be switched on .
the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ continues voice service , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ output systems .
since the language run is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use des@@ kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on individual computers and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that cannot be able to leave text by the machine . it is a list already saved in pro@@ found@@ ly propositions which can always be re @-@ increased again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in filtering , text is processed , before being sent to a program of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation to replace incorrec@@ tly spoken words or short@@ cuts , or to select appropriate language and speaker or to deal with specific defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four kinds of lyrics .
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders . if the edition of the Screen Reader is read , the received orders are continued again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning will notice and keeps the output of messages and usual text . these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example used for an application that allows for news . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page you can see , just entering the room . &amp; k@@ ota ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about it .
the rest are easy text orders . every order you encounter with the card ticket orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example for a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in waiting @-@ long , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application is sending the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a figur@@ ative , this edition will be stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen editing . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filter process the text and go on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify either as words or as regular expressions , which enable the creation of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons as : - ) by text or for formatt@@ ing messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intellig@@ ible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format into another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with voice instructions filtering , you can send orders dependent on the content of the text , or dependent on the text , sent to a speaker . if you have to set a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE @-@ News about it .
each of these different filters can be applied to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter is fixed , its rules does not indicate that the text remains unchanged at the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent by all activated filters , which were set up on the page below . the processing by the filters are displayed in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal standard filter . it does not have an output , it is not activated and is not used . filters are being modified from top to bottom .
Click here to insert a new filter . choose the type of filter , and it will be displayed next to the following configuration dial@@ ogues .
for the installation of strings or regular expressions , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison list , then the text is replaced by the associated substitute text . major and small letters will not be considered when compared .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose a name for this name , it simply needs to distinguish itself from the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replace it in accordance with the strings from the column . the list is displayed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
Click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
using these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter is only used when the spokes@@ man speaks for the text order one of the languages here . Click on the button to hold a list of languages . you can also hold several languages when mouse click the &amp; Ctrl ; key .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only used when the text is specified by one of the specified applications . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID @-@ run programs will receive you with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers have to be taken away . if you have , for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; enter the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 , you are allowed to set up only .
the string filters can only be applied to text when all conditions with an entry in the box Apply filter . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words uses the fonts filter regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must be limited to both sides ( blank ) both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions can be found in the package .

enter the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
you can send texts on a designated speaker , which is set up on a designated speaker , or at a speaker with specific properties . you can specify that texts by k@@ mail can be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text on the filter gives it a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that provides the program to write the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send and the characteristics of the speaker card spokes@@ man , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied , if the text is applied to the regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions , you can call this by clicking on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the properties of the desired microphone conditions . if the text meets the above shown filter conditions , the spokes@@ man is selected to display the desired requirements on the wid@@ est . Click on the button on the right to display the dialog speakers selection .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program uses a customiz@@ able module architecture for voice synthesis . if you want to expand &amp; dict@@ ts ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , use the developer team in conjunction with the development team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for support SS@@ ML and for XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ del@@ ib@@ s and the developer files for the program &quot; tool disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you apply the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; refer to the source text file for k@@ de@@ es or have downloaded all night currently created Tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if you are using a speech disp@@ at@@ cher with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Con@@ figur@@ ator SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program dict@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be further developed so that the installation of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible , and the SPD @-@ conf script is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sets . the user can return or cancel @-@ return , repeat or cancel the output .
if an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts , you can request the characteristics of the preferred microphone for the output . if you like a speaker is used , whose language is English and whose sex is used , otherwise , if you want to learn more about the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts ; a person out , see in .
when you click on the cartridge &quot; button , click on &quot; Add or Edit &quot; button , and click &quot; Edit &quot; button will be displayed . for example , the cartridge card will be shown below the module for the Festival of Interactive . details on the modules you will find below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . when the path comes to festival in PAT@@ H , you just need to enter the festival .
select the encoding for text , which is handed over to the Festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; they are automatically made . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 to use eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sl@@ ack@@ ers , you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t choose some kno@@ b and this grey can &apos;t be displayed , the chosen voice will not be displayed .
some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices will already be syn@@ thes@@ ized during the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( for larger storage consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set any speaker ( or don &apos;t forget to use ) .
if this check box is marked by kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the icon in the system phase is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to indicate the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr runs on the system , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD appears to read a text . thus , you have the possibility to read or to control .
here are all orders in the qu@@ eu@@ e , together with the application that set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card reader .
with buttons in this row , you can see Satan in the list below that is selected or returned in the list below ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also be reduced to other cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol section in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the card audio . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; see in .
select the type of audio output . if one component can &apos;t be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without assistance for the corresponding audio module , or kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ aim@@ ing or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to have at least one module , select the PCM @-@ device . see also
set the intercom speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % matches about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal Inter@@ phone speed . thus , these settings can be installed , the program SO@@ x must be installed .
Click on users to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; dict@@ ts ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices are all PCM @-@ Devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
in this map card you can setup special actions , which will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders :
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders . after the edition of the Screen Reader was read , the received orders are resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have higher priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is always reserved . a warning keeps the output from messages and usual text . these orders are continued after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can welcome someone who enters straight ahead .
will be a text order interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , add &amp; dict@@ ts ; the audio output to the qu@@ eu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this cartridge card only apply to normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern there are no special actions when they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages can be read , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on al@@ erts . the box card noti@@ fications .
select this check box to switch the preview of &amp; k@@ de ; dis@@ abling . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before .
is this setting marks , al@@ erts where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
to add these buttons to add events to list or delete events . if you click on the button , a dialogue where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sends , if somebody mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing is specified in the list , are igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ red .
use this selection box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event meets , you have the following selection :
if you select custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter the properties of the desired intercom . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the user card spokes@@ man as the upper@@ most entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a specific application of a particular application , this will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the specific application . otherwise , the action is used to carry out under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can specify the notification of messages as follows :
use the button to store the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . if you want to load the settings from a file . if you want to start stored settings , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Dis@@ cri@@ ptions are deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , voice speed , sex , sex , voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as it is the standard voice , the festival in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings are set for speed or audio in the festival configuration dialog , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start reading , because only the first sentence must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not to stop or cancel , or cancel , even if the language syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set to set a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter . you can change their settings or add further Sat@@ al recognition filter , but we will not use it .
on the easi@@ est way , you can learn the device selection , select the speaker and select text . turn on the card selection , select some properties and check out how the user &apos;s selection has changed . for this , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start with the pre@@ reading , since only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long ,
if you want to stop orders , or break orders on the card , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal movement identi@@ fier filter automatically set up when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be removed only . change nothing to this filter , unless you know what you do .
pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filters compare text with a regular expression of Sat@@ z@@ enden and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the diagrams ( input characters automatically from the text ) . please note that the default setting is included in the character .
S@@ BD filter are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ itt@@ ens ) , war@@ nings , news or the output of screen editing .
if you have removed from default the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filters you can re @-@ insert this again by loading the default _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
in the box tab , you can write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if
use of standard speaker ( the top one on the card reader ) . in other words , no talk properties will be specified .
use of the fitting Inter@@ phone , which has all features of a furnished speaker , el@@ ect or edit , el@@ ect &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker is chosen . otherwise , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the original features of the original features .
select the method to input the desired microphone properties by clicking on one of the select buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired database . if this feature does not play any role , nothing will give .
select this check box if the property should have priority to other features . you can also choose several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the edition , this feature is rarely used . you will use this feature rarely if you want to specify attribute language if you want to know a specific application text in another language when working in the working environment .
to apply all the properties in the field of speaker , you can use the following commands to use the select button , and then click on Speaker , which corresponds to the following .
in this case , 0 for the last text order in the qu@@ eu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required 0 ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr st@@ alls immediately , if it is started . I have de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t receive trac@@ e@@ ability .

the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work when I play simultaneously with another application of music . if I get a text order , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message indicating that says : &apos; to open PCM .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts can occur at AL@@ SA , which allows for simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices . references to possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected .
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I have installed them and can &apos;t use it in Festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr shows this voice .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / Vo@@ ices to serve the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; if you &apos;ve found the voice , to the developers .
in the map audio card , there is a setting speed . thus , the program SO@@ x installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed inter@@ ferences . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are igno@@ red if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is your own tags , with which the speed is controlled according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you &apos;re very bra@@ ve , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and put the phone speed up .
I do not realize that web pages are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER seems not to work . in order to convert the X@@ SL @-@ file to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I &apos;ve added an own character set filter and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; not to go back or back . on the cart@@ el orders , the order is displayed only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
interventions ( point , question mark , exc@@ lamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not filter . use a filter to pro@@ posi@@ tional detection instead .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , its source code is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported by many voices , you can adjust volume , talk speed , and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ; set .
you need to install at least one language . help you find out the instructions given with the Festival . you would like to read web@@ pages you need to install updated ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations during the transfer .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you set the Russian voices you need to enter the votes MS@@ U _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look at the first time on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , this option needs to be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ ic as an example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ive analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; produced from it the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; cr@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that enables the network interface , routing , and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings through a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; cris@@ p @-@ box ; -@@ Package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , displayed . the module network settings ( kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; scar@@ let hardware ; network hardware can &apos;t install . physical equipment and their drivers have already been installed and configured to configure &amp; cr@@ ush work@@ conf ; it allows the device to set up the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . network devices will be added later , the drivers have to be loaded by adjusting the following files , corresponding to kernel version :
the Network Settings module is loaded when the network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . starting from the module network settings , this , the platform is automatically recognis@@ able to recognize the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the platform is offered , the platform is to select the platform that distribution and release is best . by marking the setting of non @-@ re @-@ questions , the network settings can be met permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will then be pre@@ set automatically .
changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed , what does the settings can only be viewed , changing the system management mode to the right bottom end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the tab Network interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed :
setting up the settings shown can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button to setup a dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . Click the button to display the dialog with further possibilities .
when selecting automatically the TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server , all required TCP / IP settings for each system start is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected in the system , corresponding to the system .
using the selection manual , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . the network mask is required .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values set in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address would not be used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can specify if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on . activate one ad network device via selecting from the list and click on interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off after necessary . off from a activated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and click to disable interface ....
in addition , the IP address of the computer is fixed in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s physical connection to remote networks and is used by default in TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway computer is to be selected .
a computer with DNS support will be replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if computers are only IP @-@ addresses . if the computer is only IP @-@ address , DNS trig@@ gers this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine for the name resolution part of the equ@@ ator name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or amended wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be arranged or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the priority .
by pressing the button to add ... from the group of hosts a DNS server , a DNS server can be added to the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the button to click . the entry will then be inserted into the list .
from the group of calculator for nam@@ ing resolution you choose one entry and then click on the button edit .... It will display the editing dialog .
the list of well @-@ known computers describes computer @-@ to @-@ IP address references to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting , if no DNS server are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS @-@ servers .
normally the list of well @-@ known computers contains several entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ages ; and some special IPv6 addresses . this is still in the test version of IP should replace 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The Dialogue New alias will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known machine and click the button to click . if the well @-@ known computer has several alias name , de button adding several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computers from the list and select Edit .... The dialog is displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of the static hosts will be updated .
the settings provided in Module network settings are not immediately applicable to the system . in order to enable the changes , the following command must be depos@@ ed .
the homepage of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and others are required .
this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; cris@@ p work@@ conf . these commands should make this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology are given , in the second all by &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; changeable configuration files are discussed .
this area can not replace detailed knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never found great distribution . IPv6 is expected to use in the near future . this description is currently focusing on the standard IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to as@@ sign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; Work@@ station is the administrator , which can be used as a valid IP address , if available , the IP address can not be chosen arbit@@ r@@ arily .
when placing an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from table below are not forwarded during the Internet , therefore their arbit@@ rary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , the addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 is usually used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called Standard route that is the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP transmission .
the network address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circuit .
in this section the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; cr@@ et@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file can sometimes be dynam@@ ically changed with DSL connection , so that if in case of active DSL connections , another content is set to be set there .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ ck@@ config . another stand may be expected .

&amp; dat , is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . the first goal was offered to create several archives on a band . the second target was a question for tar which asked my wife : how much longer does it take ?
before a band can be used , it must be of &amp; dat , which can be mounted on three ways :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; dat , playing the band and reads the pre@@ ten@@ ant information of the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recognize &amp; dat , who won &apos;t be formatt@@ ed on the band if the band is formatt@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
detects &amp; dat , looking for the matching index on your disk . can &apos;t be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drives , to indicate that the band became involved . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched for the band by means of the entry for the band .
before selecting the ban@@ ker , initially , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; dat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a change of the symbol to reco@@ gn@@ ise the band that the band has been solved and shows an appropriate message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ arded without danger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before a band of &amp; dat , it must be formatt@@ ed by &amp; dat , formatt@@ ed .
a band species must be formatt@@ ed before you need to use file format before you need to formatt@@ ed the band . if you need to formatt@@ ed a band before using the band of &amp; dat , it does not have formatt@@ ing the tape of tape , DA@@ T drives cannot be formatt@@ ed .
after entering the band name and the capacity , the band will continue with the formatt@@ ing of the tape . after completion of the tape , the band will be automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the backup process . that can be done on three ways :
choose a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is secured .
mark a secure profile profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the Move Corner menu ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog for Backup . in this dialog you can check even the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . dialogue shows the progress of securing output including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test procedure was started , the dialog for Settings . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking .
if you confirm the settings for checking , the dialog will appear . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can forward the restore , the files that are re @-@ produced are selected , which can be selected in two ways :
choose a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Rest@@ ore ....
once the recovery process was started , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for restoration .
when you confirm the settings for restoration , the dialog appears rest@@ oring . this dialogue shows the progress of recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it &apos;s necessary to re @-@ create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the tape @-@ containing . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can comp@@ ose the index in two ways :
this is a secure profile profile with the just selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a Secure profile :
the current working folder where the backup should be done . the list of associated files will be automatically updated according to the chosen key folder .
for all folders that are listed under the backup files that are specified in the same file system , just like the folder . files that are based on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . any entry will be viewed by tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is secured since then , only the files have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
this del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes that all files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
the settings can be set via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in menu settings . the following settings can be set :
the complete path to the device file system for tape drive ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path must indicate the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; dat , before the band is connected to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary to be carried out prior to read or write operations .
if the option is switched on , tried &amp; dat , the throw from the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the pin is igno@@ red by loos@@ ening &amp; dat , automatically re@@ ject the tape . do not use this option at flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , tried &amp; dat , all drives support variable block sizes for tape drives . no matter whether this setting is active or not you need &amp; dat , in any case the block size for your tape drive will communicate .
if &amp; dat , a band de@@ formatt@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should prove only one memory block on the tape . the contents of this file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is bil@@ ling : seconds , whereby the name of the system is formatt@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the ep@@ och , which has been formatt@@ ed to the band .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name at the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / folder .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar @-@ archives created directly with &amp; GNU ; tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not to be incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup band . this symbol is only active if a band is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system log . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system , or where system allows you to get information about your system , or where system enables quick access to access information about problems related to your server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the program is appropriate for in@@ experienced users that can &apos;t know where to get information about your system , or where system files can be stored in the different protocol .
in addition , &amp; system@@ log ; experienced users can perform fast access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; system@@ log ; therefore , some extended functions can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol @-@ files certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in addition to the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following commands , displays &amp; k@@ system log ; functions available to easily filter the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching &amp; k@@ system@@ log , first the system log file is tried to open , and it opens up a small news window , so you will not open it with system administrator right . the protocol files are usually not included in the file / var / log , for normal users , usually do not have access to reading .
you can also use the filter tool@@ bar to filter for a certain crit@@ eri@@ on or according to set strings . in default , the list of the log lines will be automatically displayed . in default , the protocol line will be displayed , if in one of the columns contain the strings of the filter search .
you can also select another entry in this position . then , for example , select the column process in the corresponding column . in addition , for example , in the protocol @-@ file system protocol , you can also tell you &amp; k@@ system log ; all the minutes @-@ lines , which were sent and created by this process .
this option is enabled in default settings and helps you to reco@@ gn@@ ise the key protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a stri@@ k@@ ingly color as a protocol lines . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched on setup dialog .
do you want to show this process only ( e.g. in the system log or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( PID ) in the column process , for example , if you would like to examine the output of a specific command such as for example to the start of the Samba server . in this case , you can use filter bar .
in addition , you can select the option to set new lines in the main window menu , in order to view all the new add @-@ in lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple minutes files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ windows . once you select a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has your own website on htt@@ p : / / system@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. you find more information about the information sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V in@@ it Editor , rather well known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V in@@ it develops quickly to the standard for control program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it &apos;s easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects ( such as I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is therefore under / etc and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V in@@ it without any re@@ installation and re @-@ format . therefore , you need to ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was there .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it differs from the BSD in@@ it that configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc / etc . this folder is r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to run on another run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services does not include such things like set@@ serial that is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be , rather than / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel sear@@ ches at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first thing that he finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre@@ set @-@ made run@@ level 3 is . if you &apos;d like to change it / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab , then you can repair it , then get it to re @-@ repair the system and execute the following :
but how does it now start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d scripts .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written that there is a argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would read the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script will be called on the stop ( if he is a S ) , the script will be called with the argument .
some people want to establish a simple way to establish machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level , just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . running . furthermore I could have a user @-@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand @-@ device is simple to say tri@@ vi@@ al : simply drag an entry in the area of availability system services to one of the six round level to launch it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can change scripts even between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within one levels by taking it different . this will only happen if you prefer an entry from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only take an entry in the area of availability system services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed when you move this into a new section . in order to select a new run@@ level , you have to select from the Edit menu or select from the context menu -- even if the same entry has already existed in the destination area previously .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the ambient entries before you can try to insert the system service .
note : there is currently no option to restore items which have been thrown into the paper basket . so you be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to activate the various working areas ( Available System services , run@@ level 1 Start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous .
to move an entry into another round @-@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctrl ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with Ctrl ; V ) .
to manually change sorting order or change the button to change the Properties dialog . specify the dialog button to accept the dialog to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ lose the changes .
because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the menu require confirmation before they will be executed .
all settings are taken in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available , otherwise it will be available from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise it will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard lap@@ tops , and now the machine starts to constantly new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and modify the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which only exist in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
this species , such as system services started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : please check whether all configuration files are required ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply without message if their configuration files are not present or incorrec@@ tly set .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be of version different . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user ; reading .
after changing changes , you have to save them . either use the appropriate tool@@ bar or entry in the menu file .
&amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cartridge cards , user and user ranking . for editing the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group features .
some cartridge cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have extended system settings , you will find individual settings , if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d will be installed like in BSD univers@@ es .
the map pass is appears when shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD .
this cartridge card is only enabled in case for at least one embedded file system ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alize ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ as / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters on each user , although the limited liability in KB are :
these parameters can be adjusted separately for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of the field .
the card @-@ card groups informs about the group &apos;s ir@@ regul@@ arities of the selected user . the standard group that belongs to the user you can find in the Pri@@ mary Group . furthermore , the user can mark the user in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , add addition from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate execution button of the tool@@ bar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot Manager , add , remove and change the time to bo@@ oting the standard operating system , add the standard operational system , remove , modify operating systems , modify , modify and more .
