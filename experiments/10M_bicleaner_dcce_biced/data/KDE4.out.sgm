<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you're looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata to store the metadata in the installation page. if you forget that EXIF- and IPTC data can be written into the file, then you can manually select the metadata from the database by clicking the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? it represents a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should select any photo keyword, captions and evaluation. of course, you can choose the same attribute. you will start the best with the evaluation or the ranking. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's take us now with keyword, keywords, how to continue with other programs often hot, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogized images from a different source with embedded keyword, then the tree for you can set up the images to the right place. the modifying the hierarchy is no problem and can easily be done by removing a sub-tree to another. the changed keyword is being pursued by & digitised; updated during it the undertrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlap. this is a very big representation since each block of metadata in the truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data shows properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool to catalogues your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Don't want to watch anybody's photos, you want to share with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panoramic view. from the distance it is not even a nice beach panorama. if you are looking closer look at some details, people, place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you these of the Landeplatz of Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy, 60 years after landing, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. the label so you can even change your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others, consider their photos may be more important than the image itself to produce a story. if you're using images, you should tell a story about to help Him to help Him to understand what you move about the motive that you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok, if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can export a lot of text in an international alphabet (UTF-8) as a label. you can even export your images in web galleries, then these labels will tell you for your desired images in web galleries. you will have to tell it a second time for opening images.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different town without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures, the train leaves the spatial presentation now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities the antolocability are already innumerable and will soon be deeper in the future. I'm also able to export your journeys with geographic information. however, you can also export your travel to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with Google Earth maps.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a Word Game with Copyright and describes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of other.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you that information in the setup page of & digitites can be seen as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym of author and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has been created, then the name of a company or organization is to be used, then the name of a company or organization should not be changed once. this field does not support Kommas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author line): associated with the author. examples of this field contains the title of the photographer. examples of this field may be entitled: employee photographer, free-lance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the Autorenfeld, this field must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): use the bideter field to identify who this photo. if the photographer works as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be shown here. if the picture is an image, then the group / agency will be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this is not a bit more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator, this is a bit more important than basic metadata. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique on the basis of the digital watermark. & digitised in the near future a module for forklifts are available.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate errors, power failures, power stroll, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, Despaving, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire. this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section there are problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which has reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, you can't have any more than a few years. of course, you can also hold your CDs and DVDs in Archivquality. of course, you can get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 pieces that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you believe it is in your measurable room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk into the right way. the best DVD Capture Devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much reliable. it is thus turning the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for mistakes, even if you just have been written. 75% of the data are only effective for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they need them through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a favourable program called IsoBuster's apparently wonderful works on CDs and DVDs. it's also running for Macs. it's also not available for Macs. it's also not available for Macs, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to save the format-war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD containing 8.5 GB. everything was also said for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn your data back to high-quality media in a non-binding format. check out the media with a description, date & author markings before and then copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discourse manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves. your production of production include a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a big field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks: disk study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: under the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C, the error rate increases significantly. electronic parts of the controller are boosting this error. some of SMART confirmed this error. these are especially readers and publishing houses. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only about the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also use data loss due to a power if you have the files without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most of electrical devices does not matter much, what can cause devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause heavy damage to your computer. thus, these anomalies can cause damage and other defects, so protect motherboards and other defects. protect yourself to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most popular protection against power spikes is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbs a part of energy flashes and is normally available in the form of a plug-in bar. however, remember that every plug-in bar contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should ensure that it guarantees the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. they should also ensure that it protects against flash rash and thereby protecting the connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since a overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should also ensure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modem, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for coaxial cable of cable modem and television.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overvoltages, these devices can provide automatically battery energy when running a power failure. if you want to run your data and run the system. if you want a UPS, you should be sure that they should get the same quality standards like a overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software will be interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its security in rapids with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection may be used for less than & Euro; 20. this is just a small price difference. at the end you should always remember all the cables. you should go back into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can connect this as a drive to & Linux; Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any data on data.</seg>
<seg id="198">In comparison to the hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB cost per dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost per dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it's not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com provides online storage services that are limited to photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online. for $25 a year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of the data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are adjusted automatically and with the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. therefore they are Despaving certain.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transfers are susceptible to data transmission errors. the file system and btrfs make sure the data integrarity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances have occurred. all these disturbances remain untroubled. no one seems to think that it should have no protection for it. nobody seems to think about it. the Internet with his TCP protocol is a considerably safer data away than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses, as they generate interactions within the data streams. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, thousands of errors are seen per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates back to lower levels. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that soon it is available for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started an own initiative with its blafs file system. this is still in alpha status. it is still using the same protective mechanisms that is used for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not appreciate it! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% when notebooks were already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the masters. it is limited to less damage as e.g. theft or re-installations; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer than any longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. here you will find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of investigation process at sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided even before the problem has occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: incorrect, theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 stops from fundamental physical boundaries. it is that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural limit for that progress. sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in direction of 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is very worsened for compact cameras and high-quality optics. even DSLR cameras have the optimum range for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or bigger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is available today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone affected by any data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by any data loss before you make any more dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, lightning strikes if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot. forget about aircraft gap: fire, water, electricity, children and thumbles are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Despaving always means local storage. bring your sighting up the staircase, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above already is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup which is not available immediately, then you can save the one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files must be secured. this is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy of one time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup. created a complete moment of torque at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup the files have been changed since the last backup. created multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes next with a versioning system on the next with the exception, which is only abgeted and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool which you can easily create on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, I copied only the difference of files that actually happens. this happens and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach provides you enough time to restore losses and restore. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. each additional dilution should be done manually after which you have a complete examination.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC data, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reinventing pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">That valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year, that about the period in which you are really interested in you, because they should remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider everything today. unfortunately, there is no other option to evaluate the current system. every 5-8 years, you should ask yourself how the current system are used backwards. the less variations in the past are, umso easier to rate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system, it's important for reading your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite easy: any time when you modify your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the reference pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. actually, this means always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go from that you have the scalability with incorporated, and you want to enlarge a dedicated disk or partition. in * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and store it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / SDC # Source can / dev / SDC # Source can / dev / SDC # Source can be / dev / SDC / MSDS; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; fixed resize / dev / sdc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can be read, then you can create those yourself. this task will make this task a year simpler.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard, but it can replace too much more. it's loss-free, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can provide so many administration information, but not as many as TIFF, and recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can store pictures in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can download your images in this format. however, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open resource file format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it also sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to incorporate the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is possible to store their data into one file itself. file information will be stored in one file itself. file extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original of your recording, mostly in the original file, too. XMP is capable of converting to problems when linking metatendatei and image file. therefore, you should consider if you are using DNG as containers and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible Online metadata standards in the DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures are using the camera dium, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your repository. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a hostile processing you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them in webgaleries, you can use in MPEG, use in contact form, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; in the section adding a photos to your hard disk, you can already add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your album-database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; use it with the calculator, turn off the camera on the display mode and turn it. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, you try to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a fertile indicator appears at the bottom. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file rules for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. appear on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you might need to view the camera information on each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information that can be saved internally by the camera. one symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras don't have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal Metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer of remark, GPS etc. this information is the same as in the metadata panel bar, or the image processing. please note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then select the photos of their camera into a single album in & digiplug; when downloading, we will not be deleted if you have downloaded images in an album before downloading the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, select the desired option with the standard optional methods of & kde; select the button you can download the button. download the button selected as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available now. these pictures have been downloaded until now. in this case, the new pictures have been selected by star in preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons from anywhere or selected, a dialog with which you can select the target album. list of existing albums will be sorted according to normal folders. details of the folder can be found in the My Computer List. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After having selected the target album, press OK, and & digitily; invites the pictures from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera by removing the button deleting. if you want to delete the button you need to delete this first and then delete the delete Selected combination.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no possibility to restore the photos that you have deleted from the camera. they should not be deleted from the camera. if you want to delete the camera, you should erase your camera. if you want to delete the camera. if you want to delete the camera, this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful. the file names are usually loaded after the photos taken from the camera. this may be meaningful if you have photos of different recording sessions into the same album. therefore, it can be useful, the date and time to integrate it into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and spin-based signatures. if you use this latter option, automatically creates a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the broadcast opens three further options, which are carried out before the photos stored on the record. if you select the corresponding entries from the EXIF data into the IPTC fields. with the latest option, you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another date format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% -% d% H:% M:% M. for further adjustments you should read the command strftime. for further adjustments you should read.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera file name, you have the possibility to change file names in small letters, or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digiplug; for a photo is used below the name, which displays the camera into preview. your settings will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitily; can all information be carried out on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation while processing. not all cameras make this information ready. in the sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera doesn't supply this information, you can switch off the picture in original orientation. if you continue off the automatic rotation, use button extension and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been done on the date, at which the photo was made available, you can download the picture data. all pictures with the same date are uploaded into the same record. not all cameras represent this information. in the sidebar meta data you can read which information embedded into photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, stores & digiplug. if you want to change this option. if you want to change this option, use the button extension and select the option Dates-based subverbs at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from your computer to your camera is the button to download. the file selection dialog is available, which you should be uploaded to the file. you can also select more than a file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digitiff; she, where the pictures are uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear. select the desired folder and press OK to delete the upload. images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. thus, it is a position that can be displayed in longitu- and latitude. the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographer can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic place. not everyone uses a plane to share an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've got later, where exactly the photo was done, you can open a postcard to another & digiplug; user may wish to document the place where the photos may be localized, or simply only to document the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data are supported in the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 has many GPS data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reproduction of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated with GPS receiver. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, but you need to save these data in GPX format as it is the only format which is supported by the module for geographical mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitution or other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the sign related coordinates, i.e. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road types. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data into the corresponding IPTC-field. this metadata is not only available in the database and not only in the database of & digitization; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digiplug; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images save as embedded lettering (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you want to read in pictures with the images mentioned in the images. note: in pictures, which already mentioned labels, they are overwritten by & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse pointers can appear in the main window over a file. depending on selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats. to specify which file types & fixtures, displaying the file extension to the list and remove any of these extensions, which no these extensions supported by & digich; are ignored by digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by clicking the button updates on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminance of & digiplug; can then open these settings if possible. some images are then switched on. some images, however, are not available. if you have different sizes and the synchronous mode, you should only use fast computers. if you have one, then you can enjoy better options.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can switch this here if you use the toolbar in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of the image can be selected with dark or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing this view can be switched on with F10 and F11 and switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling is meant that the images are encoded in higher resolution of luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the next statement.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG-files. this operation decreases the image quality, since PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a quick machine, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF-files you can switch the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF-images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the deflate algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss of loss-free JPEG 2000 files you can easily save loss-free adjustment. even if you have written loss of loss and file size far better than with normal JPEG. metadata was not yet supported, but it was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digitiri, image processing was only one image viewer for photos. currently it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the image processing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all the green pixels are equal to sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels of unloaded lines, this option creates a bit soft, eliminates this problem with a minimum loss of details, but eliminates the 2x2 patterns with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white is used like the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed colour balance which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors won the effect that subexposed images in four steps. for other cameras this option will be ignored for other cameras.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-light, so the parts of your images are to catch the advanced white in the settings. the setting colors are using some unusual results because they are most advanced in various Rosatönen. most recently, you can try some parts of missing information from the top performers.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible, as blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red. & digitised to reconstruct the missing green and red shares of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white want you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can be adjusted separately for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminance value to your taste. you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the default 1. this may also be done in the image options of & digitization; in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should be conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process, in order to obtain a complete picture of the part-filtered image sensor, which have many cameras and is known for a matrix-coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Farbrella.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiab, and Dcraw make you three alternatives at your disposal: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation (Variable Number of gradient) was the first algorithm created by Dcraw, but produces color artefacts on the edges. image inear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour softening of your lenses, you can put the red and blue corrections values here. this is certainly the best method for a color reflex correction, since it is performed during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and returns instructions like these again. there are also LCMS and & digitization; information such as the colour information of one color space in the others are as precise as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / colour management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder, click here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you can save all your profiles. & digiplug; examines these folders then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are not administrated by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturer and model which you are using. not all profiles are mounted on the same type. currently, dcrab gamma does not have to match up to 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options such as the Soft-Proof-profile, which you can emulate the image of a device, as your printer can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are very saturated, instead of using the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, a table of cameras and profiles can be combined together. this answer is naturally inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile extension leaves the style for the purpose: F for exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plug-in interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image view and image processing is supported; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of available modules. then you want to use and these are loaded by & digitiers. these modules appear as new entries in the menu's menu and also refer to some of the menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shortcuts for tasks that are done by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be found via the KIPI project at http: / / www.tipi-plugin.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diashau should be easy to understand. the upper knobs can adjust the time between the image transitions, usually are 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes switches on the metadata respectively, which are lit at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show a list of all-time supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which is trying to identify the camera properly. currently, you make sure that the camera is properly connected, enabled and in the image line mode, below are serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can place the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera from the camera box. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / gging, specify your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; you have to connect the camera to your computer, switching it to the display mode and switch on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digiplug; the camera will automatically detect. if not, you can set up camera models and port manually. after you have set up camera models and manually, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras from the main window. if you have more than a camera, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option Order dialog for the shift of &gt; pictures in the trashcan display, you can adjust the discussion of & digiplug; for deleting a photos in an album. here, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right sidebar can be used tacit by & digitization; if you use the option to switch changes to the right sidebar without any request. otherwise, you need to apply changes to the button modifications.</seg>
<seg id="333">It also allows you to display the display panel of & digiplug; when starting, this accelerates the start-up and digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="334">If you're looking for new photos to look for new photos, digiplug for new or deleted albums or photos. if something from the base folder was deleted, then asks & digitiff, she asks if it's deleted from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digiplug; to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can be found under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be seen below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in making a new design for & digitization; you will find more information about this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can view it to view your photos and to the correction or improvement. image processing can be started with a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or selection of entry displays / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of which are available as modules in & digiplug; therefore, they are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you can find in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, no the functions will change the original photo before you want to save File Save or button store from the toolbar, if you cannot recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should definitely make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file saving as desired.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image from the menu or restore image processing in toolbars. you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be reversed or restored. last promotion, you can easily restore, editing or restore, editing and restore editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should review the shortcut, Ctrl; -z, and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you push the & LMB; over the course or restoring button in the toolbar, select a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are made between again and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image runder or the entries in the menu file. if you want changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in the photo and zoom out in the toolbar Ctrl; mouse wheel or toolbar in the toolbar or use the entries in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you do not want to use the toolbar. if you do not want this, you can change the toolbar here. if you do not want this, you can call it from & digiplug; see the section to set up image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the actual picture, you can print it in the menu image and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can print the settings before using your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual pictures or whole sentences from your selection. you just need to select images with the standard methods and select from the album album Export printing assistent. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug; main window has a page bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available, also in the image processing, it is displayed if one of the five riders are clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same tab the sidebar will disappear or disappear in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the inscription view, you can insert the mark below. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are copied to EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications you should consider that restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented on, use either the button user or change simply to the next picture, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user-button there is a button More. you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting, which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The Assessment section shows an evaluation schema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. in order to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, choose them from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation will be written in the IPTC field. encoding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view reveals a search box for the keyword of the keyword, the keyword-tree and a selection box with previously used in this & digiplug; -session requested keyword.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given search result. you can easily restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many words.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief in the input of keyword. if you have different passwords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Words can also be placed by marking the corresponding checkboxes in the tree. all keywords are stored into the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword-tree, this is only applied to the selected image and not to the entire selection if you want a selection with a keyword, please refer to section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window. normally, one or more keyword filter is used on the right side, only the intersection of these two are displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop into the main view. if the keyword exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and then click on the selection. then a dialogue which you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter stands on no keyword. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and afterwards a keyword will be taken into the selection and put there. a dialogue asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it can be one or its, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and in the field of control.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): entry in the database is being sought. this may be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or character string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify a Extended search of all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to configure options, you just need the check box at the end of the rule, and then go to the button grouping. the options are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr? free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mostly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mostly used to digiplug; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you have a colorless workflow, which have a predictable deviation from actually recorded or scanned colors. with a colorless workflow, you can easily print the colors on your monitor using your camera or scanners like the colors that you can print or publish on the web from your digital nightclub.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is on colour administration, everybody wants to know what buttons does not want to make the results. unfortunately, the point of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color administration. additionally, you will provide you with deeper information about color administration. additionally, you will get your own informative decisions and get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows are fulfilled every six down of the criteria, you must not take care of colour administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated at sRGB colour space. (more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are sent via e-mail or the web, where sRGB the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and the life for all so simple, why should you use another color space, and do your thoughts on colour content?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB by sRGB in comparison to the colors that we really can see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see, the hugh-shaped region, and the colours in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger bullets, you'll visit Bruce Lindbloom excellent site and click Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to change my monitor? if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you work in sRGB colour space or not, you have to run your monitor, as sRGB, you have to run your monitor. if you're working as a monitor of sRGB, you have to use your monitor on sRGB-standard boxes, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use an ongoing manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, identical, automatic adjustment, and contrast, enlarge Automatic correction to automatically create the best. they will have to experiment the best with these effects, which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scalable over the entire picture, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without his color shaded. this feature is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method adjusts the brightness of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intact of an image, sometimes produces it only rubbish. it's a very powerful surgery that causes a very miracle during a picture or it was destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the rotor, green and blue canal. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast-contrast: this method improves contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture by sliding the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white thinks of & digiplug; is a semi-automated tool to carry out a white right-off photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is limited to some color space with 8-bit per color. in case you can perform areas with overexposed areas. in case you can perform the white immediately in the raw mode, which in 16-bit mode, your possibilities will fall better to the correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-equivalent algorithm protected by the laws of Pawel T. Jochym. it will launch it through the menu entry colors white comparison of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in the size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the tool is adapted. if you want to see the design of the tool. if you want to see the original box, then it is enough to see the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target pictures has a red markers. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is a histogram indicated that as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixel are very small Luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or sum will be displayed. the sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadows adjust you to improve your photos or down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls are used, you should use the colour temperature Pipette. press this button and then anywhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculation the colour temperature of white-equations. this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white comparison with the default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The Indicator Indicator increases the colours, if more than a color channel of the pixel is indicated. you will display the combined result in the white indicator. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any attitude of the white-equate you can now store in a text file and load later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets returns all the filter values to their default value and corresponding neutral white-equations. note that even neutral settings will be displayed another photo than your original. if your original image will change your original image.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the codification depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this encoding needs even more disc space, computing time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of rough images. color mapping can be performed by changing color profils. color mapping can be performed by the window for use of color profils. a detailed guidance for the use of color profils can be used.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color sound. this tool provides an integrated path that allows you to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously. this is useful if your camera or scanner always require the same error. in the manual for audio-correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of coating problems is the tool to count that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug; General tools displays four colour effects, a solar control effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon effect and an edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, an effect of which was created when one developed a partially developed pressure of a short flashlight. this was the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colours were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar cells. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase is finally created, that this is not to generate photophiier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect effect. the original image is the (1) and the processes (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -Effect. it differs from a saturation which he makes a stronger contrast effect, which makes the colours brilliant and smoother. try it easy, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the name of the brand name produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated color paints, but also some photographers, especially those who recovers hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrast channels. the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeat the strength of the Neonlight. for large images the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and therefore it is not unusual that you can correct the colour contrast and the brightness in the menu under colors. as soon as you are satisfied with the results you can use the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in bad light conditions, you can easily reduce the saturation problem. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation may take a good choice instead of increasing. all modifications may be achieved when you recommend this result, you can confirm the changes to Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple illumination-strength / contrast / gamma, the tool is very complicated for improvement of exposure. even if dialogue with this tool is very complicated, you need only the slide for the slide. in concrete, the three sliders underneath the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or the selected area. among the graphs are three shooting in the inside, the left-side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the knob and change on it, how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed dynamically. the preview will be dynamically updated, based on the settings of the image, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted if the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. in images the large areas of a constant color is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in preview of the original image to adjust the input of the shade, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range. there are also two knob values. however, the output values can be used to modify the output values. e.g., the compression rate can be used as background to create slightly different in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values will be automatically set depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. in addition, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be re-adjusted to all shadows, means and Sundays. if you want to use the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original figure for red, green, blue and luminescrow.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and you will find the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect just in preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the input field applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, and the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed dynamically, depending on your settings. on the right side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel via the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this cheese, two symbols are located between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures featuring a digital camera, the linear mode has a broad beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps in this case.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curventeil to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that bright tones are correspondent and associated image-pixel darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original score. create a point on this line and move it up and down, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: using these buttons, you can make exactly this. every curve you can have this file system stored and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp curve-format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you are using this method and the three color pipettes-buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadows, medium and sunshine. activate the colour pipette you want to use and click on the original screen to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you will get a indicator, i.e. you get the effect just in preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected in the Luminance canal. shadow and sun was applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer for & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour range of images. you can edit it from the menu-channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">You can select the color for the histogram with the channel selection box: this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and precipitation. the window of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as opposed to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the finish features a red markers. if you are positioning this in the image, a vertical line in the histogram shows you the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: knob for red, green and construction allows you to maintain the appropriate brightness as well. if you can also keep the appropriate color components. this is especially convenient if you have the corresponding colour components. this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the green black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color to a visible space, which sees the same spot in the colour canal, and whose crackers exists in every channel. if the case is possible, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colored first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any blender configuration allows you to store and load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and you will find the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect just in preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating for your abstraction. with the development of digital photography is black / white one step, since colour images can be easily converted to the machine. also with a set of film rolling profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film-coating with a green lens filter. this looks good for all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film-coating with orange lens filters. this improves country, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotary filter: simulates a black / white film-coating with a red lenticular filter. this creates dramatic effects and can simulate mooneness to day time. so, like the 003 Cokin (TM) rotary filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film-coating with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones during a bit of cold in the shadow of a pressure and re-development in a sepiat. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">By digiplug; tool texture can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, an old master, a pop-kind portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right and increases the depth of the depth or three dimensionality of texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text is applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified (2) to see. the relief model has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">A decorative frame can be added to the digiplug; a decorative frame can be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not a slight task. to keep his attention it is a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattered eye. under image frame, the module can be launched from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your image. continuously moving the picture with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), it is ideal for a pop-dimensional frame and decoratively adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: is the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is 1% to 50% limited.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio will have greater than the original, but especially if you have used the tool for side-ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert some formatted text into a picture at any spot. this is also possible at different places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with your mouse. simply use text size, orientation, color from the color size and the character set. the larger the picture, the bigger one must be the character set. for example, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you chosen for your text can be modified until you press the button "OK" after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">By digitization; Tool stencil allows you to create a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Image Template apply in image processing can be used to place templates across a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. if you want to add the PNG file format and you should add to maximum compressing of the file size. if you want to add an e-mail to the & digiplug; mailinglist digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the button base folder. select the folder to you click here. these settings will be notified for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the template, a tree view is reflected in a folder's folder. selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the picture. it will be centered to the position of mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button resides the resulting image. if you want to cut the template onto the entire picture. if you want to enlarge the template onto the whole picture, check the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the image and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">If you want to apply the template onto your picture. the image will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitiff; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it's very fast and simple but it creates especially in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Impotency mask works on the contrast of edges. indeed, it's not a bit annoyed. you can use it to find atmospheric Dunst and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three, because he really improves sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized pictures need a correction of sharpness. these elements are smaller than the dissolution. these elements can therefore be combined into a common color. however, this sharp edges can be printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more subsequently than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures have often been applied to camera internal loop. images in the raw format should always be sharpened in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner use a sharpenal filter already during the reading of the image. if you deactivate this, you get control over your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening strip. you can correct the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should be careful when the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also strengthens the space. in general, you find further information about the menu entry. you can find further further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too little bit soft. use the tool to correct softness with the menu entry, and experimenting something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog gives you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove muer from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help the image to work. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the default values do often produce good results and should first test the effect. if you produce the sharpness mask to strongly make noise and the impression of grates in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is like many pixels on each side of a ridge by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen images at best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blank image that is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a split up to the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. one can thus define a minimal difference between the killing of the filter and therefore beforehand between the killing of sharpening, and therefore beforeflawed errors in face, sky and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unblurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digiplug; tool refocate refocus on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to use copyrighted protected filter-algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to explain a photo to & quot; refocused on the photo. this is better to sharpening the photo. refocussing usually better results than blurred masking. you can start refocus from the menu by calling colours refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw is much better than the palate's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, depending on which the mathematical result is far from the original pixels, which is far influenced by remote pixels, which causes unwanted results in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should place 1 good results when your image is very unsharp, but if your image is very unsharp.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation can help increase artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the shielding effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters: increasing the space filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are generally helpful. however, the image value is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality very badly. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will still increase the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arartefacts. in most cases, you should increase this value to 0, so you may also increase the correlation and / odershness filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformer size. however, an increase in matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameters will be stored for you later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, colour and intrusion gractures on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture. the reason is that much surgeries changes are not visible immediately, but later left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading images and compress, & eg; to JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred massively produces better results than sharpening. this might be causing unsharp masking a bigger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of unbelief. for the Viennese filter it is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the automotive focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methodological structure in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knobs glasses set the sharpness of the range of the darker to generate a more natural clupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows the fitting color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools designed to remove the artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">This algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preadjustments for starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab glasses and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail-keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to an even smoothing about the image. what is needed for greater values mainly homogeneous regions and details. a value of 0.9 should be required. please note that the details should always be subject to accuracy dependence.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction-dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film-like or CCD smokers will produce a high value of wavy-like patterns. JPEG artifacts will be removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p defines the relative smoothing. set this value therefore to the degree of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. this is necessary if a lot of space is higher when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is running. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-wide da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen, then you should also choose a long runtime, so you should choose this value as much as possible and unacceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated stepper span [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel glasses and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the More "quality that you can get by dialing this option is only low. however, it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow him to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of image errors can be corrected and loaded into a text file later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast when working. however, it can last very long and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with button termination.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are removed with small artifacts. the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">Digitization; Robust is a very powerful tool to decrease image exchange. it uses a protected algorithm created by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selected image filters to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair to the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need additional information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in this tutorial in English.</seg>
<seg id="533">The image above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained crafty that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you need only the lower window details and the lower window settings can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is required for the filter. large values increase the time of the filter by the radius and the colour in it is smoothes and thus adjusted smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the switching distance. this value uses the pixel pitch the filter trap forward. if it is increased, the adaptive filters can be re-adjusted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer get more or crack or dirt.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, you can't remove the entire noise or crack at a value, if you want to remove a weak room or JPEG artifacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the light emitting olerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve the picture. these settings don't influence the smoother process by using the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve the picture. these settings don't influence the smoother process by using the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammate olerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark zones that are typically stronger, however, it also polishes the shadow zones.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the adjustment of phasenjitterdamping. this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is higher, the edges can appear on a minimum, can remove robbery and phasenjitter on the edges. it can remove robbery and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for the saving, which you have set, can be saved in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how to change your life how to change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected sum (2) is used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture to crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw a little bit softly. use tool to correct softness with the menu entry. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitites; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to drop into digital, original or subsequent digitalized pictures; the smoothing occurs along the picture contours and thereby maintains the content as it also makes human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for paint- and textual design. algorithm for restoration is performed using a different tool, the image error correction was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / FrannkreI and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifact reduces the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas, it produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are visible in uncompressed picture. this setting should be correct.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later reloading.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast to work. however, it can last very long and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with button end.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with a shaped crawling can be restored.. The module is applied to a Black and white photo using a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous filmstrip on the faces. the original image is below (1) and that corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Here, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures can be read on an old color photo taken with a scanner. the scan artefacts have been shown by scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove all photos with a CCD camera, eight were used. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickens.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are a problem especially when many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the assistant with button dark. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you capture the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the right dark-image to the correct image. please note that the wizard will notice the last dark screen and automatically charges it automatically in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you corrected the outcome. the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all prefabricated areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Dursection: an average of the neighboring pixels is determined. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional Interpolation, this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block, are moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these will then be used to interpolate the defective pixels in the bloc.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixel's block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the bloc.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel-correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Digitization: the digiplug is a tool to correct the votation, i.e. underexposed corners that correct the image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in mid-sized and large photo format, can not easily illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) it can reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there. telezing will also demonstrate this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle objects, also with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less otherwise, otherwise unsharpening effects are created.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's filters and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation into an image that was done without this filter. the tool is protected by a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the supporter-correction filter and with three further coating of the finish picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the level of light bulbs at the point of the highest density. the standard density is 2.0, or randomly compensate the density to compensate a greater degree of veling. reduce it to compensate for a little degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Lamp thickness, contrast and gamma-settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignettilt-correction reduces the layer thickness of the pixels with these options. the knob points you only need positive values when you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to create a fine readjustment of the target screen, the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the digiplug; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the votting correct correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the image processing in the corners and (2) the correct image and contrast correction was also carried out with the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug; linear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses to photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient is the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or contrasting form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but it is applied to the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of magnitude corrected the remote corner to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second gradient. with negative values, tonnensic distortions can be corrected and positive values are distortive distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree. this value affects stronger than in the center as in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'vertices parameter set the parameter of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value shows the image size and thereby leads to the correction of first gradient. negative values improve positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners to increase positive values.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog box with a preview of the distortion correct. the values which you can use for your picture will be stored and used at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or pillowly correction should be carried out prior to any concision or size changes. if you're making a picture new. if you're making a picture new and then a tonnenular correction would be the effect of the folding.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you make the best correction to provide you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place. in connection, you can correct the tonnen- / pillow distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct distortive distortion, the resulting image black edges will be correct. you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or the zoom controller of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tonnenshaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for a few motifs such as photos from the front, frame and paintings. note that if you keep the camera with the hand, you will always keep a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnensic correction to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of Gimpguru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">On the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can see the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can adjust two parameters set filmstrip and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the grained texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator is changing the amount of film production and the dominance of the color green (Chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colour channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green canal makes it any sense to use the effect on black / white photos, because the colour information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter material used on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the illustrated picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the Svalleys.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digiplug; filter film production is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film trays on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films mix the manufacturers big silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The filmstrip effect returns to your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past. in case you want to get a timeless atmosphere of daily life. if you want this special, gallery-like, road photography, gracious views especially in your monochrome photos, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated for the control of the intensity and granularity of the grains. although higher values are required, if you need more grats, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the filmstrip effect on a black / W photo. the original image is the (1) and the processed (2). the used film sensitivity complies with ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digiplug; filter oil paintings produced the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitiff; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and style are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs in order to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better for large images. smooth or, from the other side looks like, the scarlet.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and it is marked with (2). pin size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digiplug; filter coal drawing has been used for colour and intensity gradients to produce a cabeskizze. images of their gradient is very helpful for this effect. if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline what scene you would have to outline. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjust contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of carbon label filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; filter engraving imshapes your image in 3-D when it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected algorithm created by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digiplug; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure, where color is not the most important at the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, mondarful landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork with distortion effects. it uses the protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavelength 1: divides the picture in cells and it can look like if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wavelength 2: analog to the wavelength 1 is distorted in a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time for calculating and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with button end.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by using the sharpness effects. it uses the protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom lens: wiped out the picture along sterned lines that go from a central point. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial incontexhaustion: the image by rotating the pixels around a center. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Range of range: wiping the image to create a non-focused camera channel. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of motion: wiping the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the impotence of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or pull photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft disastness: wipes the image softly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dream and glossy soft focusing effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portrait, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Bulk data: wiping the image by random shifting of pixels and simulates the inconsistency of a arbitrary stooping camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent disorder: finds the colour in the image and doesn't know this without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need long time for calculating and cause a high CPU load. this calculation can therefore be cancelled anytime with button end.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice little tool to make regentropping on your picture. this gives it natural your pictures a nighappearance. it uses an copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allowed to change the size of drips. because the size of the image is not automatically reduced with the size of the image. number changes the number and density of drops. fish augen changes the optical effects of the drops in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the digiplug; image processing a range of free from raindrops. use the option to select the range, e.g. a face that should be free, if you start the filter drops, the area should be free from regentropping.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the drops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, so you can bring it through chips or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformers Turning or Transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to enlarge is simple. the big question is, how can you find an image bubbles and the details? how can you find the missing information? how can you find the missing information? how can you find the missing information? how can you find a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a picture has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transformers size in the menu and enter target values. the dialog is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size is using linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool for inflatable.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs are using interpolation, e.g. split interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug; used by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France, and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio maintained: if this setting is activated, when entering the new size, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. this is necessary if a lot of space is higher when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons save as and loading are used exactly. each entry for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast with what it makes it, but it may last very long and draw a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with button end.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by adding a small colour image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not just a common operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. the image processing is simply simply possible to create a picture with mouse, by pressing the mouse button and draw the cheques. you will see this rectangle below while you move your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut out. by doing so, you can change the size of this area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle, simply create a new rectangle with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you're satisfied with the cutting machine, use button 1 button on the toolbar and the picture is trimmed (Ctrl + + X). use the entries File Save or File Save In the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In preview area you can change the size of the cheques by sliding the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you will remain in dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool as aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio is used a relative aspect ratio. this means that it always is equal, regardless of whether you are centimetres, inch or any other physical size. you can see e.g. a list of traditional sizes for photophiier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons for the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the range to the maximum possible, depending on selected relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool as a aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool, these settings will be displayed as default values in the EXIF tables, so that EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "" "" "the settings of the compositions help allow help to assemble your images better. those help include:" ""</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like third-party gel, harmonic triangles is a way to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Mitte: the golden middle is a spacing to various natural growth markets like the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the aperture leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is used by the Irrational number 1.618033988... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians, and also used to construct the golden pitch in all times if you're using your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number after 1 is equal to 1: 1.618 the golden middle. the resulting divider is as follows a visually harmonically.</seg>
<seg id="654">The gold centre provides liquefied auxiliary lines if you incorporate a picture. these assists are being exposed down below:</seg>
<seg id="655">Golden Spirale is able to achieve good results for your photos. compared to third-party gel, the Golden Spirale provides a smooth line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule, the rectangles of the golden coil, also called golden rectangles. it should give something that the eye can be placed in the heart of the composition. this may simply be a line or different objects. this may be just as being without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles also derive from the above mentioned golden coil. its vertex points are the middle points of the pages of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles can't place any equered object. diagonal to these lines can have a statical object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles for your frame, create a effect of professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition, which you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">Options horizontal and vertical bars can be used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button colour, you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines may be invisible. this type enables you to adjust the colour of lines to your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool for turning a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens slightly, that's not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things get a angle. you can repair it with & digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the button settings you can set the slider on the right side of the window. the new dimension of the picture will be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">At your help the Module Freie Rotation is available for horizontal and vertical line. after positioning the mouse pointers in the image preview, you can fix it on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle to the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture, you'll find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function transformation process using image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic feeding. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smooths the image a bit after turning. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All peroxidative transformations are carried out by a fixing point to the so-called reference point. this point is presented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. preview will then be created automatically. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information which can help you alter the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas which are produced by transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas which are produced by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture is a bit contaminated. for individual adjustment is this effect small but two customizations create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you've missed the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. a way to bersome is the image to cut out from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module using transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Drive your picture by using the Horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you push the settings, the angle is displayed on zero. a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you will navigate a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the mouse button to fix the lines. you can now adjust the mouse button to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out, the image will have a bit wisely. for a single lift, this effect is usually negligible, but two chings are thus doubly smashing and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After crossing the image unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove this is the image using transformers cutting from the image processing.</seg>

<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your RAW files stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF, or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw von Dave Coffin. an original quote from Dave Coffin is not that it generates the same results, like the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results!</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file to convert and launch the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image. you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the most important parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera has been operating in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and select the Convergence result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all information about your image and use the loss-free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you frequently use your images frequently or later, you should not use JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations before image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG formats, the metadata file contained in the JPEG file are stored in the JPEG file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the button to start the conversion process. if you want to break this process, you can use this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to one time. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, they have been able to overwrite the existing file automatically. that's helpful if this is created in an earlier attempt. a look is not available as far as conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of a album. you can set up the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several pictures of an image collection. you can reduce the image using ImageMagick package. they can be reduced or enlarge the image of the image change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image will be selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo printer. the target pattern, including background size, random size and background colour, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your favorite e-mail program. it's also possible to change the size of the images in advance. more images can be taken on the list of these images here.</seg>
<seg id="873">After having started the module, the pictures will be displayed by you on selected images. you can add a look at a file selection dialog. for the latest image, you can see a preview of the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the picture list and add there to add the list of these images.</seg>

<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail clients. you just need to add the addresses and the header to the subject. photos are attached to you as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't hesitate to send a lot of images on once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is saved and any time used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path to your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you need to install the GMailagent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file the comments will be added to the images in a text file and provided the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG Format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you choose to JPEG file format and select the original files in JPEG format, the original exibfdata will be added to sensuing images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is done automatically, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can view the status messages, on the search for errors that can be seen automatically at the end. by pressing the button, you can get this window wilie? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module's advanced Diashau, there will be a window with questions such as you want your diaschau. you can choose between the selected and all the images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation are used to use very elegant lines via OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the Diaschau will be very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option ensures that the filename of images are displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop allows for this to display the presentation in an endless loop. it can be manually disrupted by Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option randomly choose images that the images are displayed in random order, so it will not be used in the sequence of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transitional effect. you should let this be the presentation to show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly selects any other effect between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diashau you can access a toolbar at the upper left of the screen. move your mouse into this corner to shift you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can stop the presentation and start again, jump back to the previous and next picture and stop the slides.</seg>

<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same icon in front of her name. you can store with & kid album; however, for every person a private preview image, this also applies to places, words and other categories, which you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display pictures from the name, select the button on the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category separately. you can view the view for each category separately (if you have no suitable pictures for your keyword).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must specify that image for each individual person will be displayed. in order to see the image-safer window (in closer look) and select the image for the appropriate person. in the view window you can choose the magnification factor according to your requirements, which part of the image will be displayed and cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">When searching for the entry in the main window, a dialog is displayed, which is very similar for the celebration of the image characteristics. this dialogue can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a character in the label or description, the captions and descriptions of the pictures will be searched for this text; the date may be either part of the complete date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data as for example 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the image, but where Jesper, but not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kid album; if you don't like to read manuals, rather like functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and look at the quick release, the screens and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kid album; and in the first dialogue the Demo, if you start & kid album; for the first time, or select a menu entry into the menu entry. then, you can download some sample images and you can test the functions of & kphotoalbums.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a program HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the Main window of & kphotoalbum; see the time bar. a picture of this bar can be seen here: as the name already says, this Easy tells you date information about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time bar can display several different time units. each bar displays a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture, you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute intervals.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar can be interactive to the following modes: you can change the comments viewed from the database (if you select a date on the date displayed, the current date displayed on the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you want to navigate in preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button, and the mouse over the ruler's schedules, i.e., when you select a range, you'll notice the selection, by clicking on a log of time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kid album; presents two ways to create HTML pages with your images. it is available in & kphotoalbums; integrated and the other as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the following version is described, which you can create file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you'll need to set some settings. these are divided into three areas of contents, layout and target. in the following, each area will be described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the folder and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photorecord, HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & kid album; the export file should be created on the review page. next to import information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information is displayed on HTML pages. for example, you can avoid that information is displayed by a party. for example, you can't use any pictures without description. you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like this. most importantly, which is not specifically addressed to this.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below you can set different resolutions on the images. you need to view those who have a monitor and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no images that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time. so, he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if a picture is larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this area, insert the various folders and URL, where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a basic folder for all your HTML files and select a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved. this folder will be automatically added to the location. this folder allows you to select either a folder or from KDE supporting protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can verify that this really all for viewers can choose a web browser after the pages have been created, launched. the URL, which you should click here. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created you don't have to copy them in the final destination folder, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files, but the basic folder in which all subfolder will be found.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described only have to refer to all three on basic folders or URLs. in these, a sub-folder will create, whose name is set in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you come to a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbums; you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images. if you're already quite a lot of time, you'll need to add a HTML page for viewing, then you must do with & kid album; this work did not make even more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kid album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import them to your database. the image features are expressing and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they distinguish themselves whether images can be stored in the file or if you have any pictures in the file. the obvious drawback is, however, the file size is file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can select a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or, together with HTML pages, see, create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">One external .kim file searches the images on two-fold ways. first, the images are found in the folder of .kim file. the images of the URL, which you have created when creating HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images are described, which you can export via the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether to deal with internal or external .kim files, there are the following three selection options:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you select the .kim file, you have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically, copy and copy the .kim file, copy & kid album; pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, if you want to compress the files, so simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum picture size limit. if you send your friends images, you would not want to limit your images, as the .kim file would be very large. here you can tell the size that each picture should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file using the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File file Import... select & kid album; exporting database as described in detail.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing consists of four steps. first, you must select what pictures you want to import, then into which folder to import images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you can personell the category people to import file (if you are a Dane), while this category is necessary for your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialog box, which categories the categories of imported file are to be imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can select the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and watch images: if you see images, you often want to watch images from different picture sets & mdash; if you see images of your Italy vacation, you might want to see images on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the various steps from (1) to place the information about your images, through (2) to browse and pass through (3) Advanced topics and adaptable possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">Photo album has been started as a program to manage your images. however, it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual, it also includes pictures, but often includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kid album; stores all his information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of its images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal locking tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kid album; noticed the folder where your images are stored automatically and used this in future Starts. if you want to start another folder with pictures, you can start a different folder with pictures, you can start & kid album; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbums -c ~ / company / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Using the Settings menu entry into photoalbums; set up to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbums; please refer to the various setup possibilities in the following section of the user manual.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can access the preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, you can view a detailed help to call the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how you can set various properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog box that is used to process already existing groups. you can select a label and select a symbol for each existing group.</seg>
<seg id="955">Sub-categories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete membership groups, e.g. all members of a group met once in a group instead of all groups of one centre.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the installation options that are available to you to the fixed list of members. in the left window you can configure the category. in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotorecord; share its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digitiam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin interface. next information you will find on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called on the module modules. they are not described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbums; but most modules have a help-page, which you can access via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together among others, the modules can be tested with & kphotoalbums; therefore, you should always test new modules with the command database before using the command &gt; kphotoalbums-demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. don't say, I would not have warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kid album; not work. this is the downside if you divide functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbums; and other applications that are using KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported by albums: this kind of order is not supported, simulates the order for albums, so you can use the functions with & kphotoalbums;</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kid album; the current album that's just corresponds to the current view, i.e. all images that show you the picture-picture.</seg>
<seg id="963">Along with the current album & kphotoalbums; modules can also be delivered a list of albums. here is & photorecord; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photoalbums; s browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set as a category for virtual albums, i.e., for example, using the category people, will be used & kphotoalbums; so whether you would have chosen persons to view and pass the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kid album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. launch the modules section and choose which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a startling screen as soon as you start & kid album; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, see the window below and see the toolbar. under the toolbar you can see your picture database. in the section, we will not read more information about your images. in this section, please click on the entry images that shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kid album; is the possibility to watch any image with notes on the picture, where the image has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of images in particular. if, for example on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all images taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes may be used for searching and browsers as you can read in the section. if you want to see this comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text field by giving people, places and keyword. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you can always use them when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the move of images within the list: if you have shown a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons can be depicted, so that the names used are shifted to the top, which can be quicker and assigned.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer a alphabetical list of the list, click the icon for sorting by the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have any comments to each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and have these images with notes. Click on the right and back buttons that are located under the picture of the picture on the top.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries to once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and California are all in the USA. Moreover, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a group. to view it, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Anodungsdialogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new overcategory. additionally, you can also move an entry in this entry to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this requires you to alphabetically sorted your categories.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the feature dialogs by forming the bodies that form the edge of the frame, click and move them. you can also move your own window by taking it outside the window range.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the window look at your needs to be satisfied with the settings, click on button Options... which offers you the possibility to save the current design and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely. if you want to display this window later, use the button Options... and here window can be a / out. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you will find an overview with preview images of currently selected images, or all images, if you do not have a filter. here you can see the size of previews, by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave a painting on the background of your desktop, this image will be furnished as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is shown in the image viewer. if you don't have a window with a view, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image show. simply delete the appropriate images or select either the Edit menu or select from the Edit menu. now the window will be displayed, which you can see in the image.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kid album; allows you to have a solution for this problem. you can also use with & kid album; namely, images can also be saved anywhere, so & kphotorecord. in the image, you'll see the view of & kphotoalbums; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. for example, you can see images on the images 1-9, but you can see the preview of these pictures, however, you can't view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, you need this function that you want to copy files from folders and do it again. if you want to avoid offsetting of the concerned CD. if you want to avoid offsetting of the concerned CD, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu Images you can find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you would like to have a little more privacy, you can view the images in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can view all the pictures depicting your little sister, and choose the menu entry everything except above view.</seg>
<seg id="990">Thus, you have set out what pictures will be hidden in case of the case. if you want to lock the laptop for your little sister. if you want to unlocked the menu entry, if you want to get blocked, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered for unlock the images. in order to set up this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is not very safe. you can read all images on the hard disk and to others, who can read password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are associated with & kphotoalbums; not very familiar, the view on private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you would like to spend all your pictures with & kid album; manage and store hours over hours, of course, that you want to look at sometime. for this reason, & scores. this is a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows the picture, but additional information you have shown on the picture, like who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox on the top part of the picture you want to see, so you can configure this simple with mouse and what else can be displayed. all these options are displayed by a right-click on the viewer. so, you can see the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, see the matching entries for this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures from Anne Helene. when you chose Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have downloaded several images in the viewer, you can transfer between them and follow the buttons picture high and image. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run this as Diaschau. & kphotoalbums, then load a new picture after a few seconds. how frequently a new picture can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus respectively Minus. start and stopped by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful capability of the viewer's viewer & photoalbum; it is used to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>

<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see images on paper. to see what pictures you want to start with the pictures and get them as good or bad, while you can watch one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to get pictures with features, while they look at. features are the letters A-Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters. in view of the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have further features on your images, you can see them in your browser. if you have any pictures, print or whatever you have. this is described here. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want.</seg>

<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire model views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also choose several objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all sub-objects are already selected using the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select menu entry in the menu.</seg>

<seg id="1042">If a picture is reduced with just one beam ever, there are various errors. these images are often displayed a Moirè pattern or level effects in curves and lines, but sometimes details are displayed in representation smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of that error. in general, pictures with this property better look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the second method is adaptive, non-recursive method; adapted for the second method is adaptive-recursively; because each pixel is constantly growing and adapted because each pixel depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray has given a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values are processed, both pixels are calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you specify the depth of 4x4 additional points, a grid value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional radiance per pixel are calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predetermined threshold, the pixels will be divided into 4 sub-pixel which can be examined individually and on further subdivision, you can adjust the maximum depth of the rectal.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the Aliasing effect is called jittering, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changed & Povray; the Rays to avoid a tiny amount to prevent regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can adjust if the alpha-channels are calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not taken any object.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values result in more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can set up the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross extended projections for extended projections, all wire model screens are further divided, all projections are used with exceptions the perspective and perpendictory projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>

<seg id="1077">So you just have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to create more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should very popular but very popular: a ball at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings, before you complain that as a result, you should only use a black screen. if you are using a 3D program, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you cannot set a camera, no rules for the rendering can be applied as result, a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">When you insert a light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window rules:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation, so you can expect an appropriate presentation of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">They are often used to use these menus and symbols, therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and its application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree. highlight the scene and then select a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene. in particular, they are in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this is the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the contents of view object properties that find the different parameters of the camera. in the user documentation about & Povray; please find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing about the basic settings of the camera, this is a later instructions to change, but note that the camera in the view control points you can change the target point of the camera. simply click the right button and draw it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button user or input, the wire-model views and the object tree will immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene. you could set a quader (insertion of fader body quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a thorough method for resolving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; indeed, it provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button. in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now indicates the level even though at the moment only as a limited level. if you renders the scene, the level extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can view the object tree on the floor, you'll notice the default options for each new object: scaling, turning and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just move some of these parameters. select different parameters and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First, choose the ground in order to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a bit impress at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog box opens in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted as object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground-pigment), with one click on the button below you can see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course shows the preview of the Pigments just a matte black material, because you can always send settings for the pigment. do you always think you can see the look of materials anytime with one click on preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on quader and ball, click the button and then call the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is right now. if you have the image now with one click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the colour. you need further settings necessary. in the colour list you have to set two new attributes, called the entry menu. then you can do this entry twice (you can also do more frequently, but the box checklist can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select and change the colours in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you be able to run, as you have understood the basic mode of & kpovmodeler; you can already understand the sphere just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the values for the radius (please don't forget to push the input or press the button. otherwise, the ball would be boiled over the ground as you have shifted the ground to move down a unit.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, Rendering is to see a strange result: as previously, the ball surface appears as a matt black material. put a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now show a material now. as in the ground, enter the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose the bottom object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. Click on sphere pigment, then select Unicolored and ask the Values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take time to hire some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screens and click on the user or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection result already produces good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression that features you & kpovmodeler; hopefully, you've already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to generate a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the Renderer hypothetical Rays (i.e. from the camera, which reflects the scenes) through each pixel's perspective, and how atmospheric effects of light sources is reflected in the scene, and how atmospheric effects will result in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye when you see the scene. without a light source, you can see the picture. obviously, every scene is to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. POVRAY files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>

<seg id="1125">A bump-map is an option to modulate rough surfaces without changing any diffusion on the surface, without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models will then be machined to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel-based on the application of an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picking and browser. the application has a file browser that allows you to display pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the & LMBn; or the return Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether each image will be displayed in a separate window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first sign of the filename in the browser window. if a matching file name has been found, the file will appear. you can leave the input field using Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarook only requires the kdelibs package and otherwise no further KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs so installed (including the programs contained therein, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to get kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD is ahead, that your window manager will work the relevant standards of freedesktop.org, i.e., fluxbox will work for example. we try to use Amarook on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>

<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar is a search filter. it stops in the list view as well as in the tree view. references to the use of this filter you'll find in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection box where you can filter the latest addition to your collection, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year. also, you can also select your overall collection, which makes the filter practical.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Loading - This is the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid sequence in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double clicking on an entry, you can reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This feature adds the selected pieces into the queue. this will be played as next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as playlist... - location the selected pieces as playlist. you will be asked after a name, under which the list should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">On Media Player - Lead the pieces into the queue for transferring on the media player. more details can be found in the section on the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this interpreter burn / on CD - Daddy will be sent to K3b and burn either as data or as audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... open the dialog for pieces information and you can change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>

<seg id="1377">Select a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, it appears among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Compilation marking - Change a compilation of selected album back into a normal album. the album is then not displayed by different interpreters but again under the associated interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browsers specifically designed to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. this use & Amarook; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: playlist with the pieces in your collection that never were played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even Intelligent playlists were also possible. Click on Intelligent playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Intelligent playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The lower window media player is used for the connection of & Amarook; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarook; for example, it must be done before the start of & Amarook; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok, you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpret. at the top listing of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and leave them on the list interpret. if you're finished, click on overload. if the transmission is finished, finish & Amarok; and solve the drive connections for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area where you can search for a file. search is particularly useful because in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hatched, which meet not your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you can get an address bar, where you can insert music from an inserted URL, you can download music in the music file of musi.tar.gz. you can now drag and drop the music from there into playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">When the playlist is longer than in the window, the trailer of files can be helpful. in the case, the hold of the Shift may be helpful. in this case, fjuly files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all of you to play-playing pieces. you can change the order by simply drag the entries and drop into a text box. once you enter a filter by clicking here, press the characters. in order to reset the letters, press the button again until the text box is empty.</seg>
<seg id="1389">When you enter spaces separate search terms, & Amarook, search for entries, which contain all search options. if you have two three entries, search will find all entries, one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">When you enter between the search terms, you are looking for entries either to either one or the other keyword. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all the songs will contain one or two or three (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries, select the spaces, then select the keyword with goose-feet: Mike Oldfield. this way, Mike Oldfield is looking for entries, but not on entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search engine, you can also look for larger or smaller. for example: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher average score than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece, don't contain a certain search term, set a Minus sign in front of the search keyword: -somewhat searches for pieces, which do not contain.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations after each other. example: Mike Oldfield OR core: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this is searching for all pieces that have either Mike Oldfield or having a higher average score than 50 and do not include a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can hold the playlist of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then click on the right button in the desired order. the entries will then get a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom edge of the window. you can add buttons for some functions of playlist. on the left side you will find the playlist, save playlist, refresh and random mixing.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons follow the back and restoring. thus, you can make changes to the playlist or restore.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& K3b; is how many other & kde; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface equipped. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; -functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are important in the functional range, therefore, the type of your task is decideable, which gives you access to the programmes.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we'll use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; you have to make sure you need to make sure & K3b; then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; -programming, supports & K3b; mainly two other parts are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface of & K3b; provides functions such as copyrights, informatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result such a createXXXProject method, one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # K3b _ audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject Through using this reference is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>

<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on your computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, convert these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or other formats like the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading & CD;, by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia uses; almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed. all these programs are usually not required for any Linux distributions, but if FLAC is not used, if FLAC is not used, the installation is not required.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While mounting only once must be done (the setup dialog, however, it is often called up to a suitable configuration), afterwards the daily handling of a & CD; this leads (hopefully) will be explained for the streamlined approach of user interface, which you often can stumble at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, codiers and compression rates and helps you choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are also other like 'shorts' or 'monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats used by data compression, MP3 and OGG files are the most common. OGG may today have an easy advantage towards MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), however, the differences become less important because both codiers generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, advertising is provided with most distributions free, but there are open license questions</seg>

<seg id="1518">MP3 - when music is also heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - beginning 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable visibility for most people and most musical pieces acceptable visibility, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate for 5.5. requires some older devices. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for music from adolescents, portable devices and car output devices. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want the absolute highest quality without consideration to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; Information that can be entered manually from FreeDB program automatically as a list of parameters. you can pass / used in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create folders and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codiers, there are often a combination of program settings for the codiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the codiers explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles to the keyword (english: day) if MP3s can be encoded using lame and the title Parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks so out: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button number in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the FreeDB is: a free database in which people can read / enter the audio CDs instead of which all the other information can be entered into the calculator below: & CD; titles, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not a lawyer. however, it is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent it from the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither can artists have any damage to the music or CD; any information can be obtained from a bummel through a & CD; business, physically or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; it is active in a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it appears to be used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears that the e-mail address will not be used for retrieving the data from the server (This may only know the programmer.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many different countries copies from the main database. if & kaudiocreator; for use of FreeDB, the geographical on the subsequent mirror server will be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually only monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What kind of reading is used to store pieces from the & CD; into WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used, searching in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the compressed WAV files, the encoding and file format can be chosen. when opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) can be added to the tab. other codiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codiers package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the codiers can be used. this is also necessary for predefined codiers. more information about Kodierer are located in the chapter Welker Counter.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codiers, additional information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many reasons. check out the device's device, writing and reading, whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio codiers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are trying to access both programs with a command line in one terminal.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, but all are understood somehow? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time and read all our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You have to install cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, since it is considered non-free software. anyway, it's not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to have (eg; to try to copy something with the Conqueror something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers basic setup of & kaudiocreator; what is thought to presumably be done, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what to be repeating & CD; must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the reusable codiers for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we faul we will share the program that use FreeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings, we will probably not change at any reading & CD, if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device number will be handed over to the readable program that can read & CD data / items.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often, / dev / cdrom exists a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive. if it does not work or if more than a & CD / DVD drive can be accessed, so a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to perform existing records of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The cartridge card General Settings. here's not much to do. here, an additional conversion will be defined. in our example, everything will be exposed as shown in the screenshot that is shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only For incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information about the generating of keyword (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The cartridge card CD; -Settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD can be downloaded automatically via the internet of a FreeDB calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected during the reading & CD; it can be connected to the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you are unsatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries, you can easily change. the directory / file name is changed using box - &gt; renaming and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you wish to enter manually, if you want to manually enter the database, if you want to use FreeDB in the offline mode, however, this is worth considering whether the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first selection fields will be set at least the following box card is set up.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is available for us FreeDB. these are settings for data inquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from FreeDB server to the Internet. how to get the system which should get the CD? read the section on FreeDB, as shown in the screenshot of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your nearness. on this way, the load will be distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both do both work on the server, as many Firewalls will boot the protocol 8880 standard, perhaps more luck with the 80, because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data on the FreeDB server will enable you to disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot of the screen. (do they make sure the folder / tmp is running on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously connected pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one when using existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, so easy to try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check it around the & CD; cast off at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you cross this cross, then / must be stored in which WAV files can be stored in which the files are stored in a private folder where you don't forget to do this folder when you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">To set everything as it is on the screen. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances, something must be tilted to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned above, it is sufficient for very good audio-quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. it's a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the creation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screen. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously codizing WAV files: if a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's what we've just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, as described above the process of reading & CD; we will create MP3 files. first, we will create MP3 files. first, we get a connection to the Internet since we get comfortable and the & CD; data from FreeDB, must be described in this section, must be repeated for any interpreting & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not included in FreeDB file, the screens therefore have a bit different from FreeDB file. therefore, you will learn how to retrieve the & CD; data can be manually transferred to the Internet instead of using FreeDB. comments will be submitted to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, then the & CD has to be defined in the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screen, this only if the & CD has been identified as audio CD; it could be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then check in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD could be picked up by FreeDB, all the tracks of the pieces are completed and the name of the artist and album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that there's more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD, and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best suited to your & CD; fits in your opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic FreeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for Settings), you can manually remove this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the titles of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen, the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Aktuell title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist doesn't need to be entered in the "Update Field ', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for individual comments inidiles per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments on the CD's pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of data from FreeDB, the CD Editor is not empty, but it's always contains the data as shown in the following image file (e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limit the length of the fields to 30 characters for the commentary volume. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the encoding tab. take a look at the tab Settings section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. you will see in the help to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of the reconnaissance CD; this is not important because we don't transmit the & CD-data. for more information, please go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example, can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors are back and you see that the fields are already filled with the submitted data, which we have recorded for the first piece. enter the items for the current piece. enter the title of the piece in any case and any other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way up to all the cover data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear when you have downloaded the FreeDB file. it is already sorted into one of these categories.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the denominations.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before every line of a piece. just the titles are selected. just a simple click on the line switches to select all the tracks are selected, or use the button all tracks to choose from the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection, read the read process, this window appears to confirm. on OK, then we will take a look at the window with orders and track what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears if you're trying to work with a codierer you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully cocoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example. did you test write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it's finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and encode parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration settings to read and encode this behavior. the number of parallel processes can be read and encoded. for powerful tools, the machine used with a AMD64 appears no problem at simultaneous interpreting and encode (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while a different piece is coded, and a third order in the queue's queue stands. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & kde; 3.5mm and 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the codierer of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; it is now entertained within the & kde; CVS, as part of the endemic media package, however, you can already get a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; -package is. if you read it, you've probably already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to persons who are compiled by source files and not intended for users who use a precompiled package of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for assistance such as the program can be adapted to your needs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs, has many variations on settings. best read the step by step example to know the options and settings. it displays screens of different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, always read on? even if only the Help menu has been clicked, without any attraction, like it is going to pass on this somehow empty screen (above all if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can't hold this handbook. it's the first version for a manual of & kaudiocreator; who, if you would like to add or modify this section, and if you should read this section and agree with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the File file. it appears the usual file dialog, which allows you to select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window to the & kmid; -window also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button finish in the toolbar, select the entry menu from the menu item or reuse the space.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the & kmid; -window. (in several pieces, they will be added to a collection and then play together.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive it with the knob.</seg>

<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in one piece of music. some pieces use text file, other use lyrics and other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can configure what events will be displayed and even better: the erpillar-type is automatically determined that you need to manually set up a song, so that you will automatically select the Karaoke text. they still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a ereccable type, select from the menu settings the entries or lyrics. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you will summarize. this section will be found in this section as you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. here you will find in the menu collection under the point Organize.... click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set up the desired requirements in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">During the application, this collection will not be saved. concerns the things when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it needs to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add the button to add a song. in turn, it appears to select the file dialog, using the help you want to select the song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection, a piece when opening (using file opening or drag & drop) will automatically be added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatisch is not activated on the collection, when opening a piece the temporary collection will be activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence where the songs will be played in the songs. if you played the songs from the menu's sub-menu, the songs will be played in the sequence, as they added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you want to add or remove songs, or select random order in the menu, the order will be set.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu or push the button to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Preview button, the entry previous piece from the menu or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To clear a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button deleting.</seg>
<seg id="1651">Temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it doesn't matter because they are not saved when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events are translated into events that understands synthesizers.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI Map, which turns all events of the Type Change Patch to Bright Piano in events of the Type Change Patch to Trumpet and thus becoming a trumpet player, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need a MIDI-map because all soundcards are GM compatible (including AWE - and GUS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps. you have to edit the appropriate file from Hand (with your favorite directory).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that saves all necessary modifications for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. for this, however, any occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Fine PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "A further keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section will start (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches from General MIDI will be depicted on your specific keyboard. the general use looks like:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the Left Side is ignored. it is believed to change the GM patches in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all sounds which allows you to put this instrument to the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a defensive drum (e.g. with sound 60), you can connect a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which means the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (defensive), patch is 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the concept drum Patch of Patch, a different percussionist instrument (drum, cymbal, Maracas & etc;) is, and not one, at which the clay means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify as sounds on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like at PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to replicate tones on the parked-channel. take a look at the following keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section may be used to replicate some channels to others. if you want to connect the first and second channel, simply make this simple to CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following patterns:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is mapped on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option to use the keyword's name for this channel. if you're using the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the parked-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio can be multiplied, in which a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is used by the formula n * (r / 4096) and then just forwarded. the value 4096 is not used in the map file (no decimbalas).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM is going to play a keyboard that will play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a tone above. unfortunately, some keyboards to play two tones up to an octave. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you can click on Settings menu, point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole array of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these claviets you see which tones are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument at a particular channel. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to indicate the played tones. view in the Settings menu under the Point Channel: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed, which is played with a song. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. if you like to find a song to follow the text, you can make it down. to change the speed, use arrows to turn left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">An MIDI file is a file that contains information on how a piece of music must be played like a piece of music. it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody, & kmid; with a good synthesizer you need a similar sound quality. in addition, you can change a similar sound quality. in addition to a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; so that's because & kmid; without AWE support is compiled. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's Home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a full folder to a collection, but I have no pleasure to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore support & kmid; drag & drop. open the folder where you want to add to & konqueror; select all files from, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Enable you to add automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can convert the arrow button on the left from Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double-click the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop a & strike; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play an MIDI file) or I'm running a file, just change to the & konqueror; -window, change the file into the windows of & kmid; pull them out.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen a file only quickly, without adding it to a collection, turn the setting Automatically Add to Collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection of files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's say you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. access to the first file only. so, select the setting Automatically Add to Collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you discard to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I see these songs or I see the postcard, animated me, on & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to handle the preferred links below the bookmark bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, then you should use the category Daughty playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Naturally, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchical level. if you want an entry, his group and all its subsets will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and Daughty playlist can also be changed by direct edit of the XML configuration files. obviously, the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer, but can also be changed by application itself. simply click on a name of a category. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select from the menu select the playlist and select either the user mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All modifications are lost when the processor mode leave or leave another group without having the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author's & kmplayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and running can be deactivated by editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted simply.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate any other animation; the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / introver.xml and ~ / .kde / kmplayer / ecit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation when starting does not need to be short, it will automatically end to opening a different source. this would be disturbing, the user may end up a second time at the end-animation.</seg>
<seg id="1719">An easy example of a startup animation can be a favorite photos: & lt; Heir; & lt; Heir; & lt; Heir; & lt; / bodyshell; & lt; / bodyshell; & lt; / bodyshell; & lt; / bodyshell; & lt; / /; / bodyshell; & lt; / /; / scores; / etc. / s; are supported by a few examples of SMIL which are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here's the issue of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition within the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example how a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; can even be played the special field check for YouTube in playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages can replay the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime application / x-Shockwave flash can be specified in the setup dialog file of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; can be found in a console application and error messages concerning the load of the browser module library. if there is no errors, the backend edition is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus a given backend for a certain Mime-type is taken (of course only if this was determined), it must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon all OGG files have to be recovered:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmPlayer; can be downloaded from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be properly configured, the scanner can be used in the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog box is found under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. you should be found out of which one has to be chosen (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name has probably contains a DVB therein.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only work XVideo (probably this kind of playing video devices using Linux the only works). this is also supported only on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the video forlinux add-on for the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, the KMPlayer for the sources are used for different names. at the time of the emergence of these documentation, this dvdnavsource, automatic source, pipesource, tvscanners, tvsource, urlsource, vcdsource, and vedsource. when it activates, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there hints on how to make my CDROM drive more quiet if I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -e 8 / dev / cdrom exists as user root after mounting the device. it is absolutely secure that / dev / cdrom exists on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine is starting off only slowly, why has to be tested my CPU on their performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into several elements. & Latex; the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most beautiful and subtle element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [straight-free File (engl. D e V ice I ngFile)] was created, jumps & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the appropriate line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">One DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information like the font, and also other information such as the font is available from & tex; or & latex; there are many tools to view, conversion and printing of DVI; files for various systems and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using RÃ ¼ ckwaves, the elements of the DVI; file has been clicked on a element in the DVI; file the exact opposite is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & Latex; source text is clicked, the corresponding place in the DVI; -viewer is scanned.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used with multiple files. with a master document, the work is simplified with other embedded .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed (if there are no errors in source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File watch: in this mode, the DVI; file on Ã ¼ nderungenâ tingâ maintained - and it won't take a call from & eyepiece; after quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In view of the edit toolbar, the three grooves selects should be developed into the document. the first selection box has been developed for quick review of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... Serializable & Latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box further is to be included in articles such as tags, fucking notes or references. the veritable mosaic are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: using this command a name for a section, a picture or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified name (selection of selection).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation is displayed a selection list with literary entries. in & bibtex; files are necessary editors necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; and & bibtex; files are natural also in & kile; files are written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ Ã e is used for defining the font domain, which are set to the main text, the fucking notes etc., there are the following fonts for the author:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & crile; two selection centres are available on the editor: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and fixed settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The clamps after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font domain. the font is not set at the beginning, this also may take place in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the obtaining source code has been entered the & Latex; -source code must be compiled. the easiest way to this is the use of MenÃ ¼ s Building or the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compile. & ile; the storage will be automatically created.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Now, the compiling of the document should be sought after errors. when using quick construction should be created & eyepiece, this should not be started automatically. this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that will be treated differently than the rest document. the command\\ 'begin {environment},\\' and\\ end {environment},\\ 'and\\ end {environment} would be possible to have the end of the font inside the region.</seg>
<seg id="1781">These changes are only allowed within the environment (of\\ 'begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no justity (number) for these changes within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, rust print, short pressure, submissions, etc. these commands are either connected to the\\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is designed for a short pressure, until he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one sentence can be represented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: created a quotation in document. the quote begins with\\ 'begin {Quote} and ends with\\ end {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After writing the source text with the & latex; marking language, a step-by-step guide is now followed by a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in assistants a bit of text was written, some adaptations might be completed to better readability of the document. these should be a quote, a few places in fat and short pressure, and a poem for application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">As soon as the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor via editor-view or Ctrl E (with internal viewer). the window must be closed with an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can print or be converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and enjoy fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a world-sized file format (engl. D e V ice I nº). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for reading the readability of some drivers from the computer. there are many different types of the .dk output like printer, & PostScript; / PDF transformer, or computer screen TVs.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps are available as for the creation of the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed (in the viewer) (if the printer is correct).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar lighting the conversion of the DVI; file in other formats. once the DVI; file from the & Latex; source text has been created, the transformation into walled different formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search enables the direct jump from the Editor to the appropriate position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& crile; offers a corresponding setup for all & Latex; binary files. for this purpose only Modern should be used under settings...</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to qualify for the previews, the mouse line must be positioned in one line of the source text, and connect to previews. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; -viewer is done so.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; it is possible with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document of & kile; available in & eyepiece; as text editor can be set as text editor (Settings: Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should no errors occur when using quick construction of the & DVI; a bug may occur. should an error occur, this is displayed in the logging file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file is obstructed the error source in source code. in the editor you can always be used to appear on the error. in order to be clicked, the logged file must be clicked on the error in the logging file and jump; jump to incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to choose from the set template for the document. the default features are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">For selecting a blank document, a document may be written either by reason or the assistant for quick preparation of a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be saved, stored and loaded to simplify the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / Latex; file can be created or created a new file. & Cile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection from file template...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using file, some strings can be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Kile settings... General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know what strings of which variables will be replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering in a document class. typically, it will be used as well:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {premature}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and therewith by means of the commands in the editor. once the document has been prepared for the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, then the own template may be selected rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and searched it under described steps.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Edit type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to provide support for Markup- and scripts. you enable & quantaplus; for your simplicity and flexibility made of & quantaplus; a fast, user friendly & IDE; for WEBENTWICKLER, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbar. day files are handy, symbolily oriented bodies of image buttons (above the editing window), text and instructions faster in a document when a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be prepared periodically (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see details for transformation.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & 'ptionrc; and also toolbars. short, a & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featuresdialoges, the & quantaplus; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; itself. toolbars also contains a quick insertion of tags in a document without any danger of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are not available as folders. they contain only the & 'ptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder apply the name of the write-language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use other users a better look and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is shown in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur in one document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but otherwise nothing else can be found itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; one argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid for the type class class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. returns the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by & lt; text &gt; Day. that's an element of element element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describing the attribute of a tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. additionally, it contains no further Tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed, etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Gives the source of the source codes for the attributes in the tag editing dialog, and the attribute-tree attribute.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus is used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology is used within & quantaplus; it is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and methodology name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% day name%, this means the name of the latest tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that is grouped together into the elements of a list. it can only occur within one attribute of the attribute. it is a element-type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Puts the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog. this day can occur only once in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be available for each field in a dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; & lt; label &gt; Day). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Gives a list of elements that occur within the defined tags. this element is a only one element.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Gives a list of elements that end a day. this element is a only one element.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; Declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chased and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but attention to & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt;; particularly in elements such as & lt; Tooltype &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML files, the tools Dialog at the top of & quantaplus; windows start and check TagXMLA. a further dialogue will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, check only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; Element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the File Name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & 'ptionrc; file is very simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD edit DTD. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; it should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] Version = use = 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for every higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as Nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can set up action with settings... to be created. Click on New Action for the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button assigned to this action. with clicking the button user can be assigned a keyboard shortcut; with caffeine is the current keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be inserted a text in the detaiding settings and in execution of the action, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that will use or input (or parts of the document), the quick start-up dialog or the various See in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptst variable in command line, like sh% script.exe / scripts / apps / quanta / scripts in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file is removed / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the repository.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, there can be a script input from & quantaplus; in the selection box input can be determined which can be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected part of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to input, the output of the issuing application can be redirected. there are two types issue: normal output, to the default output, which may be done by default, which is set to the standard edition by selecting the drop-out issue:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">As soon as a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure it. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts to edit the Edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the day attributes and you plan their use, activate dialog "Open Day," if available, thus one input when using the promotion is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let us know before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the promotion is better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & kmenu;, graphic more programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size other.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that this will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a knob button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered as less, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least specify this symbol no & lt; ready to insert a message; -day in current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol, it must be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">If you select the folder where the stored symbol is set, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Assuming, you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be shared this to better overview by some Trenner to several groups. open the toolbar to adjust dialog for toolbars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the cutting tool (at the top left) for my tool. after selecting the element to add to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I'd like to add a quick way to access the querqueror preview. I will choose it and add to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note as the Trenner support the grouping. someone, who doesn't know my tool bar, could believe that the & Conqueror; knob the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by probating all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup in the right folder. after new XML does not exist, but your tool bar should be stored in the right folder, but watch their toolbar (s) if your tool bar will be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for normal users, add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language you like this chapter, how I describe a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; repository if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create a existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you have to revise the docrc file. we need to give you the first part we will handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # 2, tag1, day 2, day 3, day 3, tag3, day 1 = Inter1.html section 2 = Inter1.html day 1 = tags.html day 2 = tags.html day 3 = day 2,html day 3 = day 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">Section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference = Basic Reference = Basic syntax,... basic syntax = language.basic-synchrontax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows the subfolder to be found in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the shaking depth (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You note that the directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently, at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but attention to & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The summaries is the range of docrc file that is used for creating the context sensitive help. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context-Help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the Context List (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of isolated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to the $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc for local and global use. then create a folder like docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these well and worth are to be divided, send your docrc files to the & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by & quantaplus; -Community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; are you not alone. it is possible to share the separator resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">Resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else. at different places there is an email with email, like DTD DTD-package (DTEP) with email, in context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main Archive, where all other & quantaplus; users can download it and use only available when our team is used as a correct and easy-to-use contribution to what it guarantees a gpg / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their personal gpg key (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the case that you need several keys, you can continue reading multiple keys (URL preferences can remain empty), and click OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the menus DTD DTD DTD-package (DTEP), upload tool toolbar, and folder in context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource through examination of the integrity and Signification. in case of problems, it may be broken. if the integrity is given and the resource has been signed, a message appears with the specification of the Creator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, it is possible to work by a DTEP package. the preparation can be needed time-consuming, because hundreds of tag files can be needed automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Converting of a DTD. select the .dtd file with DTD-Beschreibung, which is to be used, then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quantum / dartp folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definiderline: the string that is in! DOCTYPE Day, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / Off e.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine-adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; following transformation The newly created & DTEP; adapted to the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are several key concepts. to understand these basic concepts, you must first make this fundamental concepts. this chapter refers to them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit is meant.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and projection-related. this distinction concerns a series of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; stored in common folder's structure, actions and patterns in the global tree to ensure that each in a multi-user environment is available.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that it can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special promotions specially for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder's folder, what is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editing window, the function blocks, the boxes with information and the toolbar. please suggest in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">In order to click to select a context menu with the right mouse button, to get a context menu with the current document entries, recharging, delete or upload the document, jump to an bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editors, lead to another context menu, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / insert), editing the word under the mouse pointing or open the file when using the string under the mouse pointing file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor, the toolbar will be shown. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want one day, e.g. & lt; in their document, then click on the symbol that provides the day. now they may add one day that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can insert several fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) enable it to navigate to & quantaplus; to navigate, they can open and pervert. in the representation with cardboard boxes are available for files, project, pattern templates, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool which provides & quantaplus; it displays all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project using right mouse click. actions as adding, removing, uploading, or delete files from the storage medium can be done using the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, all web site & etc; there are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category hangs by & quantaplus; global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more on templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the insert in Global, Local and Project. by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information to a script. via the right mouse button you can start to edit or send the script using the right button.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by links to a element of element, the cursor is set on the position of the element. by right-clicking a element opens a list of commands to navigation and check-up of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other architectural views. with it, manrapidly Attributes and namespaces will change the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is a complete documentation for web-technology for your development. you can create your documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site can be created, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cartaries on the lower end of the window can be achieved using the beneficial information: the news window and the problem windows.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cardboard box shows information on any quantum-running script. for example, the DTD uses the current document and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, specify all error messages (so that there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolates is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with email; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar-Archive about & kmail; when you get a toolbar in an email; it can secure them in & quantaplus; as any other guarantee and charge!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; files to your system wish. in order to receive a complete list of options, enter the configure script. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not implemented here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path has the & kde; 3 bin folders. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is in front of their bin folders. it is the same applies to & Qt;</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a well-engineered development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML; Editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a close-up idea; now, this would make him an absolutely amazing web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now it is enclosed on the way to a general and comprehensive Web Development Toolbox: if you can define it in & XML; then you should be & quantaplus; it should be the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above-mentioned requirement has to be noted that & quantaplus; as a product to the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; development community is not only everything possible? thanks to & kde; -odours is not only everything possible, but allows users and developers, & quantaplus; as soon as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows Web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this may extend the productivity of almost every task. by the program compression, they can remember & quantaplus; without any kind of scripting language.

<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list is changing any time, if you can open a file, which will not be taken out, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and complete files as templates for later use. check out the section above templates. should they try to store the selected file / text outside of the local / project assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Convert the special characters to & HTML, from the clipboard, so they appear correctly and cannot be understood correctly by the browser as formatting.</seg>

<seg id="2197">Templates are basically important document skelets, code cutlets and files for link. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, shift, or any on the system existing in the pre-level file. templates in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions they submit to the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of any template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary, binary files are normally inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are listed under global templates. further information on the templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text file type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple report for the purpose and organises the work in appropriate ways to efficiently be efficient. some examples may be found in advance-tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not included a new document based on a template, but the same text area should always be included in the documents. you can find out a comment via a final menu system to Javascript or Perl basis. see for more information about the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name suggests, they are used for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents, which can be arranged in a folder structure. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to your choice (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template, save local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this has happened, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the repository. look under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and store on File As a template can store as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be drawn easily with pulling and placing on the tree view.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file just into a template folder, so you can use all file management features, such as pulling and insert or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a folder on the right and select a folder icon in the file tree or on a folder and secure a name for the template, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very well-oriented approach. you can add headlines and footlines or dynamically with & PHP; create, add files or associated with them. additionally, some things can easily be associated with using templates in projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template's structure in the subwindows templates is based on the files contained in $KDEDIR / share / apps / apps / templates and $HOME / .kde / templates / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders matches one of four types of containers, as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the folder's behavior in the table of mouse button, click on the folder and select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is canceled, as soon as elteristic attributes is outlawed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fit for everything except for family folders. if a regular folder would deactivate it, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would be found something like text-module. if nothing appears, you'll probably be found in a family folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows the set or subsequent text for templates in this folder. this could be general head lines or footlines for all templates for a specific project and enabled a folder with special head lines / footlines a complete presentation with the appropriate headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, you can press context menu (click on the right button of mouse button) over a full command collection for adding folders or insert templates from a place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; the first mode replaced the source text editor from the VPL; editor and the second shares the editor window in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: it does a document such as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and edit the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; Editor is visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor to a document, which contains the PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; file editor. to edit & PHP; there is no plans to modify this conduct.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode does not work exactly like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the VPL; -Editor synchronously, this mode has enabled the active cursor from a window to others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings quantum.... After selecting VPL, you can automatically choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. if necessary, the recommendation is automatically set for fast computers and a large range for slow motion.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming that, one wants to change the title of this website, so the processing of invisible tags in working with the VPL; editor is also called, as soon as a new document with the VPL; Editor is created. this is the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags gives the storage of information about the document themselves e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing two buttons below or by clicking on the contents, e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key password to the contents -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in a browser. you can add CSS-rules using buttons below the list or delete. a change on the list is possible exactly as with the Meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to incorporate an external CSS styling system by pressing the file open button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursor is like in a text processing, possible by paths with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the marking works as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing, using button or distaste.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is made in the same way via the toolbars, as in source text editor, which is done before the insertion of tags, previously existing tags, enclosed with text, must be removed with text, every other surrounding anchor must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables-wizard or the lists-wizard are disabled. later, they will work in & VPL; in this release, tables or lists toolbar must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indications on the places where maybe only the indentation had changed. the merge of this changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">Thus, this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white signs. later, any of further useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare text quickly, copy it easily into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the comparisons and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a complete file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging will be fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of coats, and displays the original file sharing. in this Editor, you can even edit the result. in this Editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files in merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you make the same folder with the same and merge folder. this image shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and visualize the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visibly. if rows only differ in certain number of white signs, you can see at a glance at the Summary in the column on the left. (no stumbling if any change is changing.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If one file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then shows the color to which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can easily write the typing work by writing only the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder perch1 folder perch2 folder, diff3 folder perch1 folder perch2 folder perch2 folder pern2 folder folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows the manual page of filenames, select your selection through the file browser (file...) or select a third file. you need to specify a third file, if you have to leave the file for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge folder will be selected, for B and C, however, using & kdiff3; file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If they are crossed, the input field is active for target and it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file, however, you can run this step later while saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare an entire file, but only parts of a text. & diff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard. in comparison, you have to select any files, you can simply connect the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes contains a file, e.g. several similar functions. if you want to figure out how much larger effort. you would need to create and compare two relevant files, you can easily copy and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can remove anything from & kdiff3; only pull out the case from text into a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and insertion (instead of copying and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the Info-line contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that the mouse is optional). (if the path turns into a file, you will leave the mouse over the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B colour green and C is magenta. (this default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, the color is different. if both files differ is the default color is red. (color for conflicts in settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summarization column. if differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters is not so important, only the relevant changes are visible. (with C / C + +, e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and reviews, for Preprocessor and in few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the column column of text, is interrupted at the locations where the respective source file has no lines. when the line slump is activated, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result list (below the comparison stern) also has an info-line with the inscription Edition:, the filename and [feelings] when you have the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!! up to all conflicts are dissolved, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons jump to next dissolved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference is also to be replaced either by means of a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group is displayed in all windows. (this will also be displayed on the first line of the group, where the beginning of the group is not visible.) This group is highlighted the current group. it becomes clear with the color background color to the left and on the left shows a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic merge or by manual editing, no further line left in the group. this text is displayed because you may change your opinion, and perhaps again another source. this text is not copying or later in a mark that you might want to copy and what else could.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; distribution conflict is, however, appears in the clipboard when you copy these text from the query pane. cautiously with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources can ignore options or ignore Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in figures or comments are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image run and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard, right, up-down, side down, side down, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also use other programs here. the supervisor column in addition to the vertical image-bar can also be used by clicking on the navigating button.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the insertion button you can switch between plug-in and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries columns synchronize the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section merge and the editing window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation using the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Figure downward) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Move Down / Ctrl-Figure downward) or to the next / previous conflict, continue to solve the conflict. therefore, between dissolved and unsolved conflicts have to be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you'll need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this option is checked, automatically copy the copy automatically. be careful when you write to the clipboard, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenenden are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. UNIX variants use a line-in-feed string\, and Win32-based systems use car output + Zeilenvorcede\\ r\. Kdiff3 does not retains the source file source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and restored when starting the next start. (setting up menu &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a script with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides scriptures with variable width to choose, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in cursive script will not be displayed. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, several colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed. on these systems, the button presets automatically creates an unloaded color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tabulator button inserted a tabulator character.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When pressing the input or return, the incoming line is automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection will automatically copy into the clipboard. manually copy the manual into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to store. the default value is commonly used based on the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files & kdiff3; first, all fully identical rows can be found in the source files. the second step is to ignore white characters. this step will not ignore white characters. this step will not ignore white characters. this step will not ignore white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car back character '\\ r' and a line slot '\' at the end of one line, but then they can only store files with different sizes in side-on-side comparison, but they may be deactivated using different sizes in side-side comparison, but this option must be deactivated. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of analysis we will ignore numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '.', '.'. in the result, the differences are displayed, but they will be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive to even smaller differences look. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow to very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic skip mode, this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next ungodest conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is a manual selection). if you only need any number of files in many files, then use the Automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are handled in chapter to scan folders and perform a merge. check for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and an older version exists, then the original version is added to the Suffix .original file already, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to stop & kdiff3; stop and restart that the change is active in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available, because the language is set global via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry, if this option is activated, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">On the selection fields for the coding, a short notice appears that the local encoding is. (this can not be changed here and has purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file coding for source files. this is how special characters can be treated and interpret. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have processed an file, you can specify which coding are to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you could possibly not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be encoded with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn it off to suppress highlighting changes in text or beliefs. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences may be seen in a colorfully coded overload column. but sometimes you might see only the differences between two of three files. according to the selection of A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C and B & lt; -C, next to the normal still a second overload column with the required information is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply click the less important window. (this option is in the window menu).</seg>
<seg id="2347">Select the comparison window by side or each other. this can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the Window Menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, you consider the differences and decide to merge files. if you only compare two files. a simple click launches the file name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge command, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first be delivered to this external command. in & diffdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which allows you to cut-out parts or correct settings.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it will first be delivered to this external command (see above), then the output of the command command is used (see above), then you can write your own pre-processing command, which translates exactly your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, any user would like to program an external program, and most users would like to program the good news, however, that in most cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line command to convert the input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ U in the first monary string.\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). *\\ '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you want to experiment with SED, you might start to understand and perhaps you may like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignorance of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line balance. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character is just replaced by anything, so you would be deleted by anything.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several considerations at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to use the objectives of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED, you can use something different such as perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / switch', however some details are different. where SED\\ (and\\) are needed, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">Data after normal preprocessor will be retained for viewing and merge. other operations only change the data collected by the line-off-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal Preprocessor, the line-type preprocessor is the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but like any function, the text changes or differences, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in one folder. this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursive.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... making any object a suggestion to assemble; you can adjust the proposal before start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can the merge and simulate the simulated changes without having to perform them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparisons and merge of single files. you only need to open folders on the command line or in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, Folder 1 will be used as the basis. if no target folder was specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts to run. in order to run the merge, you must press the respective menu entry or press the F7 button. (further details follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder informs you a small news panel about the current progress. if you break down the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scan of the folder is completed, & kdiff3; a list window with results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder of all folders found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can fold up a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or on the object double-click. the directory menu contains two functions all sub-directories and fold all the subdirectories with which you can fold or down all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file will be started off and it appears as a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation can not be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started automatically, you will be informed about the problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, columns are used in the columns A / B / C color red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, in identical entries, however, the color is identical, even if the age of the entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder are regarded as identical when all of its content is identical. then the same folder also have the same color. with folders, the age is invisible for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow turns and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. if A folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such incorrect objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if A folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such incorrect objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronising is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folders have been synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: merge and save the result into both folders. (the user looks as the visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after the merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merge (unsafe), then examine & kdiff3; the date of files and calculates the newer file to copy. if the files are identical, but the date is identical, but that error message can not be eliminated, the merge folder will not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While the merge becomes a file after the other. the status column shows how the merge has been successful, and correspondingly other messages, if something unexpected occurs, you should review last review, and see if the status is in order everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When used for installation dialog, the file-comparative Analysis is selected, Kdiff3 will display additional columns. these contain number of unsolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or combined.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can assemble either the selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all co-hr promotions (also in all subfolders) you can run the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you don't have any target folder, then in the three-file merge mode C, B is selected as a target and used for synchronising A and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries should be displayed in the folder file, you can also check some options by certain entries. check those options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To compose all entries: select directory entry / continue in the folder menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). in order to run only the current entry: select Aktion in the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">When contradictory file types still exist invalid, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you run all entries, a dialog window with options pass through, simulating and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulating if you would like to see what would happen without which really changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then has certain actions with all entries with all entries. if a manual encroachment is necessary (summarize a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you're ready to start with a file, select another directory entry / continue or press F7. if you don't have yet saved, an appropriate dialog appears. then & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the conclusion of the list, you'll notice some error messages which will help you to dissolve the problem of the problem or dissolve the problem to solve any other action before going on with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually combined, see & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and does not result together. even if this compilation was transferred or not saved, these entries will be considered as done. only if you modify the merge action, these entries will be combined once again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (Settings menu - &gt; Kdiff3 setup...) now has a section called Register of Properties with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that will fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. they can be entered several patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default directory do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be more than a pattern set, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be more than a pattern set, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that are also ignored by CVS. many autmatically produced files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set using a .cvsignore file. (check out at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidefile attribute. in other file systems, a leading point is selected. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element-tree or not. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched, symbolic links are compared, if the option is switched on, the files are compared to indicate the links. this is deactivated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Links to the folder: if the option is switched on, the links are switched on. if the option is switched on, the links are handled and recursively. (note that & diff3; a link to a folder that lead to itself and & kdiff3;) This option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Complete analysis every file through and displays the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower if it is applied to files which contain no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folders through a slower network, it may be faster, only the change date and file size would be higher. please use caution. this option is required in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the changing date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered equal, if they are equal, this may be useful if the copying date is lost. please use caution. this option is disrupted in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode if two folders are compared and no target directory. in this mode, the suggestions for merge files are identical, too, the results are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered insure, because the other file has not been changed.) This option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted by other files, the original version will be replaced, then the normal merge file with the .original extension already exists, this will not only be able to merge operation. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder swap file remains visible in bringing together single files; you can switch the window parts with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the window or text windows to switch the main window in the Window Menu and switch between the two screens between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare one file simply by double-click. if you want to run a single file, you can run the current file merge with the merge menu. once you have the result, the status will be done automatically and the file will not run once again when you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, however, if you read the directory again: new menu: read:</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax as local files and folders. some things should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively and.... that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty sheet &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. a brief list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder. then, a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, FTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or change accounts from the original. (please note this option to commit the size.) (this is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop always starts the built-in differences viewer. in order to start with Kdiff3, press the right mouse button above the Differences and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as KPart, the input file carries a patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then install & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a Patch-file and select from the context menu. please note that this doesn't work when the original files exists since the production of the patch file has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is done, it supports only the comparisons of two files, a very small tool toolbar and menu. the merge or the comparisons is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it is Kompare) already. in addition, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can result in combination with the diff3 program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use the GPL-programs already very long and have learned a lot by taking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that go through this way or go to him.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have thought the program compiled and the configure script will probably be notified to KDE. in default, configure the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical as identical; if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical., similar to EACH other, this is cogbut this is OFTEN the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The Editor noted for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends. this important information is lost, however, if the result is simply stored as text file, and it's too much effort to design an own file format which could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too large. you can recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit greater amounts of text, another editor should be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src soothes; published and the text can't be extinguished. what does it mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to emphasize differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the Changelog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install & kdiff3; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives you the folder to your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Because & kdiff3; auto-conf and automake should you have any problems with compile. however, they should appear difficulties, please report on the & kde; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or conversion-removing) into the clipboard and deletes the marked text. insert (Ctrl-V or conversion-insertion) adding the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences show: files that are identical in all folders are not published in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you must read and read the folder to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are showing that identical files are not already copied to the target folders. if the destination folders are not already copied, they are missing after the merge. (behaviour is likely to be modified in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group. if the lines are already existing, they will be removed when clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. undershoot in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minishow of all virtual working areas. it's quite convenient to change the running programs on the workspace to change their size or move it. this works both within a desktop and in several ways.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual working areas as well as those in running applications. applications can be selected and even on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the central mouse button you can move windows within & kpager; the movement is possible in either desktop and on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends, where the right mouse button is click on the empty background of & kpager; however, the context menu has been clicked within & kpager; however, the context menu and the name of the application, as well as the entries minimize, maximize, Towards and commands.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. it appears only if an application was clicked.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to selected virtual desktop. it appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the Desktop and also on other workplaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpager; the name of virtual workspaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Crossing this field leaves the & kpager; view the numbers of virtual workspaces. it is crossed together with name, you will have the names with folder, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small window in & kpager. otherwise, only empty workspaces will be displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window. simply shows simple rectangles with the program window. symbol displays the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a little view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & kpager; main window will be determined: classic leaves & kpager; in a 2xn-grid, all virtual working areas in a horizontal row indicates what is very good for displaying side at the desktop on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager miniature program in the control bar. it also has the advantage that it can display and move window as symbols or with their content. it also runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Clicking the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent select switch-switch... lets the dialog be released.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently it cannot be changed in the dialog for Settings: but you can manually do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or VI. If you have no write permission to enter your system administrator. in this file you need to enter the key windowTransparent mode and assign the value to this file. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot. it is thought to help people suffer from the repetic of the jury (RSI) syndrome and those of each mouse click pains. this requires however a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can switch to the pain while exercising mouse, and helps to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you suffer from pain using the use of your computer. unfortunately, you should consult a doctor, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it even more clear: even if & kmousetool; pain helps during clicking with the mouse, it's anti-pain, useless. and like with all ergonomic relief devices, the result can be quite different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse motion and runs a mouse click, once you break the movement short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart shifting activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after pressing the mouse button. now move the mouse, waiting until the Losing of the mouse button. the smart shifting requires a little practice, but you will get rid of it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This devastation time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click leads.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If it is switched on, the rotary field shift (1 / 10 s) is enabled. here the time is set, the & kmousetool is waiting; after shutdown the mouse button, before leaving the mouse button, if the mouse is done.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click through mouse sliding. this function is activated, followed by a break, one click with right mouse button. this movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can get to shorten the response time. open on Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the Tabs General. there is a slider sound buffer where you can set up a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; at any start of & kde; started. this function is currently only under & kde; please refer to the respective documentation to find out how you will automatically start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set up all the settings back when opening dialog. have you already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the user after the last press.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool, initially with presets. in particular, the smart shifting should be disabled first. if you then click on the automatic mouse, you can later take the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the response times of & kde; to decrease sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should consciously make a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window, which cannot use any link. you can park the mouse at such places, until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is trucked, you should clean your mouse. this is normally quite simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse, but also the rolls that come in contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. like this happens, mouse is to mouse different. but it should be clear, however, if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you should have to see the rolls. these are attached to the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the trick and dirt can scratch easily with a flat blade or fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; when just a shift step was started. if you're using a shift step, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can't end anymore due to the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you are using & kmousetool; using a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; set back and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use mouse to place the cursor as you want. but if you want to make it possible. however, if you want to make sure that the mouse click on a neutral area of desktop that the mouse buttons are unwashed. secure zones for the mouse buttons and menus and the track lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shifting, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes his time before moving it into the clipboard and add to any other action when you want to move into the clipboard. but it will probably be ready to cause any other problems. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart shifting to use, if you just want to use & kmousetool; click on the one end of the text area, and hold the switch button, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and re-press the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always be played when & kmousetool; the mouse button is expressing a sound like a mouse click. later you can use the smart shifting without the audible mouse click. but it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">In order to use & kmousetool; you have to install the XTest extension for & X Window; it should already be the case.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and configured it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; used the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointers short distorted. this program was designed for people who suffer on RSI Syndrome and to those working of the mouths pains.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured as a certain time waiting for a pulling-process begins before the mouse is left off. this way can also be done using your mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2542">With possible kttsd as a language service, & kmouth is used as the first attempt to pass the text to KTTSD language service. if this is successful, the following settings will be further developed on this page. the option for this option is useful, even if KTTSD is not installed.</seg>
<seg id="2543">The first selection box after the selection of a text passage determine which action is triggered by the keyboard shortcut or by choosing a text passage in the text box book or in the bar for passages.</seg>
<seg id="2544">With the selection of Sofort, the selected text passage is inserted directly and in addition to the transfer memory, the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2545">With the second drop-box closing of the editing window, you can define if the text box book will be automatically stored in the closing of the processing window.</seg>
<seg id="2546">With the selection of text-passagebook, the book is stored. if you discard changes, the text passagebook is not stored. please select to store & kmouth; ask if the text box book is to be saved.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, text is processed, before being sent to a program of speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace incorrectly spoken words or shortcuts, or to select appropriate language and speaker or to deal with specific defects of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the work of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four kinds of lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen-Readern has the highest priority. it is withdrawn from all other orders. if the edition of the Screen Reader is read, the received orders are continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning will notice and keeps the output of messages and usual text. these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example used for an application that allows for news. while you & eg; a long text on a web page you can see, just entering the room. & kota; notifications are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are easy text orders. every order you encounter with the card ticket orders is a text order. KSayit is an example for a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in waiting-long, with the exception of the edition of Screen Readers. when an application is sending the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just such a figurative, this edition will be stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen editing. they are applied to normal warnings, news and text orders as well as on & kde; -messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter process the text and go on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replace parts of a text by other text. you can specify either as words or as regular expressions, which enable the creation of chat emoticons as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>

<seg id="2633">With voice instructions filtering, you can send orders dependent on the content of the text, or dependent on the text, sent to a speaker. if you have to set a female voice, you can read text by KDE-News about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters can be applied to which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter is fixed, its rules does not indicate that the text remains unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent by all activated filters, which were set up on the page below. the processing by the filters are displayed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2638">For the installation of strings or regular expressions, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison list, then the text is replaced by the associated substitute text. major and small letters will not be considered when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose a name for this name, it simply needs to distinguish itself from the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column, and replace it in accordance with the strings from the column. the list is displayed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices, voice speed, sex, sex, voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation for example abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) as it is the standard voice, the festival in the edition of SSML.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional recognition filter (SDB filter). SBDs must start reading, because only the first sentence must be synthesized, not to stop or cancel, or cancel, even if the language synthesizer is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional recognition filter. when the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set to set a propositional filter. you can change their settings or add further Satal recognition filter, but we will not use it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the easiest way, you can learn the device selection, select the speaker and select text. turn on the card selection, select some properties and check out how the user's selection has changed. for this, you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>

<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal movement identifier filter automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be removed only. change nothing to this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional recognition filters compare text with a regular expression of Satzenden and add a tabular sign (decimal code 8) to the diagrams (input characters automatically from the text). please note that the default setting is included in the character.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This handbook explains the installation and use of & cretworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that enables the network interface, routing, and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings through a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & crisp-box; -Package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from & kcontrolcenter; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter, displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & scarlet hardware; network hardware can't install. physical equipment and their drivers have already been installed and configured to configure & crush workconf; it allows the device to set up the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed when installing & Linux; with installed and set up. network devices will be added later, the drivers have to be loaded by adjusting the following files, corresponding to kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Settings module is loaded when the network settings in & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. starting from the module network settings, this, the platform is automatically recognisable to recognize the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the platform is offered, the platform is to select the platform that distribution and release is best. by marking the setting of non-re-questions, the network settings can be met permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will then be preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed, what does the settings can only be viewed, changing the system management mode to the right bottom end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab Network interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Setting up the settings shown can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button to setup a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. Click the button to display the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">When selecting automatically the TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server, all required TCP / IP settings for each system start is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP server can be selected in the system, corresponding to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Using the selection manual, without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. the network mask is required.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values set in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address would not be used in the network. the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can specify if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched on. activate one ad network device via selecting from the list and click on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off after necessary. off from a activated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and click to disable interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">In addition, the IP address of the computer is fixed in the local subnet, which conveys physical connection to remote networks and is used by default in TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway computer is to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support will be replaced by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if computers are only IP-addresses. if the computer is only IP-address, DNS triggers this name into an IP address such as 123,45,678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The machine for the name resolution part of the equator name resolution allows easy administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or amended wer.DNS entries can be arranged or downgrading in the list with buttons up or downgrading in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By pressing the button to add... from the group of hosts a DNS server, a DNS server can be added to the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the button to click. the entry will then be inserted into the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group of calculator for naming resolution you choose one entry and then click on the button edit.... It will display the editing dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of well-known computers describes computer-to-IP address references to the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting, if no DNS server are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS-servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list of well-known computers contains several entries, which support & apos; localhostages; and some special IPv6 addresses. this is still in the test version of IP should replace 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add.... The Dialogue New alias will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then with clicking OK, the list of the static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings provided in Module network settings are not immediately applicable to the system. in order to enable the changes, the following command must be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface like kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient, but in addition, the development packages with libraries and others are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & crisp workconf. these commands should make this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology are given, in the second all by & knetworkconf; changeable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace detailed knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great distribution. IPv6 is expected to use in the near future. this description is currently focusing on the standard IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; Workstation is the administrator, which can be used as a valid IP address, if available, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When placing an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from table below are not forwarded during the Internet, therefore their arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, the addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 is usually used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called Standard route that is the second the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for the IP transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section the configuration files, which are affected by & cretworkconf, and where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file can sometimes be dynamically changed with DSL connection, so that if in case of active DSL connections, another content is set to be set there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat, is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. the first goal was offered to create several archives on a band. the second target was a question for tar which asked my wife: how much longer does it take?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be of & dat, which can be mounted on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "& dat, playing the band and reads the pretenant information of the banker." "" "recognize & dat, who won't be formatted on the band if the band is formatted." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat, looking for the matching index on your disk. can't be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drives, to indicate that the band became involved. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched for the band by means of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before selecting the banker, initially, the integration must be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "& dat," "" "gives a change of the symbol to recognise the band that the band has been solved and shows an appropriate message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without danger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & dat, it must be formatted by & dat, formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band species must be formatted before you need to use file format before you need to formatted the band. if you need to formatted a band before using the band of & dat, it does not have formatting the tape of tape, DAT drives cannot be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, the band will continue with the formatting of the tape. after completion of the tape, the band will be automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the backup process. that can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Choose a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a secure profile profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a bunch. only the selected files and / or subfolder are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the Move Corner menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog for Backup. in this dialog you can check even the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirmed the settings, the dialog box appears. dialogue shows the progress of securing output including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder is checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a bunch. only the selected files and / or subfolder are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure was started, the dialog for Settings. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the settings for checking, the dialog will appear. this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can forward the restore, the files that are re-produced are selected, which can be selected in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Choose a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a bunch. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process was started, the dialog for Restoration. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the settings for restoration, the dialog appears restoring. this dialogue shows the progress of recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it's necessary to re-create the bandindexfile using the tape-containing. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can compose the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a secure profile profile with the just selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a Secure profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should be done. the list of associated files will be automatically updated according to the chosen key folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under the backup files that are specified in the same file system, just like the folder. files that are based on other file systems, you can enter separately under backup files. any entry will be viewed by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since last incremental backup, a snapshot file is secured since then, only the files have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">This deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes that all files are secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; lt; lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set via the menu item KDat... in menu settings. the following settings can be set:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file system for tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must indicate the non-rewinding variant of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & dat, before the band is connected to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary to be carried out prior to read or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tried & dat, the throw from the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the pin is ignored by loosening & dat, automatically reject the tape. do not use this option at floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tried & dat, all drives support variable block sizes for tape drives. no matter whether this setting is active or not you need & dat, in any case the block size for your tape drive will communicate.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat, a band deformatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the band. this file should prove only one memory block on the tape. the contents of this file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is billing: seconds, whereby the name of the system is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch, which has been formatted to the band.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name at the $HOME / .kdat / folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar-archives created directly with & GNU; tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not to be incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup band. this symbol is only active if a band is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -viewer for system log. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, where you can get information about your system, or where system allows you to get information about your system, or where system enables quick access to access information about problems related to your server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the program is appropriate for inexperienced users that can't know where to get information about your system, or where system files can be stored in the different protocol.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & systemlog; experienced users can perform fast access to information about problems that occur on their server. & systemlog; therefore, some extended functions can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol-files certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocol files, for the format of the Syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition to the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following commands, displays & ksystem log; functions available to easily filter the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching & ksystemlog, first the system log file is tried to open, and it opens up a small news window, so you will not open it with system administrator right. the protocol files are usually not included in the file / var / log, for normal users, usually do not have access to reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter toolbar to filter for a certain criterion or according to set strings. in default, the list of the log lines will be automatically displayed. in default, the protocol line will be displayed, if in one of the columns contain the strings of the filter search.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this position. then, for example, select the column process in the corresponding column. in addition, for example, in the protocol-file system protocol, you can also tell you & ksystem log; all the minutes-lines, which were sent and created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default settings and helps you to recognise the key protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a strikingly color as a protocol lines. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched on setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Do you want to show this process only (e.g. in the system log or in cron protocol), so you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you would like to examine the output of a specific command such as for example to the start of the Samba server. in this case, you can use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can select the option to set new lines in the main window menu, in order to view all the new add-in lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple minutes files in separate subwindows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindows. once you select a sub-window, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has your own website on http: / / system.forum-software.org. you find more information about the information sources of & ksystemlog.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& systemlog; also see in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion Archivs: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V init Editor, rather well known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V init develops quickly to the standard for control program starts when running the system in the & Linux; this is because it's easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (such as I don't know about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is therefore under / etc and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V init without any reinstallation and re-format. therefore, you need to ensure that the old init was removed from there, if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init differs from the BSD init that configuration files in a subfolder of / etc / etc. this folder is rc.d. Dort you find rc.sysinit and following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to run on another runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services does not include such things like setserial that is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be, rather than / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches at different places after the program init and starts the first thing that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the preset-made runlevel 3 is. if you'd like to change it / etc / inittab, then you can repair it, then get it to re-repair the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it now start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is one of the scripts in the init.d scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written that there is a argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would read the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K includes, the script will be called on the stop (if he is a S), the script will be called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to establish a simple way to establish machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level, just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. running. furthermore I could have a user-runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand-device is simple to say trivial: simply drag an entry in the area of availability system services to one of the six round level to launch it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts even between Runleveling or change the position within one levels by taking it different. this will only happen if you prefer an entry from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only take an entry in the area of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed when you move this into a new section. in order to select a new runlevel, you have to select from the Edit menu or select from the context menu -- even if the same entry has already existed in the destination area previously.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the ambient entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no option to restore items which have been thrown into the paper basket. so you be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to activate the various working areas (Available System services, runlevel 1 Start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another round-level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change sorting order or change the button to change the Properties dialog. specify the dialog button to accept the dialog to accept the changes, or press Esc to disclose the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the menu require confirmation before they will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are taken in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available, otherwise it will be available from & ksysv; otherwise it will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard laptops, and now the machine starts to constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and modify the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which only exist in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">This species, such as system services started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please check whether all configuration files are required (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply without message if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be of version different. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user; reading.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After changing changes, you have to save them. either use the appropriate toolbar or entry in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cartridge cards, user and user ranking. for editing the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cartridge cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have extended system settings, you will find individual settings, if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd will be installed like in BSD universes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map pass is appears when shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This cartridge card is only enabled in case for at least one embedded file system (Quota) and initialize (recognizable at the file quotas / quotas group on the file system). here you can change parameters on each user, although the limited liability in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted separately for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field of the field.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card-card groups informs about the group's irregularities of the selected user. the standard group that belongs to the user you can find in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can mark the user in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, add addition from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate execution button of the toolbar. edit or delete the selected user or the selected group.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot Manager, add, remove and change the time to booting the standard operating system, add the standard operational system, remove, modify operating systems, modify, modify and more.</seg>
