although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have read American authors and operated his sports .
in fact , this country had a pro@@ found effect on me , that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
when 14 years old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible re@@ porter , who co@@ inci@@ ded with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student who wanted to occup@@ y his interest in the German Supreme Court .
I was caught .
free after Method Man , &quot; I was it , whether that &apos;s the absolute Truth , forgot everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose variety is so inviting , that you are always that you are and it &apos;s easy acceptance in a community of equal human beings .
I had even written a very little love letter concerning his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written over the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
for me , the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ en@@ sion is towards me as he walks with his involvement .
he never stops behind the mountain , as it is beautiful .
he says exactly what he did think like a former colleague , declar@@ es publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ am@@ us and women .
yet people have responded to his statements and agreed in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number of the party nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that support this big@@ s person , asked me ?
I could not know Tr@@ ump and his v@@ oters with the people who I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journ@@ alism program , people from all over the world , a deeply troubled man , with whom I could talk about Islam and past .
in this , Tr@@ umps did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to view the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ umps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I lived with Sandy B@@ ahr , who f@@ ights their lives in the environment , and her husband , Dave , my host family , who treated myself like her son .
yet it adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace to help us to am@@ per@@ ate the complexity of American life .
then Andrew le@@ ak@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , have helped me with my ment@@ ors to help me in my career .
these people and those affected by them em@@ bodied my love toward America .
during his way to the nominal republi@@ can Presidential candidates , she b@@ aked me a halt and the counterpart of its limited vision of America .
however , it presented itself , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps due to his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ frontation with the idea that humans have voted for tr@@ ump because they were either authorized by rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , and broke me almost the heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps it &apos;s un@@ fair to describe the Tr@@ ump v@@ oters as a sh@@ aving .
the people , said , &quot; said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and resp@@ ect@@ ful , suggest@@ ing an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears are not considered to be considered in their communities .
could it be that this v@@ oters , of which most knows , have approved for dr@@ unk@@ ards , because they would like to reg@@ ain control over a country that she disappointed ?
in other words , they would perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , which comments the cru@@ el decision to raise a man , which look with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( up . ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white against all other ethnic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white against all other eth@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( like en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ trau@@ ma ) , as much as the big Van Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; has exactly the killed what America was so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether my@@ th or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background can always be always , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose the son of an Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history as he himself says , anywhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promises to promise and says : towards Hell with regard to freedom , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the ru@@ der , they say .
in all of whom I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he said at the eve of the election .
at a rally in Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; bro@@ ker the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out and their voices were pure .
&quot; would someone like you , isn &apos;t such a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son , sent to him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Country , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find no more space in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ e@@ ah ?
that the music , played at both locations , is not only changing the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music - living with the waste
Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill colony , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ heated ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments , has an opportunity to overcome them surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for its drugs abuse and the bonds force .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project , and the youth always offered a rare hop@@ el@@ ist .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
you always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ st@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura is playing around the biggest land@@ fills of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ay@@ an capital - on instruments which are made of recycled waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments that consist of local fixed waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez has begun to transform parts of the drop into instruments .
the instruments im@@ it@@ ates violin , viola , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones and percussion .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article of Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez rec@@ alls R@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local teacher and musician instructor of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ah , at the beginning :
first , it was very difficult because we had no room to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to accept the children in the tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he never had previously seen : a violin made from waste .
today , there is a complete orchestra that plays on instruments made of re @-@ prepared material and is named The Recyc@@ led Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary N@@ ames &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance on : &quot; &quot; &quot;
each year , the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and of him are the sleeves as people in Cat@@ e@@ ah , Paraguay .
and they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectac@@ le from rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played its music before Pope Francis :
these ost@@ African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight for illegal fishing companies
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought wild il@@ og@@ y fishing .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that specifically regarding international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release takes place within the framework of a agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of content .
in West Africa , this ship was already known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing fishing before the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were therefore increased accordingly and little gen@@ ei@@ ving , a law crimin@@ als welcome this kind to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compress@@ ors , Mozambique and Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised themselves quickly against the ship . they refused to lay a fisher@@ man to their har@@ bours and refused to come to him a fishing stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that just refuse &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is part of a team that discovered the ship and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t able to catch the fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) .
apart from Somalia and Madagascar the members of this network are the six countries who had cast out the Prime Minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and work together . they exchange information and stand each other when it goes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Tony Long , Head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is being caught , because it is extremely difficult to increase , so the illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing by regions .
by inten@@ tional respect of existing laws , certain living rooms and species is supposed to harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
however , while actions against illegal fishing once were ob@@ struc@@ ted through bureauc@@ ratic hur@@ dles , with the information between individual countries , these acts today happen in real time , with trac@@ e@@ able to F@@ ISH &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange , including lists of existing lic@@ ences , news about susp@@ icious activities or details , which you had taken or experienced during a port spec@@ tion .
fish @-@ i tra@@ des the activities of ships , too very atten@@ tive , when moving on the open lake , using satellite data .
this enables the authorities to character@@ ize ships that fish in banned areas - such as those that point to point that a ship invites its caught fish to other ships .
in the ide@@ als , such studies show whether the involved ships have a fish license , where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a pen@@ fre@@ er .
countries that are against illegal fishing devices can then refuse on the basis of such ships in their ports . what means that ships cannot sell their load . and they even could be forced to be pun@@ ish@@ able as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it will be substantial financial losses for the owners , meaning that the illegal catch catch is financi@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform has been created to recover lost 20 million USD in lost sales , the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i lost every year because of illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate into Eastern African waters .
East Africa has under@@ taking one of the most productive t@@ una fishing fishing trails , attrac@@ ting commercial fishing from all over the world , among these also st@@ ori@@ ally those illegal fishermen .
among other things , actions include the sailing under false flag , counter@@ feit license papers , indication of ph@@ asi@@ en@@ amen , fish protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the missing international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship managed to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You will not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
F@@ ISH has been involved in more than 30 investigations since its inc@@ eption .
it has revealed criminal networks un@@ covers the fal@@ si@@ bly lic@@ ences in Tanzania . discovered ships that have several dec@@ eit@@ ful identi@@ ties and found it pursu@@ ing flying ships and found them .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authorities on com@@ b@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing via large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that can help F@@ ISH @-@ i to produce susp@@ icious ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s Satell@@ it@@ System , which is always developed further , helps to qu@@ it illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are attemp@@ ting to cross @-@ crossed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also offers technical support and F@@ ISH technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships can switch their automatic identification systems , where they cannot be stack@@ ed by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can really take influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be rendered to each of each individual trac@@ eable ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get in order to get a better picture of it , who &apos;s what does - this makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance to un@@ ite and develop their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on a global level . &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project to run on the global system tracking of ships .
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crimin@@ als , but they also scre@@ ams .
ships that had previously f@@ ished without license and hardly need to calculate with consequences , know that they can be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participated in F@@ ISH countries by a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , more lic@@ ences for more licenses ever since fishing boats .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 had helped the insp@@ ectors there , found the insp@@ ectors there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these achievements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a research project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined together , for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now fight against illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with safety , even more such initiatives and structures also occur in other regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest membership in Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the way under false flag , and not only the ship used without a license and have been banned tow@@ ing nets .
the ship was still included in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH , this is another success of many . and at the same time , the evidence is that such special , collaborative work is actually working throughout the cos@@ mos . Emma Bry@@ ce is working for professional journalist and lives in London . she wrote about the topic of environment , technology and nutrition .
her article will appear in the Vienna Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is moving forward to : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to conquer the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they apply as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum to the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s Council .

after Venezuela &apos;s proposal on opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Veneti@@ ans re@@ acted to a referendum on the political and economic crisis of the country , when they were gathered in the streets .
under the H@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( roughly : the re@@ aring Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate will also be guided in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat area Bar@@ inas , in the regions of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central area of the German federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country has steadily deterior@@ ated , thereby noticeable in everyday life of the Veneti@@ ans through a acute deficiency of foods and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition looked at the president of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro took the opportunity for a fundamental change , but ultimately ob@@ struc@@ ting a re @-@ election of official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Contri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government &apos;s context in its latest article :
in the context of social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching deficiency of food and medicine , the referendum on the way to give opportunity to capture its institutional structures and to join its institutional structures .

the pictures of the mart@@ yrs , which are published in real time , bear an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also strug@@ gles with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of government .
one of the most frequently used images shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the protection signs : &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cry this Veneti@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;

particularly large waves struck the message about police supp@@ ression into the central @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to hold police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear bo@@ ck because anything else could see what many nation@@ alities do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic shows the round that forms the extent of op@@ pression per day :
thus , the dictatorship of the country supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure - this has now been demonstrated in eyes many thanks to the presence of countless people on the street .

this is an adapted version of a interviews made by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano who was initially published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , a Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba .
in the meantime , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba , against his father .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated , committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not sought his life .
starting with the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father bear witness to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la , which he observed in the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he kept family sec@@ rec@@ y for 34 years .
in the situation , I thought that this was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
back then I could not recognize that my father was a th@@ ief , fo@@ ils and rob@@ bers .
Luis I had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ ve . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a period of State of State , his father was Deputy Commander of Intelligence in La Per@@ la in 1976 @-@ 1978 .

Archi@@ v@@ View .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors , which is charged with de@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the atro@@ cities in the course of the years that he had experienced as boy , and who promised before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent , and like this child chose for himself a way of salvation .
from the Sports Hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been working with a boy , who made mar@@ tial arts .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have completed yourself with one of the ERP .
pass that they don &apos;t lead you out of one day , and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolutionary ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party in Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had stri@@ pped me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers who had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University connections , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ then the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me in the entrance .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ d@@ ges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little into a ceiling , and ordered me to wear it . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were abol@@ ished and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he po@@ inting at an open space and said :
since then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I went in , and saw a song , being tor@@ tured on men .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that she fortified the end of a cable . the other end was fixed on the body of the person , which was just bound there .
they made a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs about the bed , shot him with water and said to him a cargo of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the rock there was inside it ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father was placed under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the od@@ or immediately and me was clear that the od@@ our of a body in need is in need .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked me , &quot; How is it possible that a man can do to another so much suffering ? &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area , where the prisoners were m@@ illed with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wor@@ sen@@ ed .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilian who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses that suits nude people with the face down - all were gre@@ eted on hands and feet .
near the entrance , people quiet@@ ly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my Father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you think so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I met &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that my father told at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were called as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero spent a man there and killed a man .
( according to the survi@@ vors of the civil servant Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of death in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) was charged .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the Memorial La Per@@ la , through the former fol@@ ds chambers .
the way where you came here , is also the way where they came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this way , and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed , and they received a number assigned to the process of de@@ formation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of up was transferred .
this was lying - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought all possible things to do with home .
back then in the age , I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; - how they called it .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military @-@ scale , which one who fought against an enemy .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano with his son .
Archi@@ v@@ ise
but when you go into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ lt , then it is not a war@@ fare but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always asked myself , how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have to inv@@ ade into a house and to ste@@ al everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crimin@@ als , and I answered : and you who were on the road on the street ?
you are no det@@ ective ?
he explo@@ ded anger , struck me , and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and hanging you .
we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have not the only good memory of him .
when I told in the process , I showed a photo of at that I bore a jacket and a roller sk@@ irt of wool . both of them had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , my defence accused me to have been f@@ law@@ ed with this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me up , what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to express .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ ks is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I re@@ gre@@ t .
I have children . if you first got children , you know the value of a life .
it develops and recognizes that it is wrong , to kill .
I even went to say so far :
well , so you have ec@@ lec@@ tured throughout the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but why do the bodies disappear ?
why do children dec@@ eive ?
one day , my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - that &apos;s a little girl .
again I asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they would have been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but why would they disappear their bodies ?
did people not have families , to whom they could commit their mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ ri@@ ble act , which can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they hol@@ den machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere dispos@@ ed - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my Father .
but anything remains always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the gl@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my Father .
the thought , indicate my Father , arose during a conversation , was placed under house arrest .
I made him acc@@ us@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to see his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t put any@@ body to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt right away and asked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which all @-@ selling patri@@ o@@ tism , and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they were allegedly defended , actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I sh@@ ou@@ ted :
how can you say something to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed a terrible crime , and you have forced me to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Now then he po@@ inting me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that did I do exactly .
in 2010 , I ref@@ unded the first ad .
finally I had recognized that he was a crimin@@ als .
nobody can pre@@ set me that I am pre@@ ingen@@ ious . I eventually said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in house arrest in May 2015 , standing before the end of the trial .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the extent of the decision of the sentence .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended because of crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 , against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 And op@@ press@@ ors found guilty of crimes against humanity ; the court sentenced him to life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases were pun@@ ished by 2 and 14 years . in six cases , it was fre@@ ighted in six cases .
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ per@@ la@@ ze : murder , torture and ra@@ pe with officials . # Es@@ war@@ ov@@ ec@@ ror@@ ism
all def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian staff .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was ab@@ duc@@ ted along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 , and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Tribunal is a historical landmark for all human rights organisations that worked for years on righteousness for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer of the Argentine organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , represents the children of men who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government had found the country on which La Per@@ la was erected there to be a memorial station , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was dissemin@@ ated in the social media .
adap@@ ting the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Kyoto town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence , last month witness of a very particularly mis@@ fortune .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was shown on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ko@@ rei@@ ther sh@@ a ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means accid@@ entally - but maybe even with ar@@ es@@ sem thanks &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance and the building itself .
working of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into social media .
the error was taken by the translator Julian Holmes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ oto . he was also aware of the local time @-@ tim@@ ings .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n writes in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it be such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a reward for older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrec@@ t English translation was initially removed . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible Auto@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was subsequently replaced by the appropriate , but gramm@@ ar is not quite correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Kyoto , ap@@ olog@@ ized for translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text , and the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told about the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , older people responded by in@@ adequate correction ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The translation ) &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News established some more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older car drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ o@@ unced as in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , which are involved in accidents , but also for concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by the sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this increase the share of 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents decreased in total , the proportion of senior citizens caused accidents in the same period has increased .
the well @-@ known re@@ porter brought in the version of the article published in Yahoo , which shows that pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparent against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible Auto@@ ers &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually the translation is not bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that a true translation error is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; spread so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real foundation for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .
photo by Flick@@ r users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation defects are mani@@ fold .
for transferring , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and transmit active language skills to transfer him to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is in the case of mother@@ language . generally speaking , trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language .
thus , a French mother tongue was transl@@ ating from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo by Flick@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the native language , the translations into English . this may be missing an understanding of translation , reasons , or the relatively small number of English @-@ language artists who learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees have no foreign employees . then , the Japanese employees , whose English knowledge is considered the best , for trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Flick@@ r users Karl Baron .
mach@@ ined translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the toler@@ ated and en@@ caps@@ ulated propositions which can emer@@ ge by mach@@ ined translations , that this technique may not replace any human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages .
some of the most strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for silent reasons - not to be read or understood .

translation errors may be un@@ acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but from large enterprises or by the government to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translation .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and customs measures taken on the Internet and television
the main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ N@@ SA y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7th , Venezu@@ elan Internet users that they would not have access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay &apos;s online transmitter .
later I wrote other users that the internet inst@@ ances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are not access@@ able anymore .
other online transmitters were also carried out by protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ able groups , the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is app@@ ended , and recommended browsers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access Internet access .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ elan provider are blo@@ cked again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media are hes@@ it@@ ated at the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission threatened them with money pun@@ ishments and lo@@ tions , when they would continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Call for Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without television and informative national TV channels , I have registered myself for @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that that &apos;s still cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay caused by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two additional online transmitter . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings .
previous research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers were able to use DNS . this is a technique described by the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blo@@ cked by the DNS server , the server is def@@ ective or ref@@ uses request to call such a website .
we confirm DNS lock : @ el@@ w@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ locked channel , the transmission was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who took the protests in Caracas live , was put into custody .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in police force .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV was going back on show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thereby the Veneti@@ ans will continue to gain access to multi@@ media coverage over current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls are offered to slave dealing with education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
today Tina dic@@ ts Tina for the rights of children and collecting witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly as they became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report of Kur@@ dish , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices by courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas , Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ unding C@@ ows , Ac@@ cid@@ ent Schools &quot; ) , which will be processed and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where she didn &apos;t live together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the University she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was filled with pride over them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . when Cri@@ ad@@ itas den@@ otes more than 46@@ ,000 young boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a large family with little money sur@@ passes her younger son or her min@@ der@@ old daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not mentioned , however , that the children must not aff@@ ord countless days of home@@ work , which can never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse , which can &apos;t be raised in the context of a contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widely distributed in Paraguay because of the involvement and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , mainly young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness , resear@@ ched and den@@ o@@ unced .
she tried to call things in name , because the feeling of gr@@ atitude , that is vacc@@ inated in cri@@ tically , guaranteed in stand@@ still .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
as well , as the family , her daughter in the faith , that they close their education to improve their position in society , and &quot; something from itself , &quot; can be found to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which takes up the girl to itself and its exploitation with faith jus@@ ti@@ fies that they would have no chance to get any education , and maybe he would even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will experience many years later .
sometimes they can never learn it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomena , which takes place in the prison quarters of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ an in the hospital , her body showed traces of fier@@ c@@ ably pun@@ ches . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military department Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as civil servants .
Mar@@ ín was located in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira crossed it with a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the final punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply ro@@ oted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
you recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest to protest together and demanded that there will be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photographs were widespread in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more c@@ ows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of married couples and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded an improvement in the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case is before the court case , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín , for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming .
the Life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as a labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k was working in her father , and her father lost his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your brothers had to go all work and began to sell on the road or on the market of conf@@ ection@@ ery to earn money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at that time , they had to divide the time so that you still remained in learning .
every morning she rose up at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
for example , clean the fridge , cleaning the living room , polished furniture and infected the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home and had time to learn .
the more time it was finished with learning , the more leisure had it .
but that time was limited , because they had to do dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to hunger , but got not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the household than food from the refrigerator . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the household , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989 .
on some Ab@@ ends of the households of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , alongside him and from opposition positions such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; are reading .
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held her for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the household had someone found someone who spoke , while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they had heard my family there again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad hab@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so , they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , whose mother tongue would speak Guar@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your Lord advoc@@ ates that they had to lose their education , they would lose it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid from them with their hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discri@@ min@@ ated discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; one thing about almost never spoken , are Mo@@ b@@ bing and ch@@ ik@@ an , which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children parents have , they immediately realize that any parents who has no parents is Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I couldn &apos;t leave someone at home . I had no circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly noticeable that I belonged to none group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share importance for cleaning agents and nur@@ ser@@ y in Paraguay .
the administration in group is P@@ EPA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please supp@@ ose you .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad received five &quot; L@@ ikes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the state of the country , which would like to work . &quot;
then the disc@@ asser@@ tion of the advertisement was then once a :
love friends , I &apos;ve found one . I looked , whether it works with her .

legislative bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently approved a bill to &quot; regul@@ arities concerning the use and user of social networks . &quot;
if he is accepted by Parliament , operators and users have to register social media in Egypt during a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on basis of the law would then be set up a place that it is contrac@@ ted to use Citi@@ zens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to benefit social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the acceptance of the law , us@@ ef@@ ers and users have to register with their right name and number of recru@@ itment numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it is missed that , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragraphs and is independent in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ or application that runs over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video editing and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unc@@ le@@ ar , as the law is supp@@ os@@ edly passed by the law , as the draft shall not be imposed by users , such as those who accounts for users , not register the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media enterprises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of the Law and Supp@@ orters of Law , told the Magazine of Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and a password , &quot; by the fire@@ wall , blo@@ cked on Facebook . &quot;
that could mean that Egypt plans to set a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary for Egyptians , to submit information to their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans are :
experts and experts are sc@@ ep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Technology ( in German &quot; Senior Research Programme &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I have bol@@ ted strong on technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they &apos;re suggest@@ ing that just as they could control physical public and private spaces that could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , then this means that they are applying for a strong surveillance system to filter citizens , or not . and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and to carry out a court case .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s proposal and constitutional committees before coming into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its adoption and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military monument in the Parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a bill of legislation against cy@@ ber crime , which was found guilty on a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those who found &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the animal protective H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the NGO &apos;s NGOs work to protect the spiritual Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which are disp@@ ers@@ ed through Africa and Asia , are among the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endanger@@ ed because of their habitat , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; like Raz@@ a in the video shows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Persian Leopard is the only remaining cat@@ er@@ tier in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big prey is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards really in the free game is low and goes against zero . when the team found a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks down Raz@@ a in pure joy .
as trained Biolog@@ o , Raz@@ a is passionate about another side of their country , which does not only consist of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies with wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and focuses on that protected areas for wild animals in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , which had been achieved for the nor@@ theastern Japan , achieved the progress made by the &quot; triple @-@ cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its seat in S@@ end@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a public pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbourhood con@@ tours of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished all the coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture experienced an atomic accident , so far , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows two years from local view@@ point which have been achieved to re@@ build the life of local @-@ resident companies .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results .
the construction of housing in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( g@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i scored the biggest success under the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima , with 70 percent of the final light .
even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , they still ende@@ av@@ oured to sett@@ le for six years after the cat@@ astrophe , managed by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ac@@ u ( get caught , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) .
after the triple @-@ cat@@ astrophe nearly 80 000 people saw to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such containers .
almost 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still living in emergency accommodations in 2011 . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres were successful . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ations were shel@@ tered after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ac@@ sten , were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is 34 percent here .
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper could determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by the mis@@ fortune , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have again been put into operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of fishing ports have re@@ taken their operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land , have moved large in co @-@ face .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agriculture in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that only a consequence of the atomic fact is , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed ar@@ quit@@ oes of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , &quot; the nuclear strike of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , the tourism has largely recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , only 75 percent can be achieved .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper also reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys under the local population and ev@@ acu@@ ated by the ev@@ ac@@ uation . they asked them about the state of re@@ building and also , as their emp@@ athy changed towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o conducted an interview to bring about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents were taken in action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ d@@ ents knew that still not enough in disaster prevention .
how it stands for those who could ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has reinforced their attention to the position of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima did not only experience the huge earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ic accident , atomic accidents , Japan ever had to participate .
from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved out in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in durable spare houses .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their home pre@@ fecture .
in disaster @-@ cat@@ astroph@@ es , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are older than 50 years old . they have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima , with massive construction projects . this is a project projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
however , after a while , one recognizes that more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important because they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to re@@ mind our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we will get topics that often earn less attention than they deser@@ ve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember at a moment in which she felt very closely associated with someone over language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i speaks about the time , where she worked with people from all over the world in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week at an intensive care centre : last Friday , a police officer had hit him in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia a demonstration against the head . nationwide , millions of prot@@ esters participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social science at the federal university Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and now moved to an artificial com@@ a .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the face of the police officers are also recogni@@ zing the face of police officers , identified by a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident was announced by the Military Police in the Brazilian State of Go@@ i@@ ás that Samp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from active service .
the images show the police officers , as he performs at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his p@@ aul@@ king on the face of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira &apos;s face ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
would be a police officer of a demonstr@@ ators , and on the Inten@@ sive Station , would be to see his face six months long on television and jus@@ ti@@ fies the entire supp@@ ression .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed the video on the net , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officers , and several San@@ itary confin@@ ed shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks .
shown below the clip below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus as from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during the hospital .
&quot; be bra@@ ve , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing was dealt with several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for non @-@ violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás wit@@ nessed a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me supported Irish from his father . here , the Military Police of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who had been under attack on the Inten@@ sive Station , has been attacked by a police officer , having been defeated by a police officer , who struck him with a p@@ unch @-@ stick .
police ski@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations on Friday last Friday .
police officers were on protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had established a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ raine and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP F@@ la@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against prot@@ esters .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media stands out , considering the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists ste@@ wed : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted glass windows to illustr@@ ate with a photograph of their cover pages illustr@@ ative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; story with a set @-@ down bus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ shield than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special thing .
this is also necessary to reco@@ gn@@ ise , if you are strict against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence against the military police are del@@ etes with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ al course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ un@@ du@@ str@@ alization of For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso included almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba for the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the People &apos;s Community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as a Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were added to the sugar cane factories .
after developing the sugar cane industry , the sugar cane industry was quiet , and the factory lost in and after its annex@@ es , until only the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some variety the work .
others signed and comm@@ end daily to factories that are grinding yet .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an that is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn &apos;t sei@@ ze his sleep .
he list@@ ened to work in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , which are again in operation , because they have been preserved .
that was something , what he was not expected .
N@@ ene reminds one of them that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would have received the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ s the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
the news would have been a motive for the country some decades , but the poor harv@@ ests are already no re@@ alism .
why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church looked better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity : 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly ever more competitive for the country .
initial idea was to concentrate on the production of the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only allowed the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motifs , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the breeding crisis in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased again approximately one decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the UN , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agricultural Prosp@@ ects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar imports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present day will go down with security in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , talking about the closure of the factory , the word which he is repeated , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ d@@ ents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group .
in front of the first running year , the first letters started .
it was officially written documents that only differ from the parts , which are removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date distinguished .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from there the responsibility was revised and the letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the land had no money as@@ sured for the use of the sugar cane factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , waiting for the retirement in another system , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will , at the termination of the factory , which helped the construction he helped .
with each part , he removed , he removed one of his 31 years of work .
the most advanced industrial sector developed by Cuba and the most important workplace producers was deleted .
in many cases , no alternatives for the work@@ places and services that were generated in the municipalities were created in which they were created .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw as he guaranteed that the factories had no longer run in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the People &apos;s Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al I learned that many things change , but not always the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory ended , or better , when they started , they stopped , they list@@ ened to asphalt , these dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not serve for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harv@@ ests bring a rap@@ es@@ cent of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin @-@ colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is no re@@ trac@@ ted person , yet he gives the lies , which one told him , not .
they have been tor@@ tured him for ten years .
N@@ ene comes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is missing at power , but because he is im@@ it@@ ated .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they are doing with Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an Tour , workshop manager mobile electronic studios direct to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were headed by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ d@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in northern Quebec , with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop thus raises that the young participants in talks issues such as &quot; cultural identity , language , con@@ frontation , love , self acceptance &quot; or what they always come into the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organ@@ ise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of Tr@@ änen , &quot; a road section in West@@ can@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered .
the cases have mostly not been clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate , as important the ob@@ taining of traditional customs and customs despite the glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song we recorded Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation , the refra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people involved a little help from Gary J@@ olly of the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop Group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the st@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like , nobody ever would like to be interested in me
but I try to go on earth my days on earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we lost our way to live in life
but I believe that we will raise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
thus they can grow and advance to our youth

in Japan one can see plastic courts in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , what is exactly on the menu , will be exhibited in the proximity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( de@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic models of meals &quot; ) provided by any food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers see this plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue to enter the restaurant .
there is a whole industry that dev@@ otes itself to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes made by the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually found that they don &apos;t even need them any more . however , a new trend turns them today in show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic dishes made mobile tapes as they will be shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ ten harv@@ esting objects , such as in this case , cooling control mag@@ nets :
here are a few sho@@ ot@@ ings cabinet mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom in dining tables is becoming increasingly complicated .
in this case a ka@@ olin @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use for the tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) .
we have also made this part to the Tokyo Station .
and here is a apple who pe@@ eled your mobile phone :
designed to view as a apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the coming .
some mobile support and cell designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and sal@@ mon are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some user had their doubt :
is there anyone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with sal@@ mon . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appeti@@ te form to surprise your colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile support has the shape of mel@@ odi@@ ac ice .
furthermore , we are also traveling balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and palm bands from dried sal@@ mon .
further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the H@@ ash@@ tag # , &apos; , &apos; , &apos; , &apos; .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight in the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of fighting drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media over the not@@ orious &quot; struggle against drug traffic@@ king &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ sts and cereals regularly appear in statistics . however , these reflected not the extent of human tragedy , which brings together to this battle .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ mán , the b@@ oss of the Sin@@ al@@ oa box , pushed the stories of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , someone looks for the g@@ rief or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind each cor@@ ks , behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose w@@ ounds will never be healing .
therefore , the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug traffic@@ king &quot; ) , this victims is to give a voice and t@@ elling stories of people who cul@@ min@@ ated in the struggle between the pen@@ al persec@@ utions authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as :
organized crime shall not only be afraid to fear our lives .
the effects are much pro@@ found .
for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers , and all communities have to travel so many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how fears life &quot; ) tells you exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who se@@ eks every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father in only one day , their four brothers , their husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare us again to the task which we have asked to get rid of and after the graves , according to the people who we loved we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should return again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , for I am now with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my Father , but they don &apos;t get paid out because they demand a certificate .
where should we get this ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just have the faces of those who want fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must show the international community of conflicts , breaking down and state guidance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
KY@@ HB , a reader from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state Guer@@ r@@ ero in Central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never consider as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with illness and sens@@ ation journ@@ alism now for several years .
I &apos;m coming every day of newspaper c@@ ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which actually come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from files from specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I feel the feeling , as if I am the only one or sad . it works , like a lack of respect for the person who once became one of these bodies .
I cannot be equal , or consider this as normal .
it continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin think that he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; Lab@@ ours &quot; of the perpet@@ rators when they go through the streets .
for me it is , when they have lost ones who lost someone , and those who have fear , even so something happened .
I see our weakness when stories will become blo@@ oming in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village thus jus@@ ti@@ fies that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they &apos;re trying to speak , that they should be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they are not stir and quiet@@ ly .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four Mon@@ t@@ elling in the Capital District : &quot; it describes a family with threats from their business until they did not only destroy the business until the end of the month , it was not only destroyed by the business , but also their family apart .
you think about everything you &apos;ve lost and remember how many people can change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain on it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains high , the fear is high , if you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
we are further away from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want to be arrested others , because they don &apos;t know when they will lead or kill you .
I didn &apos;t ask myself in these fri@@ ght@@ ful days , but the reply is no , but the reply is no , because I &apos;ve forgotten , how to cry out , I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the Contri@@ bution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence signed by violence . &quot;
he raises questions on how : who car@@ es about the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he rel@@ ates that he had to teach himself like an egg , potatoes br@@ oth , tortillas warm and &quot; Ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vi@@ pers with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left B@@ one - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and learning to live .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that ended his childhood .
his childhood was over two years ago , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloo@@ dy bear was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was born this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city of the world based on the number of murder according to the Council of public security and the Government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosec@@ ution was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul &apos;s soul .
only few stories live in view of always new head@@ lines . this project remin@@ is@@ cent of those who cannot forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ tico was launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , its goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffic@@ king , which the country has tor@@ tured in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r user Nik@@ las Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages which he linked , contain images , on which violence is depic@@ ted .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to lift up a rum@@ or or counter@@ feit a f@@ ake .
but what is the year after something di@@ pped the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it was used irre@@ versi@@ bly used to have trage@@ dies , which actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - does not den@@ ying the fact that there are pl@@ enti@@ ful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures at news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank @-@ wagons crossing the village S@@ ange on the east of the DRC , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came into life .
after the civil war , Africa had become ne@@ gl@@ ected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths of stro@@ kes , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank fell victim to the tank .
officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a movie the@@ aters in the vicinity , which was full of people who knew the soccer world championship .
houses conc@@ e@@ aled and tast@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets .
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the grey scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of hol@@ low body , which on the ground are infl@@ ated during persons .
but here the story cannot find her end .
more than the years ago the same photo was en@@ du@@ ed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but not true for the related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the coastal towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
they reported dras@@ tically reported by atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and stores were burnt down and glu@@ ed in roads and bones .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained to include cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an hab@@ it@@ ant to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ time can be illustrated .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the armies in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and trying to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am in the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture of the DR Congo appears again , as evidence was fal@@ si@@ bly presented to the fact and the possible extent of attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ sil@@ ly use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of dys@@ functions ; Africa Check has documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image has been applied as a cover for mass import .
another step further bring personal comments like this example from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange has also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash statement , published by the United Nations , those who could flee pun@@ ches , ra@@ pe and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts reported like the following that these descriptions were gathered with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi @-@ Arabian news page , which was fal@@ si@@ bly claimed by President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein . in addition , mon@@ ks and politicians would have been involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations that AFP had called their source as their source , however , had not attributed his testimony , but did not allow the image from the DR Congo to be associated .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ plings go back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can be reached . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 18,@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images found that they are very similar to the DR @-@ DRC image .
they come from a mixed leaf@@ let of private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications , and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have false reports ro@@ uted , persec@@ uted others have tried to disc@@ ern the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have brought examples for the ab@@ used usage and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they had been published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we want to show the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the countries listed below ( those in some cases were also linked together ) several examples of mis@@ used use .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely up ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
example of false cou@@ pl@@ ations of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ ch@@ aired countries refer to sites or servers , via the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ cons are still available .
the countries in grey are examples , according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit banknotes .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a Th@@ reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this post , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only ren@@ ame the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo to Nigeria with Nigeria as well as further questions after the intention of individuals and the trage@@ dies ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; EN Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cris@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quoted as his source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although not known whether the original report has the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ films after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this here , used the image from the DRC to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam . &quot; they have clearly seen no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which contra@@ dict this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the incorrec@@ t use of the painting since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , by a post of US American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .

this asser@@ tion was ref@@ uted by a Greek fact check @-@ page 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
an Association of Students of The@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims over the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustr@@ ate the picture of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photograph of the DR Congo was divided as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
in Malaysia , there are two extreme examples for a mis@@ sil@@ ly use of the DR Congo , with a twe@@ et from the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand a blo@@ g@@ gers that are persec@@ uted , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted to del@@ ig@@ i@@ tim@@ ize , since the photos were mis@@ sil@@ ently used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
in Myanmar , the government of Myanmar released a correc@@ t@@ ling news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot;
this correc@@ t@@ ness which only appeared in English only includes references to counter@@ feit images of rum@@ ors who are using H@@ ate Speech and encouraged by extrem@@ ist groups to kill Muslims and elsewhere ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; F@@ Х@@ р@@ и@@ с@@ и@@ л@@ о@@ м@@ и@@ л@@ о@@ м@@ и@@ л@@ о@@ н ? &quot; ( Christian@@ op@@ ho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , which established itself at members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly knew that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT in@@ scri@@ bed to Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page summar@@ ised that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein had been involved in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained therein .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on the students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Kath@@ oli@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image has not been drawn by the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it &apos;s a &quot; similar @-@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to disp@@ ose links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ thin y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns the world sleeping ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion under Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the stop to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that communities found these events , the presum@@ ed of Islam@@ ist &apos;s behalf , a major attention .
United States , 2015 .
the image has been wit@@ nessed as proof for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with no religious context were taken out in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( English ) , 2014 .
after a message was written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , translated into circulation , translated the discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and explained it for fal@@ ter .
from the embassy in which the DR had been contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ inet Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os would be dist@@ ressed .
there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in addition to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( at the folder in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye has likewise been trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared after the original accident of 2010 , the picture is ultimately a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that passes these posts . the first frame focused on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the testi@@ moni@@ als of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the aff@@ ord@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life has been assessed compared to a European or French life .
Religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it &apos;s worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can &apos;t give these images longer .
with social media , there are seventy people affected by the un@@ intended share , the water is around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ row@@ ed it the real hor@@ ror of what actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the prolifer@@ ation of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( e.g. , for example ) .
a argument is that the re@@ tention of pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al is equivalent to the tragedy . sometimes these images are even en@@ du@@ ed by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that non@@ violent screen@@ shots and spectators will take their ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who sought how violent media work to help others ) .
while there are a lot of discuss@@ ing non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
technolog@@ ists experim@@ enting with algorithms in order to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they are thoroughly thinking about situation in which a picture is suggested , but what actually can be solved from the context or completely mis@@ used species .
any inquiry of false supplements should also take into account as internationally as internationally .

photographs by Andy Sim@@ mons are used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. unnecessary ) ende@@ avo@@ red to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( e.g. the Spanish s@@ wir@@ l ) .
but everyone resist@@ s st@@ ub@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient , why complete explanation and sometimes a bit context are required to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have already been collected for a full time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog , one finds the words of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :

how Sri Lanka starts the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state Sri Lanka is currently the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
triggered by the Mon@@ sun , usually in late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ ro O@@ ya came into 15 districts in the south and west of the country on the shore .
after an opinion from Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were killed because of the flight and slu@@ dge @-@ win@@ ches .
over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe reservations .
the ra@@ inf@@ all took place on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the resi@@ due in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene disp@@ arities of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos provide an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka , deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the cat@@ astrophe of cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lanka k@@ ill@@ ong floods die the den@@ gu@@ ef@@ er crisis , war@@ n the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on the road .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the floods , water level up to 6 metres . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also over@@ floo@@ ded due to the waters of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue activities and five are finished for transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organisations and start@@ ups have also been provided to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Desk@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood control and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all those who want to don@@ ate dry food and li@@ ve@@ able goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this area .
the tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data using the help of the app to be informed about Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum .
last year after the cat@@ astrophe of Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , pick@@ Me led a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button to call it users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up service and donations . these were then forwarded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ian Red Cross .
they also led an &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful bo@@ oting transactions for up@@ stream and land@@ slide introduced people .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas , with which several social media platforms are fully exhau@@ sted , will bring residents in need in security and aff@@ ord assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is the long way up to restoration of norm@@ ality .

photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib Gh@@ azi .
use licensed t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love gir@@ l@@ friend .
I trust my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in which one minute we call for the rights of women &apos;s rights .
in the next step , we have rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the ic@@ onic image of a woman with head cloth high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ating par@@ oles vs. Islamic hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend look forward to and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already run these entertainment .
people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years , let me know - the Sah@@ ar , which they know , from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslim , &quot; which had established itself in their performance .
they are mus@@ cul@@ tiv@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all alike .
we are practic@@ ing our religion .
we identify us to be a Muslim but in different kind of art . but somehow we are plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective performance when Muslims , as soon as I cannot fit , rep@@ lic@@ ated there .
Ent@@ mus@@ li@@ zed are being kidn@@ apped
I don &apos;t stand alone .
that &apos;s even the poet that poetry is selling most famous in America : Rum@@ i .
what images are one in the sense when one th@@ inks of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I am it , he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea , the religion became er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a big part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the induc@@ tive images of Muslims , Western books have been colonial since centuries .
this temp@@ ting picture language is determined by the dark man that should be afraid and the exotic woman who should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ compos@@ es the history behind these pictures .
but these pictures are also continued today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to talk about it .
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty scar domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that led to nine Muslim women to present their countries during the last three decades , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential campaign .
this nar@@ rati@@ ves to reco@@ gn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are hin@@ dered , their head@@ shot in public buildings and forced Saudi Women to be forced to cover their entire body , which are both tw@@ ined with two sides of the same medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group practic@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women to lead the movements of change .
it is beyond that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American territory of Afri@@ cans , which were brought to slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has deeply sum@@ mon@@ ed our collective imagination and def@@ ective that Sik@@ h @-@ men and children are aim@@ ing to attack tim@@ us@@ al attacks and sn@@ ik@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to these stories we tell you and because of the kind , in which we tell her , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the 1.7 billion members
in the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rative , helping us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my industry has failed to fail to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims make the highest level of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim populations are African @-@ like Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation which come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my parents came to live in New York in order to live their American dream .
my mother laid their first jewellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made by the Muslim , American St@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan &apos;s new Sky@@ lines saw the world , my parents were un@@ w@@ ounds Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ w@@ ounds Muslims and American ?
sometimes , when people ask people , why I don &apos;t speak pi@@ g seeds , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or bear my hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fly , whom all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ p@@ ale W@@ utz &quot;
I j@@ okes , we do not bear all hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs with us .
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and religious activists who ende@@ av@@ our@@ able to fight widespread lies over Islam .
these lies will be produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islamic machine , think tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information , which is already a Muslim ; or which Islam is mis@@ manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in more than just one stran@@ gers whose wife r@@ ushed the head .

I want to explain this .
I was born to Muslims , but a Muslim Brotherhood was born until I was four years old when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
when social scientist describe religious life , they interven@@ e to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my musc@@ ular faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would see my neighbour , my rock in the fire that I am Muslim when I could see Muslims through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
it would see the evening rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I see them in my arms cra@@ dle , and its Arab verses to protect the basket and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat every one of them three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see , and evil which can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my musc@@ ular faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

Muslims must be Muslim to speak the prayers that she had said to me if I have a bad day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be there as they have taught me to refer to God , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a people who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a nation , created by an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which founded a company with the name of hon@@ our@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ des @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims means to know that in the past two centuries , Europeans have been colonial themselves to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an American Muslim means to know that the suicide in the veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy sum@@ mon@@ y the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the history is reported four times more than a story with a white assassination .
it means that , four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was created by a fre@@ ed black slaves under the name of Bil@@ al .

it is a wrong and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arab@@ s and Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs that we throw to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists presented the North@@ western university participants showed scientifically un@@ true image and bes@@ ought them to assess groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation , which we have to lead
we are deeply dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; others &quot; .
we are going back decades to reco@@ gn@@ ise the roots of our fears and the incorrec@@ t and dangerous imaging expression , which we ste@@ ady in our news aud@@ itors .

initiative for stor@@ yt@@ elling wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ elling , by Flick@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility , here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone to enter in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , the founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is a possible response to stories in their original language .
global Vo@@ ices reported about another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ man@@ age@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are held in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite small languages will not be distributed to the children born there .
the project is valid for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we need cities to assume diversity , safe rooms , in which inhabitants must not forget to be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often , to understand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events take place instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate the listening to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers ask their story in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the Particip@@ ants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dedication and their presentation do so that the audi@@ ences can be followed .
they call laughter and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou conven@@ es also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of nar@@ rative art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the Rab@@ bit and the p@@ avi@@ an in the language of Zimbabwe :
after having explained the meaning of its F@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience , which does not understand her language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ as@@ p he shares his feeling of included :
they have heard it !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
to date , the events of the Treasure Language stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand that from the project , you can contact T@@ LS in contact to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for public debt by the USA in Puerto Rico
with the aim of a new investigation of the public debt of Puerto Rico , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration . the march started in the capital city of San Ju@@ ans , until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ orium de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Citi@@ zens for the Neur@@ onal Deb@@ t of Deb@@ t ) and the Ec@@ umen@@ ical Church of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ ession of the re@@ aring of the deb@@ ts have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Puerto Ric@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for politicians , b@@ än@@ kers and government agencies , who are responsible for deb@@ ts for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand financial examination and a management board without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions adequate compensation , which acts in favour of the economy .
we will press and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt , which is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ c@@ ling pension payments .
we demand instant measures .
the island - not in the state of State of the United States - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a government @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed by the outside without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens are being able to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration carried out the name &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian WEB@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ KLE@@ R Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been operating since over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , supporting his supporters and relatives of the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions that he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , will focus on the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ ühl@@ ing , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , published excer@@ pts from the book &apos;s Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective descendants ) .
the book , which was published last year and licensed , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it &apos;s a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
this book wants to discuss how to create movements for Free knowledge and what the true costs are associated with which this is associated .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in movements for Free knowledge have side to look around the ne@@ b@@ ula who gives our news@@ feeds and create something sense from our various experience .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the A@@ dra prison directory , which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introductory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that wants to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , has many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , mi@@ racles and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose us ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporary belie@@ fs ?
the WEB@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ KLE@@ R for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in detention of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a Gh@@ azi , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Military Police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; served as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military tribunal taken from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gh@@ azi reported that , on 12 November 2015 , they had been contacted by persons who set up himself as the in@@ sider of the Assad regime and made them by an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in the Internet and to know access to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ olog@@ ian and currently sur@@ passed the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes were predic@@ tive as the work which he began with a group of arch@@ ae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , around the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and are mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ ding traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after having started working with this work , the IS would present all of that architecture , which em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike in the digital arch@@ ae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule created for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not un@@ lock this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a Gh@@ azi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life to dream , from freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel , taught me to emb@@ race her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English at , even when he was already imprisoned in prison .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he always has his knowledge with each other , who asked . he taught other incar@@ n@@ ated English to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened my gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also brought other detention , like it is using computers , at least theore@@ tically without knowing it in their hands .
Gh@@ azi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a test book which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
she bra@@ ve the lyrics to him when they visited him , and translated them from the Arab into English .
the book is licensed @-@ free .
book envelope by Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens at each visit ,
that I understand in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
I lose the cont@@ empl@@ ation in the moment , in which we emb@@ race us ,
that each of the d@@ angers doesn &apos;t matter ,
everyone of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ack@@ les and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the pris@@ ings of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I bear with passion at myself ,
when your eyes say Le@@ be@@ es
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to recover all the moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I persu@@ aded myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bas@@ sel , Gh@@ azi wrote :
a year goes , my soul
during all
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bass@@ els history is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , since the protests in 2011 , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) has disappeared more than 65@@ ,000 people .
those who were arrested or arrested under the regime , were tor@@ tured or executed by the regime .
until 2016 , according to the International Human Rights Organisation of Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calls for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today , we are repe@@ ating our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : a post @-@ corruption director for corruption resum@@ ed .
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted to a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his prison sentence on which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants because of inde@@ struc@@ ted resulting from 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , the council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his re@@ setting into the company , which happened on April 19 , then .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which claims the application , there would be no obst@@ acle course for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to res@@ ume his old post , because the company had no disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants are not good .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short CIP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the company &apos;s decision to establish the director :
provides a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and even a back@@ step in regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as CIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we &apos;re aware that the company would have to discipline a disciplinary procedure against the infr@@ ing@@ ement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company was silent , however , and promp@@ ted no appropriate legal steps for applying the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior , and considers the case as &quot; contra@@ dic@@ tory &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent owner , he would be a consultant , after having been sentenced to prison , half of which has been inj@@ ected .
he could maintain lectures and mo@@ tivating talking , he could advise and his image polishing .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has decided to re@@ integrate it into the company that helped save damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is to be paid for his silence .
resist !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and a student of political science in Brazil , says the director no moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded from the state because he didn &apos;t believe it , that someone re@@ compens@@ ed for such a way that the state has grown mas@@ sively .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als and serve to serve as a state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only managed the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was used the state , as hand@@ ele became an in@@ ex@@ haus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become we@@ ary , the re@@ charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t preferred it to re@@ mind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison quarters of Sam@@ ora and will not only remain as the first independent president in Remembrance , but also as sharp , trimm@@ ing and - side by saying - Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous illustrations was , when he vig@@ or@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being , too , is the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious human being changes , my experience shows that which is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he doesn &apos;t turn from his ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious human being crimin@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were dis@@ continued :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he sat down 10 years and was free .
and today it is setting up the firm , in which he po@@ uring money to contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ v@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - B@@ loc@@ ation@@ ally bred &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ ra@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blo@@ cked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to un@@ fair
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age b@@ usses .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net , because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although more about the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adj@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese Scripture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements gave the word to an extremely ab@@ usi@@ ve conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the efforts to fight hate language in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaning@@ ful content on its platform .
the &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word does not call automatically hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , or dou@@ b@@ ts for the use of his use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese , also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends on spiritual nature , if they knew how he could use his back pain by doing a word game .
the proposition ku la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( ku ) + the word face ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - res@@ embles a rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ euer is the opinion that she will reduce the hate language of radical nation@@ alists , but also st@@ ressing that Facebook analy@@ tic must be analytical before spreading out all of the po@@ sts , to spread rac@@ ism .
Facebook is del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ tor@@ ook .
what it should do instead , analyse the mail carefully and check it by using the coming words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( sp@@ age ) .
the good thing is that this dirty nation@@ alists , the hate language , will receive a pretty good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circum@@ cise its nation@@ alism .
while the action is able to send a strong signal to everybody , the hate language , the efficiency of this strategy will not be long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often become a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative write of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described like Facebook started out how Facebook wanted to delete his friends when he would only tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that blo@@ cked the word .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and it was forbidden to me , post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post has not been dis@@ ast@@ rous to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts from humans which have no negative inten@@ tions or simply try their views against hate talking radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate language :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are po@@ or@@ ly bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have been done before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes a beneficial intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
one such words can only be disp@@ at@@ ched by more hat@@ red within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they started without local context or technical support , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they didn &apos;t tried mistakes , they did not tried to report fal@@ sely deleted po@@ sts .
if only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , they would have a big turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of lots of sp@@ ott amongst users .
instead of taking it seriously , users can now feel funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts who played no hate language , but nevertheless removed :

in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate violence in social networks , violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in addition , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disper@@ sions between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed on his bur@@ ial sites on his bur@@ ial sites , Facebook , for his failure .
but instead of using the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better to look for context than on the context of concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ready with children
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s journey is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanimously decided to offer a law that should provide practice so that the married age is 18 .
before this amendment to the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es , some members of Hin@@ du@@ ist and Muslim religious denom@@ inations were gathered in practice . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , a group representing the representatives of various religious groups of the country , that the state was not inter@@ ming@@ led because the state does not include the maturity . &quot;
this happened im@@ min@@ ated the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Rights Convention , which is min@@ ed for children under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 , Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 percent there were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the German Central Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were competing to abol@@ ish the laws followed for children &apos;s sake , followed on the foot and rejo@@ iced great support . undoubtedly , they give up this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du leader , e. g. had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s sake , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition cat@@ ered for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and some@@ time doubt , if the opposition would not agree to the bill .
but in early 2017 , the bill was decided at the beginning of 2017 - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including one woman ) of the Opposition and an independent who ab@@ stain@@ ed , so that he could be discussed at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would take him to the law .
now only the President of the country must agree to the law and announce the law .
one of the country &apos;s broadcast@@ ers played a status @-@ update on Facebook which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against children before the children &apos;s House was approved by 35 votes in the House of Repres@@ entation .
after being decided in the Senate , the draft now can be applied to the law .
the majority of social media user was thr@@ illed , because the laws have finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who fought a minist@@ erial office at the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary c@@ ede , which has shi@@ fted the kernel of the thing , but know what ? the children &apos;s matter is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now and this is worth every prize .
while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status Quo update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e - Thomas , which says : , Excellent News !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz was decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 it is ! ! ! ! &quot;
fol@@ d Mut@@ ota , belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that says quite openly about it , how important is the adoption of the law , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years independent of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the change of marriage was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , 35 of which were present at the vote .
all the dep@@ u@@ ties , which were against the law , have voted for the law .
children above is legally allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Canc@@ er@@ age child@@ care .
many thanks to all activists who have fo@@ amed it .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
several months ago , Mah@@ ar@@ aj announced his intention to stream@@ line judicial steps , should be the law , and he seems to be dis@@ sol@@ ving his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Al @-@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of law , said it was absolutely legi@@ tim@@ ed when Mah@@ ar@@ aj wants to walk towards the law , most social media users , wanted to make the debate differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck about :
Dear Sat , when we say , instead of talking about the discussion , in a way that we would like to talk the state in our bedroom , simply that it may be of big , hard @-@ represented men who are ab@@ used against them , &quot; would you be ready to carry on the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law , or not , these legislation is an important step - however , there are still places around the world , in which children are legal or still the standard , although there is laws which they say .

S@@ agar Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . they were missing with po@@ or@@ ly positioned motifs and balanced colors .
that motivated him a camera to carry and try to gra@@ ve the situation .
at that time he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ agar ende@@ av@@ oured to bring Nept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international scene .
and his home location right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guides attention to Nep@@ tun wildlife .
he described on Facebook as it helps him a first @-@ class situation at his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it give better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I rested just at home , when I suddenly called Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my Father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sau@@ rah@@ a .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was found , and I immediately began to get pictures of k@@ nee ! !
S@@ agar stri@@ ves to close cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ as Nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding of it that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious , as they look like .
and he should know it , because he arose from face to face , saying ,
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b yourself from the opinion of the sheep on sleep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of darkness upon the way home , when suddenly the king &apos;s king appeared , and immediately , we look forward to seeing me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ agar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for Environmental Protection ) on his photos .
its passion for the promotion of Nept@@ as Nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days took it until he had a tiger photograph and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist accommodations .

this entry was written by Kay@@ ser@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a Content @-@ Sharing Convention .
in many parts of India , women avoid greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands , or even older men in the family .
instead , use a p@@ onom@@ ic or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
by Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h until Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to resp@@ ecting the husband , as well as fear of consequences , they should ign@@ ore the norm on life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseud@@ o @-@ court and st@@ ub@@ by her family and the village community after they had addressed a married relatives with names .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition of their wives also do not call upon name , is also distributed among men . however , they have far away less assign@@ ments to fear , if at all , they should not occur . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff , and house@@ wives , a unique club and became the main focus of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they discuss and discuss the enemies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and will be used for the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to prohib@@ iting HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this clubs .
it reports how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and made them simultaneously with amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the wall .
the first video , which showed Roh@@ ini in her discussion round , was unable to call their hus@@ bands on behalf of their hus@@ bands .
it has op@@ ted for this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
the names of their hus@@ bands don &apos;t speak lou@@ dly , is an bre@@ e@@ worthy to keep them guilty and never ques@@ tioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition att@@ ests that a woman must respect their husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t resist it is considered post@@ erior , as woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we never have made us up to this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who also called her husband , had never been called by name , try to try at home , as it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband weigh still long after the video was finished .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , I call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed it was a good cause because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected against all girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving , and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they may call us as they want , that they must not respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day when she brought the name of her hus@@ bands on her lips &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ astra over the breaking of a century @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never promise the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
one woman was so sh@@ y that during the whole practice it was c@@ ashed in front of herself ; a second decided to sett@@ le the whole arm@@ oured fru@@ str@@ ation against him and his family by sending him cur@@ sed .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ st@@ atically .
I think , I will never forget it again .
in addition , in A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ r@@ ausch , with an ancient Br@@ auch , the women decided that they would actually try to call home their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they held their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a woman called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and asked what ideas put them into the head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she wa@@ ited , she got afraid , saying that there was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the trac@@ table of the interest no@@ ber@@ red point on the fore@@ head , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the car@@ cin@@ ating red point when he also took it .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I heard it to carry him to carry him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not heard completely , but my own , they are in a better position to choose it on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at each discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make women looking for , who could hear what , &quot; says , &quot;
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days in their lives with cakes ; they d@@ anced and talked about things that they had never done before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working for so many years in these problems and yet I have made some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands , never said so hon@@ est .
it feels great that certain things can say lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have maintained ourselves about the concept of honour and connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ mon @-@ c@@ ta , a great shirt over a tro@@ users , they don &apos;t have a her@@ b .
after a lot of disputes and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes @-@ selection , mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , shot Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round that women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things come slowly into the roll :
so far , we made only small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then they list@@ ened to tell the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it still , but only if they are alone , and no other family members are involved .
only one or two say still to the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women carry out Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach them in their lives - like thread for greater freedom of movement or own clothes - at the end of a hard to navigate the river .
by giving themselves each other self @-@ confidence , it will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and others talking about what we &apos;re talking and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a new system of the kidn@@ apped people for the organ@@ ists , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , argu@@ ed the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government has now called a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers away from Malawi .
one of the victims were be@@ headed , and some of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and cancelled in the succession that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi are used .

it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks against men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of nar@@ ration for ob@@ sc@@ ure , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN to investigate a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is custom@@ ary in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tions and judi@@ ces .

free Bas@@ sel : ne@@ ti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New n reactions of international community to medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably recently made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published in the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had gained attention in international community , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the hospital .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State endanger@@ ed ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that the democratic reforms in China had been involved .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a speaker tells it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
nonetheless , China will continue to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , friends or a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , other topics are completely destroyed .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
hands R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met in late June , Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Li@@ u Abroad for treatment abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came in stores after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was given to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government had agreed that this was nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year . in June Norway signed a agreement to record the sal@@ mon trip to China , since the exports have been largely blo@@ cked since 2010 .
after the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought up his hope to an unconditional release of expression and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his arrest he was not able to meet his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was promp@@ ted to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as they divided into a statement on 30 June :
we also expect that China raises all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they are to meet and receive all visits to communicate them , and capable of communicating freely with the outside world .
USA and USA
U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that Americans would like to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in@@ so@@ far as it was inviting him to help him . &quot;
a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AFP on 27 June that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities were not only Li@@ u fre@@ iz@@ ul@@ ously , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the response of U.S. Embassy moved to China , with the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country have the right to incorpor@@ ate and un@@ responsible for Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to medical care of its choice , which they have to claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push out Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I need China to give up the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally free to give itself to a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support gets that he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the Reuters news agency , that China had big concerns whether the ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e could sur@@ pass the li@@ bel by Li@@ u .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um , asked China to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to aband@@ on his family .
Li@@ us lawyer , AFP told that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room at the hospital , and that it is not permitted to speak with somebody outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us further :
Canada calls for China , its international human rights obligations , including the freedom of expression , true and the responsibility for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called China in a statement on June 29 , to Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken in order to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , independent of where needed . furthermore , his wife and his family can contact him .
although the news portal France has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , announced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide no further information if France will finally receive him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the stron@@ gh@@ old in Taiwan , called China on June 27 , to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u Fre@@ iz@@ ul@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a bigger tolerance towards those who require peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legis@@ l@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u ur@@ ged from the ruling Democratic Party &apos;s ruling party to allow the sick of intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself very wor@@ ried about Li@@ u and asked him that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well@@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my faith that he had taken , and had kept strictly pun@@ ished , to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and prosper@@ ous China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally very moving and also encouraged , when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and stat@@ eh@@ ood in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem to appear since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to Justice Minister K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of an annual meeting of the State Chamber of the State of New York , the Minister said that many people critic@@ ised the dom@@ ination of the only political party of Singapore , as compared to Singapore with other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be considered as a town .
... nobody is asked to ask whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , where most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice , &quot; The logic to rot@@ ate , &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ ed to create this valuable country , we hear that we had no country .
it is so vul@@ gar , it had the licence of escape before the responsibilities , an obligation injury .
Singapore if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons led by Shan@@ bra@@ g@@ am were not very Nobel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of its , he appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , alike cities which are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the theme , again the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian power of power , giving to the present Democrats leave the ver@@ rot@@ ated logic because it fits better to their power .
in the final week of Shan@@ bra@@ g@@ am , the last week of Shan@@ bra@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ ative , our Political System really Non @-@ Ans@@ wers .
corresponding questions will be covered with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Shan@@ bra@@ g@@ am on his opinion , because they didn &apos;t understand these conclusion .
I personally find a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to what land belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very gr@@ ate@@ ful when our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take on the effort to solve this point , if he was paid up , in order to be part of the government of Singapore .
by announc@@ ing on the blog , he published his comment on the Cri@@ tics that you should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference , in order to better understand the context of Shan@@ bra@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to that Singapore was a town and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said why the elections were so indispensable in Singapore , even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party ? ) .
when he said , Singapore was no land , &quot; he obviously did not gener@@ alise it in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , which makes as leader of a global generation , such as pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what is said by the Minister of Justice of Singapore , ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w and the members of the old Gar@@ de that expects me to agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have dou@@ b@@ ts and I am not even sure that he actually belie@@ veth right and conscious of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review cr@@ ates the weak@@ nesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
does Mr Shan@@ bra@@ g@@ am &quot; has committed a mistake or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ger spokes@@ man ?
if Singapore is no country , we are considered as an independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country go back to the sou@@ so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it &apos;s equally country and city .
since he plays an important role in the government cabinet , the testimony of Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s principal meaning of serious importance .
why is Singap@@ ore@@ an their military service , defend it only their city , but not their land ?
who has to pay our Prime Minister Inv@@ o@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
in the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade , is always a city :
&quot; I have not said what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have expanded many Singap@@ ore@@ an ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more about the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your residence or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and a different fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , which lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is set to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , don &apos;t harm me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on which situation takes place , there is more pol@@ ite to show interest in his talk partner , making personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication , the standard response follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadian cook perhaps in@@ different before anger , if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distinguishes us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadian put up a Canadian flag right at their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American by contrast ... .
so , when I started 20 years ago , the world began to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th of September .
Canadian have always borne small A@@ hor@@ n@@ ets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there is no weapons with us !
the equ@@ est@@ able marri@@ ages are already legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say quite often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is supp@@ os@@ edly considered the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we can@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends , which I ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would not matter if you would like to conf@@ use Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; cute . &quot;
fir@@ stly : as &quot; cute , &quot; means that reason to be sk@@ e@@ tically , sk@@ e@@ zing , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada was really a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem exists in it that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no corners and edges , nothing , at which you can encounter .
harm@@ less , welcomes un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
this may be something good when you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remot@@ ely from the things that happen around one .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main property of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of ourselves only to worry about our own matters .
what out@@ standing as &quot; cute , &quot; is perhaps simply just cool courtesy .
Canadian don &apos;t talk about the fence with neigh@@ bors .
we &apos;re missing the warm @-@ heart@@ ed , open friendliness , which I connect with my American friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au then asked the stage to show that Canadian had more than just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our prime minister has down@@ right sexy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
musical video from a pop @-@ band par@@ ody for Thailand
one in Thailand famous Pop @-@ Band published a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert produced the civilian government in 2014 and , despite its promises , the civil government continues to restore the country .
the new song &quot; dict@@ ator Girl &quot; ( Ph@@ a@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not politically , the music video rel@@ ates to the ongoing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was allocated to Facebook and received 8,@@ 800 L@@ ikes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blo@@ cked in Thailand after a group of activists compl@@ aining the public to watch this video .
you can interpre@@ t the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , such as it del@@ etes with the state of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta .
take a look at the videos of the video , which refers to some of the political topics that Thailand have been prosec@@ uted in Thailand over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives the Commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the host @-@ chief decision @-@ making of important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered a Cri@@ tics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and non @-@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to am@@ end activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and people who were accused of having prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy .
Thailand push@@ es a stri@@ ction to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Authority ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup attempt .
one of the problems which the Jun@@ ta continues to buy their decision , although security experts she war@@ ned that the purchase is unnecessary and waste .
in the video , even as people will be kicked off in a black v@@ ans , before they get into an Inter@@ ni@@ zation camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly c@@ ens@@ ed &quot; confusion &quot; in society and the Internet users are threatened to pun@@ ish the mon@@ archy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song members of the band called the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war company re@@ covers only slowly in Eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ch@@ ava are located in the cy@@ mb@@ als of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Greeks , cat@@ fish , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the biggest part of Rus@@ sians and cat@@ astroph@@ es live in the area .
such sett@@ lements are called in Ab@@ ch@@ asia also called gh@@ ost cities .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirit .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
the total population of 16@@ ,000 people since 2011 , after they had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and falls to him difficult to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I speak with you ? &quot; why speak ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with forbidden spl@@ endor @-@ buildings .
people who once lived in this place and gave their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks like .
K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v &apos;s , which can accommodate one or two families , can be dried to the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look from the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they move immediately .
&quot; our Mother has banned us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers in her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly abandoned it to the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing .
it &apos;s difficult to come about the rounds .
the district administration delivers free candles and bread on the ham@@ lets in winter .

about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ ès , as called them in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to j@@ ell@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left at@@ titudes to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial assistance by her daughter , and in@@ sist@@ ing that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly payments are only 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Mexico &apos;s home &quot; mo@@ m Africa &quot; migrants home to their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
this article by Amy Bra@@ cken is published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org , published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border to Guatemala .
it &apos;s a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ frame and golden @-@ coloured earrings in a t@@ ed@@ dy form .
it is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and has grown there . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) became a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are in transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately 2,50 Dollar night , the guests sleep in simple rooms , with grinding , cr@@ um@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of afri@@ can and Hawai@@ ian migrants coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told the people in full min@@ ib@@ uses and the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; mo@@ m Africa !
where are you mo@@ m from Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have slept well outside on cardboard boxes .
she wants to refuse to any@@ body .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medicines that they can &apos;t pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m coming from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time .
I asked him , if the Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ at@@ ache ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil , and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits perfectly , as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the heart of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston to meet her husband and three children .
they have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans , which are on the way into the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard from other directions from Mama Africa . &quot; mo@@ m Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he told that Hai@@ tian &apos;s and Afri@@ cans often travels the way and that Afri@@ cans speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his way , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as construction workers for construction sites of the Olympic Games and football world championship .
when the Brazilian economy has been we@@ aker , he has started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s future in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother Africa is our mother and we never let them go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez told that her guests are often sending text messages when they continued to gr@@ ate them , or to report about the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much more about Africa , but their guests have taught them to prepare ch@@ ick@@ ens like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps well @-@ known , but it is not the only radio hope to travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a cu@@ l de sa@@ c leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter was Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rant in their little house .
it is polic@@ eman and has noted that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African immigrants .
he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are here , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep on the floor , but at least have they electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests make .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border through the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived there for three years , he was referred to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before men who wanted to press money without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation , and an Un@@ known , a All@@ rounder , has offered her roof .
a few months later , the family lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , the trav@@ ellers consult their phones .
a min@@ ibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez seem happy about that her house is full , but it is also no@@ stal@@ gic , because of them that went away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she looks in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair bra@@ id who have made a demonstration , some photos of her grand@@ children and many trav@@ ellers more , young and old .
she laughs sad , while she pre@@ vent@@ ured to me shortly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya @-@ fu@@ eron , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeated every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang citizens are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobiles .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter @-@ user @-@ managed to ble@@ ach
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their cell phone .
on July 10th , the mobile users in Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile phone alert when they chose the District government to install a surveillance App named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in this communication , the app &quot; will hin@@ ts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to obtain access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they were shortly after they had installed the app , messages using a private We@@ Chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Communication &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Communication &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the App and the distribution paths of terror@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would follow , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities including videos , images , books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs Website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telecom .
the main function is the block por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fr@@ aud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to spend user attention , how much time they spend their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers could manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al it from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages over digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the East and South , the reality is very often ble@@ ak for those who live in remote , op@@ pressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme end@@ ings and surveillance measures , as well as routine sec@@ tioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Media @-@ based Media Out@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ble@@ ach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , the cen@@ sored news in China , displayed photos by a Check@@ point to check the residents either by a check@@ point that they had installed the monitoring app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people are using the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to be forced to use devices for older people .
this is a form of the captivity through the rest watch technology .
we are back back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ble@@ ach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software is able to raise the password needs of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are available in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang on electronic hand@@ rails .
the regulations in j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly minim@@ ize a reaction to the instructions of the city party , to minim@@ ize the dissemin@@ ation of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report of Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published an Regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with all residents and entrepreneurs , up to 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible associations , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political communications .

all the neighborhood des@@ irable , not just my own .
for the first time , it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , for wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city , which until in the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ complic@@ es .
in the third night , things were cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the quarter .
I crossed the silence , by taking several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my Haus@@ d@@ ach .
I heard my voice through silence contra@@ dic@@ ed .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt enough to meet together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends got to me ; we were talking to a gorgeous picture that filled my expectations and fulfilled it all .
in such a moment , you are aware that you have free the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care in the barley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the Military Security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he placed on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ lowed you - nothing can return to your voice from the body until the office of the Security Service from the body .
I joined there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear me as you cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only cour@@ ageous enough , if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his asser@@ ted eyes erected on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re really sad to see me in the eyes , and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I would not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never stopped to watch you into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fat@@ ale consequences for me , and yet I have no word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutes him in single and his father equally with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father equally with him . &quot;
the con@@ stri@@ fe of this curse lie down to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a sec@@ ular torture which I was exposed to months .
I have crossed the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
then again by the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I consider all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise , they have shared a bigger cell in this time .
I have to share them with only one another prisoner , and cannot set me immediately , without waiting for their permission .
after a couple of minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I access to an old @-@ established communication method : to beat his f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ ic Com@@ rade was an &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling . &quot;
after long co@@ hes@@ itation he said to me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a resp@@ ected man middle age that looks like me and &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no prominent facial features can be seen , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone who sounds like my voice like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers broad@@ casts its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ sured me , they would not worry if I stay .
fal@@ g@@ ner .
I &apos;d like to have had a bird fri@@ gh@@ s to distribute all these cro@@ ws , who lab@@ s in the fruit in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the distance , I can still cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 pm in the evening ; always at these time flies the cry , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the color of Ver@@ der@@ b@@ ens is , until I saw the yellow light that so@@ w us in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ es@@ ung on 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to listen . &quot;
thus the secret revealed : to protect the state security ahead of us and prevent the terror@@ ists in us , they say in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - therefore they played their con@@ fession@@ al income card and locked the close perspective of their world view .
this is not a house , which here is no land ; it is a curse whom they call co@@ existence to turn the crimin@@ als of her c@@ lans into a hero .
I entered the inter@@ c@@ eption and tre@@ ph@@ ew on Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender , and a dam@@ aging man ; at least he comes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My boy , you are still young , you are still young , you can join this day to protest and to protest against demonstrations , which will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t answer .
I have acc@@ ust@@ omed it to me , not to answer .
I really cannot tell exactly what matters and impacts after a friendly interview have become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to p@@ am@@ per@@ ed me , though I had to be pun@@ ished , though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
to punishment in all of their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; con@@ fes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker has rejo@@ iced in your cry .
give him a pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you can &apos;t hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough yet , so that they can inter@@ change the tube through a cable .
during my first capture , I asked if the investig@@ ator had been working as a gar@@ bage collector , or if it belonged to normal working facilities .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present ourselves from their view@@ point , great invention of a gig@@ antic cable .
within one hour are three of them sel@@ dom , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any sense in my body - and my voice , why I ce@@ ased to cry .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ jects the cooling , and found no pleasure in it , so he &apos;s next to an electrically loaded staff handle .
electricity through the whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the d@@ oves disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had already fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must probably have been around midnight .
I decided to lay me back again ; let &apos;s say , that &apos;s my only option .
a few hours passed , who came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens up and the morning light ful@@ fills the room . &quot; R@@ out with you , as@@ sh@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering with the voice of an ex@@ haus@@ tive yo@@ ungst@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be wor@@ ried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk away , you will move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always set me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speaks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoke a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b divi@@ des the most of his time inside : he turns his screen to his computer , and again to his couch .
what to leave , however , is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his nic@@ otine to discover lips .
he lives in the top@@ most of his family house which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel had completed his occupation of the West@@ bank , and H@@ da@@ ib@@ s family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where she lived as a fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
for more than six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist involved in the conservative majority and their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , often involved with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian certain@@ ties , he calls on the core of the whole Arab world . all of these topics do not only find in his hom@@ etown , Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities committed to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits , and he can feel the devastating results of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it does not open it , it does not get a special ascent against the US @-@ American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe his compassion for those who try to do in war areas , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian po@@ res of the second generation , &quot; he himself also called himself , even if he was born in Jordan , and never before Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own hab@@ itats , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I sh@@ ook a man , &quot; while he dissolved in water in two cups , it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in that time it is intended for Muslims from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b apparently has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; otherwise a cup of coffee has to do little with protest against Islam .
basically the hose speak warm coffee and the sw@@ elling of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan is like a prison under the free sky , especially when taking a look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it &apos;s easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an &apos;s water , to be not able to so@@ den in prison .
recently , the interior of Jordan has cancelled its appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary debates which support the Muslim Brotherhood - the Muslim branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ing that sexual orientation of the country &apos;s hom@@ osex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ ar@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dict the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert of the country .
in an interview with CN@@ N , the member of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that had been said to be cancelled due to sexual orientation of the death sentence .
many claim that the band &apos;s commitment in matters of affairs , such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and free opinion in the Arab world , be dangerous activ@@ ism , which constitutes the old legi@@ tim@@ acy of author@@ itarian reg@@ imes in the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimates the Jord@@ anian nation as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to stand for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may be not just a just @-@ sided rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan contra@@ sted that in H@@ da@@ ib@@ s work clearly appears .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b lost traditional gender nor@@ ms that formed his vision from the fate of Arab women , the vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the painting shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously un@@ familiar woman , their arms , legs and legs can be loaded up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust .
in Jordan , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary de &apos; increased the un@@ official outside in Jordan .
human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016 . however , the number of honorary infrastructure is missing , however , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on the und@@ breaking control of 1954 , women who are accused of violence in jail , &quot; and for their release is often required for a year @-@ long bureauc@@ ratic expend@@ it@@ ures , as well as the guarantee by the family , that the woman will nothing happen .
H@@ da@@ ib@@ s music enjoys great popularity and is known to rever@@ t many themes that are g@@ assed in his country long as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , that he doesn &apos;t agree his music , the full of explic@@ it attack on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
to me politics was di@@ min@@ ished , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question after the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically politically , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repeat itself often :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it too . &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get in his words , &quot; that &apos;s what you want &quot; - be it faith or failure , H@@ etero@@ gene@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , saying that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still have been cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn in the context and cen@@ sored his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet of the eighth century , still remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ vo was supposed to work on behalf of the potassium , in the eighth century , in the eighth century , Jord@@ an@@ ians could not be able to write it ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new that government attacks against free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service adopted several former government officials and members of the teachers , having responded to the problems in social media , they had critic@@ ised corruption in their deeply ro@@ oted in the country .
in view of what &apos;s the concert H@@ da@@ ib@@ s , only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to have a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for the second time in a row , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a will now make a performance for him , but the way of progress - this is how it looks slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . it is sure that this change from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society will take place .
there were H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s , also from an Arab world without interventions abroad .
he does not only dream to bring his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also among them , &quot; they are experiencing . &quot;
perhaps the region , together with music , art and literature is a real and fundamental op@@ enness , and not by bom@@ bs , spreading uni@@ tions and on artificial nature . at least he hopes that .
until it is so far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to shed and consequently make resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man belongs as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are as fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories as regards the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
one presum@@ ed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory has been delivered and out of a time , in the army mar@@ ched by the West Japan in the northeast , around the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the k@@ nee .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to sn@@ ap a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( lit@@ t@@ l .
I have long been looking for my long time again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two fort@@ resses are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people , who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and another way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high feast was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care were so important as in this story , because they help to promote Peru@@ vian youth from Crime and promote a legi@@ timate profession as the hair@@ dressing .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near Lima &apos;s historic center - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drugs day are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services to men .
the trend , appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ dos by famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Guer@@ r@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , who can still find more normal citizen in the experienced hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers who can form these elabor@@ ate hair@@ dos .
the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ dos who go to the utmost limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts to show each other to show , who can create the ex@@ entr@@ e L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( see further videos of current competitions there are public Facebook profile bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , found here an opportunity to exchange young people of them to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad ratings , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the self @-@ looking possibilities have seen dozens of you@@ ths that they can sei@@ ze a profession , which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in the beginning of March to report special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district that we are very proud because of love to the children we built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of &quot; Liebes@@ mess@@ enger &quot; to gu@@ err@@ illa war , &quot; which released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who know ?
is it not much more import@@ antly , people who encounter with aff@@ ection to aff@@ ection ?
this question was exactly the young col@@ om@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the &quot; Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( Brief@@ ing for Recon@@ ciliation ) , the young people ex@@ h@@ orted to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters letters .
only recently , her country scene was the country of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the Guer@@ il@@ la@@ motion F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Colombia ) concluded the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was meant to mark the Nobel Peace Treaty as a result that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions .
however , before Colombia is still a long way , until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
Guer@@ r@@ ill@@ ak@@ ens , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to one of war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock had to integrate their weapons in life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company again , which had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hat@@ red , must now record it into their ranks and support them during construction of a new life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cris@@ tian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convinced that the young Colombia would join together and help in integrating the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly what did they do : even thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign will be 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who then to be personally signed .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was held at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we love the people who love thousands of love letters , but those who don &apos;t forget it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said he continued to share his love with people this year , most of the most urg@@ ently needed .
thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who now must find their place in society and will show up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , in the context of the campaign more than 2000 letters were collected .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I would never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a United Nations warehouse in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art , in order to bring the letters to personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves as they did previously did to meet the commands of their leader .
but this time they received no commands , but letters full of sub@@ s@@ war@@ eness from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings come through a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that between lies , &quot; told the policy student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of the District of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , I brought me a former fighter from the camp of Guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ err@@ illa @-@ car@@ bure@@ tor live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something .
I had afraid to go down , because beside him a man was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ rower , a deadly weapon in the village of Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a letter that someone written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life Some@@ thing has written me something like this , so I am looking forward to it . &quot; I suddenly ran t@@ ears over the che@@ eks .
I thoroughly emb@@ raced him , and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ rower .
perhaps he was praying , it was sorry , all the years of faithful companions of this struggle , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never seen anything else from life as war . he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I would never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
now I &apos;ve learned to learn how I must deal with weapons .
but now where peace is reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came into a discussion round .
the students had grown up , as already war , and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC outlines the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced the opportunity to develop a political party , we can contribute to a political party to create the society in this country .
to overcome this magn@@ itude , it pays out to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was impressed :
these people have never found obe@@ dience , yet never found obe@@ dience , and to recognize that people , which I often have seen as monsters , and even hate people , who were turned over by their hab@@ itats and their environment was pain@@ ful for me .
the reality , in which the land lives , h@@ urt me .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who killed , and so much damage , can give us something , and a smile and a hu@@ g can give us .
many former mil@@ it@@ ants answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
in Colombia , Colombia became clear that after dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is im@@ bal@@ dness , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack and take up for their rights , and this is completely justified ( ... ) .
now we use the F@@ ARC on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ide@@ ology , they belong to all those that dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our post and bring sacrifice , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple , who will defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be forth@@ coming .
on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international lines after several months after reports were published , which were subject to the deteri@@ oration , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ y Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who susp@@ ect que@@ er men and took them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a transaction , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was raised , you consci@@ ously became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so that she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ es had experienced by the sexual intercourse her coun@@ try@@ woman , hunting was opened on Sab@@ rina .
from fear to her life , she moved to the United States last time .
Sab@@ rina : I was working on a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ lu@@ de that tast@@ ed into trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone , of whom I thought , he would be a friend of my documents , and spread them everywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he would be no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents went through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App to the round .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just a few shopping gu@@ arded from my car , I heard of my voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned up@@ swing , I felt anything in my body , but me didn &apos;t h@@ urt me .
then I heard a sentence , but this time on ch@@ anc@@ echn@@ ical : &quot; how long will you still escape the family , you sh@@ and@@ ro@@ eck ? &quot;
I knew the person .
I know only that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and last final du@@ des in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had to get caught and started sh@@ out .
the man was bra@@ i@@ ded .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two m@@ unden in my right lung s@@ wing .
OC Media : in which patient experiences were placed - in men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name , but the physician got up and put me to the women .
I am very gr@@ ate@@ ful for him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian Name .
but he turned out as a good person .
I am gr@@ ate@@ ful for him that he has gone resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
I got drug threats last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some perfectly unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ fall .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
the required time to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they asked the absur@@ d demands : some said me , I &apos;ll prove it , going on top without through the streets ; others wanted to change my sex in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and I say that all my sex had not changed , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how does your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some elderly people said once my mother in the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which does not only have your family , but the whole republic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t stir you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she laid a sn@@ are about the neck .
fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window got a car with dark wind@@ shield and a numbered sign with a 95 @-@ dr@@ on .
after that happened for the third time , I was clear that there was something f@@ au@@ l .
my human rights friends check out the number@@ ing plates - it presented itself that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you bra@@ i@@ ded ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I say that I remember them all . they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something unbelievable .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without register without notice , without notice .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
came and check@@ ered to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card on my mobile phone .
at the moment when I call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe it in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you are plug@@ ged . you even know your room number .
just to prove you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , however , this is a tab@@ oo topic .
I still tra@@ ge some traditional delicious elements still in me .
so , I wish to overcome this spiritual barrier , I cannot overcome this barrier .
I say always that , as long as my mother is in life , I will do my best to in@@ viol@@ ate them .
when we ch@@ att@@ ed with camera , I actually give me trouble , like the person who remember them out of their past - so on my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who has entered into Ar@@ gun one half months .
he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an , he was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he decided not a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
so , my I , they probably invite you to worry about the problem with the affected person and at the end there is proof that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; has experienced in the blood of satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still pregnant men now in these secret words ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says , there is just not many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , above all those who have not a rich relatives or who were dropped from their relatives to place Kad@@ y@@ rows dish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as I know , they are kept there as terror@@ ists can present it later than terror@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and asser@@ t , they have attacked a village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people would not have disappeared , but specifically sub@@ mer@@ sible , to radic@@ alize .
OC Media : is this now only a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;m just someone who had been det@@ ained in Ar@@ gun one half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
there were nothing new of them since .
they simply have taken her .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was , when these people were taken along .
but now they were not presented as Band@@ its , but there were no reports about it . we argu@@ ed that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise did you not allow it to sh@@ ave this man ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and demonstrations of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always contributed my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think , already before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
serious ! the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civili@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally , it was thrown back into the stone period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted ; I had colored eyelashes , bearing tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria has never touched me only a hair .
before the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and all the city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never ins@@ ult@@ ed .
in the Che@@ chen language , there &apos;s a prec@@ urs@@ or : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means &quot; Sp@@ are not beyond the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often says to children , if they are fun with sick .
OC Media : so just did they keep your eyes closed before you because they believed that you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never stopped me , never f@@ ails , and never struck me .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ age kept ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row joined the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk on television about mor@@ ality .
he didn &apos;t spoke about us by se , but primarily on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , one could notice as the people in the city began to change .
those who had to be learned and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the meantime , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time , when I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily increasing .
OC Media : which activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much too much in the United States .
besides , I &apos;m still working as activ@@ ist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organ@@ ise te@@ et@@ rec@@ ffs , gath@@ er@@ ings , I buried them to hospital and help them to get eating cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
I have discovered these people themselves , when I ab@@ hor@@ red my refuge .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ lied .
so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
that &apos;s exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who wish you with foam before the mouth , that there is no s@@ ails with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ers have which Kab@@ ard@@ ines have which Rus@@ sians have also known ; on all the planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it &apos;s un@@ pleasant to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque , and in the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live with men .
do you know , many think about Tran@@ si@@ denti@@ fied men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ste@@ er .
these are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ation to be precise , different living settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin , and will not be ash@@ amed for my body .
do not know if I have a partner or not .
sorry I am doing so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad about it - I know that I myself am myself .
local groups were before an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi fellowship in Iran
the Iranian ancestors region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months , there is a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ ality .
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ le@@ z .
photo : using permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27th August , the des@@ per@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi fellowship in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Th@@ aw@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he op@@ pressed for his own support to come up to his family , Ah@@ mad@@ azi @-@ Human Rights groups who want to work and remain anon@@ ym@@ ously .
a video held on YouTube kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people were able to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that has been established in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ minority , and activists s@@ war@@ n &apos;t that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ mad azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month , several other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ay@@ Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - recovered .
their stories have a matter in common : they were all family fathers , based on the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ poll@@ uted , to nour@@ ish their families and pursue a safe work .
Arabic Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where much of the Arab citizens living in Iran , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to dispute the native Arab population , its habitat to dispute .
before a century , Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi &apos;s mon@@ archy had taken power and under@@ took considerable efforts in 1925 to finish the ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran next to oil and gas fields as well as some of the tra@@ its and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continue to develop slowly , and the native population gets only little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and dism@@ iss@@ ings .
the Iranian regime rejected the Ah@@ mad azi Arab@@ s systematically work@@ places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of dem@@ bs , built water from the Arab regions to the Persian areas where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are .
these dem@@ ons have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation caused by d@@ rought and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab Ah@@ aw@@ zi @-@ yo@@ ungst@@ ers rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian @-@ General Director for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ mad Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ is who completed elementary school , completed 55 % of the secondary school and 45 % of the university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and r@@ attle @-@ ethnic discrimination , &quot; resulted in a &quot; high rise in the number of self @-@ moral among the young ancest@@ ral men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . the reason is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjusting process :
since functional and institutions pre@@ fers not to support Arabic workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi becomes the access to working possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s , and for@@ cing them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood outside their home ancest@@ or .
there are people who had to change their benefits and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to Ah@@ mad@@ azi , as even Arabic name cannot be toler@@ ated , because speaking of Arabic language or traction of Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances , the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi shall bear , propose human rights activists , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait , whether the world aw@@ ake up and take knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t I identify with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions , in which many different positions came to the expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who refer himself as an inter@@ sec@@ tional Femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonders , why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even place well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for instance , in spite of equal education , women still earn less money than men .
still , that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , when it comes , what body can do with their body .
violence against women is a global epi@@ demic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women so@@ oner or later in various areas of life on a glass ceiling , and that discrimination moves through the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it and I have double and triple them .
I &apos;m a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak of skin color on black tran@@ sid@@ ente women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I say , on what kind of corpor@@ al and verb@@ al movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ aries had to be silent .
nevertheless , however , everyone knows that women - all women should come together to take up their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing , &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to speak that , in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , formed an institutional form , ra@@ ci@@ ously motivated violence , which we have black women to be exposed to two @-@ fold species .
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ ics and men made less deser@@ ve more than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women have under@@ gone a higher risk in black sp@@ ans and women with a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I wish that all men and all men have any skin in any skin . on the other hand , I cannot join me as a black woman , in which the white woman likes to take into account of un@@ righte@@ ous@@ nesses in their thinking , who refer to both gender as well as to the skin color of a person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and won &apos;t be more to fight my citizenship in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which always rejected me and countless other black women and repeatedly .
So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in 1851 in her speech : &quot; am I no wife ? &quot; and I also refused to su@@ st@@ ain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human@@ ized essence .
I refused to join the group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b through cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation of our customs and customs to drive their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric programme .
I will not try to gain white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to disc@@ lose the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are attemp@@ ting to bel@@ isk them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional Femin@@ ism was founded to limit women from different origin , and are still conscious of white femin@@ ism , and is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will draw it off , full and quite from femin@@ ism to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , so st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly is that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it &apos;s more important than ever , that we define black women in our own ideas and we will be created in the spher@@ es that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism , tells us that we can defend ourselves to define our own way in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed to make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality femin@@ ists can be disc@@ arded immediately after they have read these lines , please inform you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dictions of femin@@ ist movement , by which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , because in this par@@ adig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this par@@ adig@@ m thanks to my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this par@@ adig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flo@@ ur@@ ish in an environment , nor ren@@ ounce nor ign@@ ore my life , nor refused .
p@@ add@@ ling against contamination : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports special about international efforts to resol@@ ving environmental issues .
in the framework of a Content @-@ Sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
Nabil Mus@@ a traveled again in the past 7 years - usually with surf board or in can@@ oe - with a special issue through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to make human importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ k@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a to explain his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to its church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river , whom we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all the country believe that the decades of war , the construction of dust dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ man Alliance - which focuses on it , &quot; the rivers , bro@@ oks and water@@ ways in Iraq , and to support local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ k@@ ey , a documentary film in Er@@ bil , in Iraq and edited by multi@@ media journalist , filmed and edited .
the main emphasis of her work is on conc@@ e@@ aled , few considerable sub@@ cultures and new multi@@ media techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed congregations , their stories can tell their way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult struggle against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we@@ eping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bring her pain on women &apos;s mor@@ row in the country and in the region to show their re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the number # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect people affected .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her Ex@@ partner , who could become violent .
since the end of her relationship has spent some time and the police said , her statement would not have to be placed , but more could not do .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was used for mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , also the respon@@ sive display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing .
a few days later , the second wife moved their display .
to break the devil &apos;s violence against women , is difficult .
if women are at all once a ad , they do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases , women also depend financi@@ ally dependent on the men who are mist@@ re@@ ated . this also explains why only 20 % of women who ad@@ mit violence to be victims of violence at all , even with criminal prosecution authorities .
content 1 pun@@ ches and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible failure and a legal system which does not under@@ take part 3 of Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , lack of application and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really har@@ assed , as many women really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various informations and reports , but not even a double @-@ way the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the numbers available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence against domestic violence . 70 % of them went around violence against women .
86 % of the ads came by women .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence among the peace courts . 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were corpor@@ al , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
this statistics , however , show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only a few of these criminal off@@ ences are actually displayed . &quot; for every woman who will be ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of mental failure , 9 women who do not do this .
for every woman being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed for physical mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , two women , which do not do , &quot; stated at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a self @-@ existence , criminal prosecution can not be documented as many women of each year of their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists killed at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
after their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days , a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that does not under@@ take
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z , the strong friend of Carlos Vera , was in@@ sist@@ ed that she named him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she wanted to do this , but then after that . this should always be eu@@ ver for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos . but for two years she carried out the psych@@ ic violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ zable :
I would never thought that I would become victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
when I read earlier this I thought that only women &apos;s happened to be sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they dec@@ eive non @-@ violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic if he ever picked up the hand against them and refused to be a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had dropped so long from Carlos , and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner had har@@ assed her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women all in any way victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
in the group you can talk to others about their experience , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
her we@@ al@@ thy partner ultimately managed to convince her , to persu@@ ade them that they were worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as advertisements in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she developed a process against its former partner , which developed into an unbe@@ ar@@ able j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , primarily for money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the display of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems with the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament and became known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non @-@ Wen@@ ders ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law is to explain the Fem@@ ale d to a stand@@ alone criminal case as already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia is the case .
thus , the legis@@ l@@ ature has changed in some points to win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are generally banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had provided , most of the ( bureauc@@ ratic and economic ) proce@@ eding to bear the victims of violence at present , if they just wish to receive a secure vacation , to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the Law is not effective if the legis@@ lator has no sufficient financial resources for this :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ alism is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here , a re@@ mind is supposed to take place , that violence is no longer considered a bit of Normal .
those who lies in view of these facts , he testi@@ fied and bears witness to that the perpet@@ rators brought him .
we need to be so long as long as it is not considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Act was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , but among other things , a passage was cancelled because of the partners in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the Ag@@ gress@@ or , to attack his sacrifice .
the cancellation of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law applies however as a big set@@ back .
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the number # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , which reports on women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect people affected .
independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continues attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ ic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the Sult@@ ans .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he had a prison sentence .
two other editors from Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and submitted before court , but later returned .
Oman is governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had left his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , through a coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Defence , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank .
the dom@@ ination of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the har@@ dening efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic intelligence , including press freedom , and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , to be so@@ ber and imprisoned .
the authorities restric@@ ts peaceful and legi@@ timate operations in human rights systematically and beyond citizens , even activists , in order to express their views over the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the arrest of three of her editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( a total mon@@ archy ) since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , until they were prohibited by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties , &quot; which was published in the newspaper on July 26th , 2016 , after corruption in justice and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to withdraw a judgment in an inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , member of the Committee , was arrested by the ISS before the special department and was arrested in his arrival at the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who is acting as editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed on un@@ defined time after the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissemin@@ ation of the newspaper in all ways , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first hearing was held in Mas@@ k@@ at the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Tribunal sentenced three journalists to pris@@ ons and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted for disorder of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &apos; and &quot; under@@ mining of the State . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the infr@@ ing@@ ement of public procurement and de@@ fam@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and mon@@ pen@@ alties from 3,000 om@@ ans Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year occupation against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 U.S. dollars ) after having found the use of &quot; Information Security , &quot; which could represent a danger for public order . &quot;
a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was scheduled for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eal Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Ab@@ ri in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after b@@ iting his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he will serve his sentence .
the Appeals Chamber also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information on the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again rep@@ lied , the newspaper looks like before attacks by the om@@ ic government .
on 8 January the Minister of Information received a statement that the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister for Information received personally a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister sur@@ render an additional time against the decision of the Appeals Court .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman was injured in Oman in recent years .
for example , to further injuries , for example , the closure of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , an impression is not ready to prepare that the Ottoman authorities will not be ready to make an end to the freedom of press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the British authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promp@@ tly and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2. a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create their re@@ por@@ ters of their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances apply that human rights def@@ endants and journalists in Oman imp@@ eded their legi@@ timate human rights and without fear of prevention , including judicial c@@ ures .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization dedicated to human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf area and in neighbouring countries to assem@@ ble peac@@ efully , supported and protect them protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with understanding
medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that is addressing one of the most urg@@ ent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need in local medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of global healthcare sector many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and mal@@ aria in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa have far greater impact than elsewhere , and missing investment in the discovery of this disease by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
second@@ ly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , while establishing its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can be favourable for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for the Research of Infection Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , in the 1990s , just as the first independent impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , at first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he explored the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment I focuses on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
furthermore , I rigid an research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion according to the important recent scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only rely solutions to have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay recipi@@ ents instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists to find projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are being actively supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or draw here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you don &apos;t had previously ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interested , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age .
there are requirements for special scientific training , starting in each age .
social science , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from that .
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa towards western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the gain access to scientific expertise that represent challenges .
the system , that the articles are only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how to change &quot; open source &quot; seed manufacturers to change worldwide food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky appeared initially on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s .
his company offers 114 types , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant , which was cultivated by NASA @-@ Astr@@ onau@@ ts in space and is consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ al &apos;s work was only managed by its own car@@ pet@@ ty and the question how many sal@@ aries are able to obtain limits .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he could not continue using them .
the patents are not only for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resistance levels compared to diseases , a special Rot@@ or , or gre@@ ased leaves .
over the past few years , more such patents have been registered for more plants , such as cereals or cart@@ el varieties . due to this trends , plant bre@@ e@@ ders , environmental protective and expert for food safety , will ensure the future of food production .
as passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ long tradition , M@@ orton still far@@ med let@@ tu@@ ce , however , since his work still needs more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when a b@@ oul@@ ders river would lie in a river , around whom I have to shr@@ ink . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we have to do this , but it &apos;s a break with breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents have to go far too far .
and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new sal@@ ads , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he makes it so good as possible and tries to extract the features that he wants .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
it is also connected to a movement which is always bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and eaten red Roman sal@@ at in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station , where plants can be cultivated in space .
photo : NASA
it &apos;s no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather than that the movement origin@@ ate from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; Sa@@ at@@ gut ) is inspired by the Movement for Free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , providing alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was initiated in order to ensure that some plant types and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant bre@@ e@@ ders .
as part of the initiative , O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ e@@ ders may also under@@ take that others could use the plant @-@ free from them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with its seeds . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ e@@ ders allow others to cross their seed , to cross their own varieties , and it is not possible - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
experts from the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
Sa@@ at@@ gut is playing a role in major cont@@ ex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of pe@@ as@@ ants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ e@@ ders would try to use latter or only little to work with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who like good , locally and sustainable producing vegetables have to be purchased in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way is cultivated on farming markets , like this vegetable consumption is cultivated .
nutritional @-@ confident without seed so@@ vereign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to provide other things at the open source . thus , its occurrence is to be patented in contrast , seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i support will ar@@ gue that the future of food supplies are endanger@@ ed because the available group pool due to the increasingly promising intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always limited , un@@ break@@ able .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carr@@ ots and their availability . she found that approximately one @-@ third of all the anti@@ qu@@ eries are protected as intellectual property , which means it is not suitable for plant bre@@ e@@ ders either .
for other plants , there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass so@@ lic@@ ated plants like wheat are patented even more than sal@@ v@@ ets or carr@@ ots .
a Question of Vis@@ ible
plants are cultivated as well , that they are targeted - of such nutrients through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to those in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ e@@ ders are decre@@ asing by increasingly more patents . however , genetic diversity may currently be more constra@@ ined than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than ever since change in climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to is recognis@@ able that genetic diversity is generally important and important for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four Gene@@ alog@@ ics and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company set itself the conservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contra@@ dic@@ ts that intellectual property supports other bre@@ e@@ ders , since &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ets innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken away as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get into the same result with another method .
such protection does not inhib@@ its innovations , but fo@@ sters them to provide more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
M@@ orton looks the different : 20 years to wait until a patent is christ@@ ening , doesn &apos;t burn any innovations .
and if you &apos;re waiting for that long wait for plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the struggle .
the main argument for M@@ orton requires that genetic resources always have been a general good and still should remain unchanged : &quot; independent plant bre@@ e@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want to simplify farmers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible to use us if we don &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , M@@ orton bo@@ ther@@ ed himself to the concept to patented plant characteristics : &quot; we are creating the characteristics not really .
they form the plants themselves and as bre@@ e@@ ders , we have no idea how plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever creates a variety , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who comp@@ ile their own values in them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who believes in industrial agriculture with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for which cultivation areas of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , are breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
while several medium @-@ sized companies ( such as mon@@ san@@ to remain in international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they provide most smaller seed companies - either refuse to re@@ ject the cartridge or hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeding Frank M@@ orton looks for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ e@@ ders would result by the avoid@@ ance of plant pat@@ rons of innovative : &quot; it looks like being able to produce new products , stronger than companies that patented .
I need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years himself , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent is being protected for 20 years before competition , what makes it easy to make my opinion very nicely . &quot;
although the U.S. seem to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , however , the concept continues to spread rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , &quot; ) is described as a professional organization in the area of resources , a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed product . the centre with farmers work together and helps them to breeding new varieties to meet certain requirements .
it also supports it to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell its own .
the German organization Agre@@ ements is working on an &quot; open source , &quot; which ultimately represents a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i @-@ obligation for bre@@ e@@ ders in the European Union .
( regulations concerning breeding differ from country to country , for which the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks to the current practice of the European Patent Office , making patents applied to conventional plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is necessary to implement the Member States to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; Sa@@ at@@ ters and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend for pat@@ ching seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for &quot; Open Source &quot; Sa@@ at@@ ters , &quot; the organisation currently has a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; Sa@@ at@@ ters , for the scheduled next year of the official start .
a merger of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Concentr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds , technology and Concentr@@ ation , in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a Sa@@ at@@ gut Map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ential - a consortium of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - it represents that farmers have to cope with seeds which ensure a stable supply of food and food .
in the report also emphasi@@ zes the importance of a varied , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to recognize it soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods have especially been resp@@ ected , where and how a bit has been added , and sa@@ at@@ ters have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to declare it even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
even un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities in the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend at the 0@@ 5th August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the Network released a statement on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , bl@@ urred and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information permanently , despite this attack and the re@@ jection of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s never confirmed that it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI also confirmed that all technical possibilities would be exhau@@ sted to overcome the blocking , and not . we en@@ vi@@ ate to fulfill our task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blo@@ cked off the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaze@@ era network from Qatar , because of the alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights of human rights Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissemin@@ ation of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he does not access@@ or@@ ate websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he prepared to deal with the Egyptian government , was an attack by the Egyptian government .
blo@@ gger , which is native to the Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the student protests , and recorded a video like the police force of physical violence against two students .
his article is mainly turning politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada said to the lock by the government and reflecting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even though the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ ful for the world , however , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is managed to conv@@ ey me the feeling of an ag@@ gression ; an arrest , a search@@ able murder , pre@@ charge of the national Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs and any other website , for which I worked .
2 ) Do not have shown that I wrote for nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only a small audience only .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
at first , I used it to the post of articles to deal with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after they blo@@ cked him , and that they may fear him , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ zzle go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities un@@ locked Egyptian authorities on 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of suppliers , by changing internet c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began , began .
such practice suggests to int@@ end the government &apos;s intention to block content and to filter content that could access Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed that the government &apos;s decisions were hit behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , by which it can proceed against this action .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government prepared with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day for day trips newspapers in whole Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines made from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home country of many postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro murdered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ ve rau@@ ben pharmacy , military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the economic crisis in the middle of the economic crisis and in a split financial situation , the 2017 Ge@@ wal@@ tw@@ elle reached its highest stand for 10 years .
the Global Justice NGO &apos;s Brazilian NGO called even the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these are all everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16 , the Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper stated for their decision said :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in any major city on the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , is published by the civili@@ zed standard in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , that we won &apos;t close our eyes as a journalist before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure is :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 , states that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we deliber@@ ately aware that a war dis@@ course , if he is dist@@ orted , the atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots , and then asked questions to prohib@@ it .
but we defend the war on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose target is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they are used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil argu@@ ed the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , to refer the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion according to a jus@@ tification of the failed security policy through the media and could be troubled , Respon@@ sible in the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as with the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ adequate investments in personnel , En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ regarded neg@@ lig@@ ible of public service .
reminder : the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

at the beginning , this resulted in a decline of violent death cases . for a few years , U@@ PP was supposed to protect against poor communities and repression against poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux set out from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio draws severe consequences for human beings .
for this is ur@@ ges the state on , means , and ways to use the typical of a &quot; enemy . &quot; in which a civil war is a sharp point in the countryside , and the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; ir@@ oned balls . &quot;

since the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , located in Damascus and Hinter@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
especially strong is the region East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 , demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations , and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these reb@@ els have been carried out outside the territory of Damascus under si@@ ege , which led to local residents , or cre@@ ted by tun@@ nels and inspection points .
through the lon@@ el@@ age block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ reachable in large parts of the population .
a group of Syrian humanitarian assist@@ ants and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i are not among the traditional , planted in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . her food is however an attractive food for many people of the besie@@ ged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the Project , subscription Maikel Nabil , commented on the French news agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided for cultivation of fung@@ us , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant@@ ing in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , this project became known and pressed his relief that it now wins more and more &quot; acquain@@ t@@ ance . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , take advantage of the humanitarian c@@ row@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as .
it is planned to mediate 125 families of knowledge of fung@@ us , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is instruc@@ ted to generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and relative humidity of 80 % .
locally produced fuel from plastic are used locally , in order to supply generators with the necessary power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the regions desc@@ ended &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality , whether they are suited for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; lec@@ ture@@ ship for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have been distributed anywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pilgrims of different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spreading of a culture of self @-@ supply by eating food ( such as paper , tea , coff@@ e@@ atz , cardboard , etc ) for the opening of new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want that our experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired people in crisis areas and we can help mankind &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese Call Justice for the Vic@@ tims of Br@@ ings of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ esting on 21 October in many areas of shau@@ gh@@ ten in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that ro@@ de in the northern part of Portugal .
two @-@ two persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the Wald@@ fires between the 15th and 16th October . this resulted in that the government had proclaimed the last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ic@@ ia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire @-@ break@@ through@@ s that spread across the north and central regions of the country , reaching approximately 250 million hectares of forest and many villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitored the forest area by satellite , in 2017 alone , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest is burnt in Portugal - an area of the Lisbon area .
so you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the location : there is no fire only in 4 districts .

the sigh@@ ed tragedy
the objective of the Saturday &apos;s protest was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked , why the civil war was unable to in@@ dem@@ ise the extent of the tragedy so far as possible
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al declared the Bund of the State of Portugal stated by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did so now@@ here : there are dozens of open roads between open roads , which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would happen again as in June , because the streets were very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in positions of high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko are ques@@ tioned .
an extensive proposal on the wh@@ ip , which had brought the government following serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was requested by the municipalities that saw the new rules as obst@@ acle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a emp@@ t@@ ying of the law , if the applicant could be restricted by means of means of self @-@ protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão S@@ val was built in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ c@@ us made aware that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , spread like in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ie , according to Br@@ its of this sort .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal is on 15th and 16th October , when people sought or tried to contact those who had to learn offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : you used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time over the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was ex@@ acting on this f@@ ate@@ ful weekend in October that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users , which followed the fires , counted the site more than half a million requests .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan started by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in groups that defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of Gh@@ az@@ ni in Central Afghan , for the last time with his family together .
even though his mother had not said it then , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break .
his unc@@ le would pick it up and bring him to the locks .

CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , was just murdered by the Taliban and suddenly strug@@ gl@@ ed by the Taliban .
the Taliban were always closer to its hin@@ estones on the Haz@@ ara Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ her@@ b@@ bin . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took that of his small wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ar who were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his living .
at that time , the life of Afghan Refu@@ ge@@ es in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan Refu@@ ge@@ es ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site that we worked on .
there were no services there and no heating . we suspended the open window , so that we don &apos;t sei@@ ze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
at the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered a ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabit@@ ated Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , and left alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that spread twice a day of food .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for the past asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the Human Rights Organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; this is a impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission center if they officially put an application for asylum - what can be used after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , have either instruc@@ ted to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road .
so it came also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ com@@ ended li@@ fel@@ ong helped A@@ shar@@ af soon coming from these conditions .
after having made several years in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af earned his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel with a while after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Success Story is now theme of the documentation &quot; Disabled &quot; Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was announced for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureauc@@ racy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghanistan operated companies , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants even have been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and kitchen staff have mostly displac@@ ed refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu &apos;s menu tells the different Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and gre@@ ek dishes , the history of their trip to Italy .
Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome , also Afghanistan .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims nevertheless range far beyond the Italian cuisine and retail trade , and targets back to the country , which he had to aband@@ on the teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers in the country &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest provinces , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and must get the same possibilities like all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af offers plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where humans can learn packaging and preser@@ ving techniques . &quot; thus , they can improve their harv@@ ester on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertain@@ ty and dou@@ b@@ ts , but in the end there is stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey even . now he would also want to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

the Egyptian Parliament also exam@@ ines a draft law that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration by government authority .
users would have to use the social networks to use social networks , within six months after the successful legis@@ l@@ ature order , on the website of the authority , under specification of its complete name and registration number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to six months .
the law , which was advertis@@ ed by six@@ ty parliamentary members , is currently being deb@@ ated to the legislative and the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May there was a further dep@@ u@@ ties for a law@@ suit , in which har@@ der was introduced to the har@@ dening of the president or a high civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian Law , the Bel@@ ei@@ ment of the Pre@@ sidents and the state @-@ of @-@ state institutions would actually be pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law , however , such legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy would be prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the law should be adopted , this means that up to three years imprisonment for the convicted .
in addition , this would become a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and reconciliation have already been in danger since many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ mou@@ d subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sh@@ aw@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while violence against prot@@ esters demonstrated against the military coup that led against the military coup led to the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sh@@ aw@@ kan was wa@@ ited for more than 700 protests , who were arrested in the same incident four years in prison .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison leadership of the German human rights was post@@ pon@@ ed to bring the accused by the prison .
Sh@@ aw@@ kan is threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups were conven@@ ed , pseud@@ o @-@ ownership of such arms , illegal meeting , murder , and an attempt to kill slaugh@@ ter .
