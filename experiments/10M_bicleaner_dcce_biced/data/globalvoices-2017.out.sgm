<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have read American authors and operated his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me, that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14 years old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter, who coincided with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student who wanted to occupy his interest in the German Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it, whether that's the absolute Truth, forgot everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose variety is so inviting, that you are always that you are and it's easy acceptance in a community of equal human beings.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very little love letter concerning his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written over the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">For me, the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is towards me as he walks with his involvement.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as it is beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he did think like a former colleague, declares publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamus and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet people have responded to his statements and agreed in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number of the party nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that support this bigs person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not know Trump and his voters with the people who I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalism program, people from all over the world, a deeply troubled man, with whom I could talk about Islam and past.</seg>
<seg id="23">In this, Trumps did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to view the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity, which I lived with Sandy Bahr, who fights their lives in the environment, and her husband, Dave, my host family, who treated myself like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet it adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace to help us to amperate the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, have helped me with my mentors to help me in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those affected by them embodied my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">During his way to the nominal republican Presidential candidates, she baked me a halt and the counterpart of its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it presented itself, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps due to his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the confrontation with the idea that humans have voted for trump because they were either authorized by racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, and broke me almost the heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it's unfair to describe the Trump voters as a shaving.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people, said, "said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful, suggesting an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears are not considered to be considered in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that this voters, of which most knows, have approved for drunkards, because they would like to regain control over a country that she disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they would perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, which comments the cruel decision to raise a man, which look with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(up.).: as much as" "" "white against all other ethnic" "" ";" "" "white against all other ethics" "" ";" "" "white" "" "(like enlightentrauma), as much as the big Van Jones" "", "has exactly the killed what America was so magnificent." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background can always be always, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose the son of an Kenyaners, whose history as he himself says, anywhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of white America's promises to promise and says: towards Hell with regard to freedom, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all of whom I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he said at the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally in Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" broker the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out and their voices were pure.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would someone like you, isn't such a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son, sent to him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find no more space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="70">That the music, played at both locations, is not only changing the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music - living with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill colony, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby preheated ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years, the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra, which with their musical instruments, has an opportunity to overcome them surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for its drugs abuse and the bonds force.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project, and the youth always offered a rare hopelist.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch, they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura is playing around the biggest landfills of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguayan capital - on instruments which are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments that consist of local fixed waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling of Favio ChÃ¡vez has begun to transform parts of the drop into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitates violin, viola, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trombones, trombones, trombones, trombones, trombones and percussion.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez recalls Ravio ChÃ¡vez, a local teacher and musician instructor of the children of Cateah, at the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no room to rehearsals and we had to accept the children in the trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he never had previously seen: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra that plays on instruments made of re-prepared material and is named The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that specifically regarding international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release takes place within the framework of a agreement with Global Voices for shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, this ship was already known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing fishing before the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore increased accordingly and little geneiving, a law criminals welcome this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique and Seychelles mobilised themselves quickly against the ship. they refused to lay a fisherman to their harbours and refused to come to him a fishing stand.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that just refuse" "", "Benedict Kiilu, an executive employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority," "" "he is part of a team that discovered the ship and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it wasn't able to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia because of pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">Apart from Somalia and Madagascar the members of this network are the six countries who had cast out the Prime Minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equal and work together. they exchange information and stand each other when it goes to illegal fishing" "", "Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is being caught, because it is extremely difficult to increase, so the illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing by regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By intentional respect of existing laws, certain living rooms and species is supposed to harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing once were obstructed through bureaucratic hurdles, with the information between individual countries, these acts today happen in real time, with traceable to FISH's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange, including lists of existing licences, news about suspicious activities or details, which you had taken or experienced during a port spection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i trades the activities of ships, too very attentive, when moving on the open lake, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to characterize ships that fish in banned areas - such as those that point to point that a ship invites its caught fish to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideals, such studies show whether the involved ships have a fish license, where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a penfreer.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing devices can then refuse on the basis of such ships in their ports. what means that ships cannot sell their load. and they even could be forced to be punishable as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it will be substantial financial losses for the owners, meaning that the illegal catch catch is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform has been created to recover lost 20 million USD in lost sales, the eight members of the network HISH-i lost every year because of illegal fishermen that penetrate into Eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has undertaking one of the most productive tuna fishing fishing trails, attracting commercial fishing from all over the world, among these also storially those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other things, actions include the sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, indication of phasienamen, fish protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "use the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-organized control system," "" "Long." "" "earlier, a ship managed to fish illegally and a country could say 'You will not run my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legale hole is trying to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">FISH has been involved in more than 30 investigations since its inception.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks uncovers the falsibly licences in Tanzania. discovered ships that have several deceitful identities and found it pursuing flying ships and found them.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authorities on combating crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing via large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's SatellitSystem, which is always developed further, helps to quit illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "we are attempting to cross-crossed," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also offers technical support and FISH technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships can switch their automatic identification systems, where they cannot be stacked by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can really take influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and can be rendered to each of each individual traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "to get in order to get a better picture of it, who's what does - this makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance to unite and develop their resources to investigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on a global level. "Pew Charitable Trusts have a similar project to run on the global system tracking of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but they also screams.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had previously fished without license and hardly need to calculate with consequences, know that they can be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participated in FISH countries by a 33% increase in fisheries sales, more licences for more licenses ever since fishing boats.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 had helped the inspectors there, found the inspectors there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these achievements." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu." "" "we have become a research project." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined together, for the so-called West Africa Task Force. they now fight against illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "" "" with safety, even more such initiatives and structures also occur in other regions "" "" says Copeland. "" "</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest membership in Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship which was on the way under false flag, and not only the ship used without a license and have been banned towing nets.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still included in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" take a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing "" "," says Bergh. "" "</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH, this is another success of many. and at the same time, the evidence is that such special, collaborative work is actually working throughout the cosmos.

<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you do not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">Back then I could not recognize that my father was a thief, foils and robbers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis I had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerieve. during the Argentinean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983, a period of State of State, his father was Deputy Commander of Intelligence in La Perla in 1976-1978.</seg>

<seg id="275">I always asked myself, how my father, the leader of security forces, could join this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the Gendarmerie and I would never have to invade into a house and to steal everything therein.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminals, and I answered: and you who were on the road on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no detective?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded anger, struck me, and cried:</seg>

<seg id="301">I guess it was just decided to kill these people. but why would they disappear their bodies?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did people not have families, to whom they could commit their mortal remnants?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abhorrible act, which can do a man.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation defects are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For transferring, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and transmit active language skills to transfer him to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is in the case of motherlanguage. generally speaking, translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French mother tongue was translating from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the native language, the translations into English. this may be missing an understanding of translation, reasons, or the relatively small number of English-language artists who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees have no foreign employees. then, the Japanese employees, whose English knowledge is considered the best, for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machined translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The tolerated and encapsulated propositions which can emerge by machined translations, that this technique may not replace any human translators. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the most strange English formulations in Japan, including T-shirts or bags, are used only for silent reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation errors may be unacceptable or at least harmless. but from large enterprises or by the government to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translation.</seg>

<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, then this means that they are applying for a strong surveillance system to filter citizens, or not. and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and to carry out a court case.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, which had been achieved for the northeastern Japan, achieved the progress made by the "triple-catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima happened.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its seat in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. the Prefecture of Miyagi was a public prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbourhood contours of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had vanished all the coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima prefecture experienced an atomic accident, so far, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows two years from local viewpoint which have been achieved to rebuild the life of local-resident companies.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results.</seg>
<seg id="550">The construction of housing in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that until December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (gobstructed, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Fukushima prefectures, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi scored the biggest success under the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima, with 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the catastrophe, they still endeavoured to settle for six years after the catastrophe, managed by Behelfsacu (get caught, kasetsu juutaku).</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple-catastrophe nearly 80 000 people saw to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of Fukushima still living in emergency accommodations in 2011. more than 75 per cent of the evacuation centres were successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuations were sheltered after the disaster in Behelfsacsten, were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper could determine 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by the misfortune, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi have again been put into operation in Fukushima, only 30 percent of fishing ports have retaken their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have moved large in co-face.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of agriculture in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic fact is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed arquitoes of Fukushima, "the nuclear strike of Fukushima,"</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism has largely recovered, but also here Fukushima remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the misfortune. Fukushima, however, only 75 percent can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys under the local population and evacuated by the evacuation. they asked them about the state of rebuilding and also, as their empathy changed towards the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted an interview to bring about the tsunami awareness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents were taken in action to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents knew that still not enough in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who could evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has reinforced their attention to the position of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only experience the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic accident, atomic accidents, Japan ever had to participate.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved out in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in durable spare houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster-catastrophes, most of the evacuation centres are older than 50 years old. they have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima, with massive construction projects. this is a project projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Unundustralization of Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">The introduction of the Act of Ãlvaro Reynoso included almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba for the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The People's Community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as a Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were added to the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After developing the sugar cane industry, the sugar cane industry was quiet, and the factory lost in and after its annexes, until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be reinvent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some variety the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others signed and commend daily to factories that are grinding yet.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a veteran veteran that is open every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn't seize his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He listened to work in the east of the region of sugar cane factories, which are again in operation, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something, what he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds one of them that in MaÃ±alich would have received the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resists the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country some decades, but the poor harvests are already no realism.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church looked better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity: 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly ever more competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to concentrate on the production of the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only allowed the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs, which led to such measures, were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the breeding crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased again approximately one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "" "" "from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the UN," "" "Agricultural Prospects" "" "from the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar imports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "the present day will go down with security in history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as a soldier, talking about the closure of the factory, the word which he is repeated, "Scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first running year, the first letters started.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents that only differ from the parts, which are removed, the addressee and the date distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility was revised and the letters were always more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory, and he was one who received the letters. "the land had no money assured for the use of the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waiting for the retirement in another system, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will, at the termination of the factory, which helped the construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part, he removed, he removed one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most advanced industrial sector developed by Cuba and the most important workplace producers was deleted.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for the workplaces and services that were generated in the municipalities were created in which they were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the then president in the eyes of the present people saw as he guaranteed that the factories had no longer run in operation for five years.</seg>
<seg id="671">The price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories</seg>
<seg id="672">Since 2004, sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory ended, or better, when they started, they stopped, they listened to asphalt, these disadvantaged other establishments.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>

<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production does not serve for the supply of the community.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they are doing with Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop manager mobile electronic studios direct to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were headed by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in northern Quebec, with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus raises that the young participants in talks issues such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self acceptance" or what they always come into the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of TrÃ¤nen," a road section in Westcanada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases have mostly not been clarified.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate, as important the obtaining of traditional customs and customs despite the globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song we recorded Whapmagoostui Cree First nation, the refrain is sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved a little help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars Hip-Hop Group, who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan the strophe is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like, nobody ever would like to be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way to live in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how to live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">Thus they can grow and advance to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So you can do that, why it has determined the creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic courts in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, what is exactly on the menu, will be exhibited in the proximity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (deed, "" "" plastic models of meals ") provided by any food, which is served in this restaurant." ""</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see this plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue to enter the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry that devotes itself to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district of Kappabashi, there is a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes made by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually found that they don't even need them any more. however, a new trend turns them today in showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic dishes made mobile tapes as they will be shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kitten harvesting objects, such as in this case, cooling control magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shootings cabinet magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in dining tables is becoming increasingly complicated.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaolin-don (a popular travel shell with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use for the triangular bowl (lol).</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also made this part to the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is a apple who peeled your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to view as a apple, with a notch for the mobile, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the coming.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and cell designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some user had their doubt:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anyone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetite form to surprise your colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile support has the shape of melodiac ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, we are also traveling balls (onigiri), earrings and palm bands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further skurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the Hashtag #, ',', ','.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trends, this video gives you an insight in the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. as for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media over the notorious "struggle against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missts and cereals regularly appear in statistics. however, these reflected not the extent of human tragedy, which brings together to this battle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the boss of the Sinaloa box, pushed the stories of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, someone looks for the grief or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind each corks, behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds will never be healing.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trafficking"), this victims is to give a voice and telling stories of people who culminated in the struggle between the penal persecutions authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime shall not only be afraid to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers, and all communities have to travel so many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>

<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fears life") tells you exactly these stories.</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader from Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never consider as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensation journalism now for several years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'm coming every day of newspaper ckiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which actually come from a textbook for criminology or from files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel the feeling, as if I am the only one or sad. it works, like a lack of respect for the person who once became one of these bodies.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be equal, or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin think that he's big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "Labours" of the perpetrators when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, when they have lost ones who lost someone, and those who have fear, even so something happened.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories will become blooming in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village thus justifies that they were" "" "resident" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they're trying to speak, that they should be spared from such tragedies if they are not stir and quietly.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four Montelling in the Capital District:" it describes a family with threats from their business until they did not only destroy the business until the end of the month, it was not only destroyed by the business, but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you've lost and remember how many people can change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain on it never goes, the trauma remains high, the fear is high, if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">We are further away from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested others, because they don't know when they will lead or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I didn't ask myself in these frightful days, but the reply is no, but the reply is no, because I've forgotten, how to cry out, I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the Contribution "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence signed by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">He raises questions on how: who cares about the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he relates that he had to teach himself like an egg, potatoes broth, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vipers with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left Bone - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and learning to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that ended his childhood.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody bear was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez was born this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city of the world based on the number of murder according to the Council of public security and the Government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecution was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of always new headlines. this project reminiscent of those who cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal PolÃ­tico was launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, its goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which the country has tortured in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to lift up a rumor or counterfeit a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the year after something dipped the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it was used irreversibly used to have tragedies, which actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false pairing of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not denying the fact that there are plentiful reporting about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures at news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank-wagons crossing the village Sange on the east of the DRC, tipped around and exploded. 230 people came into life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa had become neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths of strokes, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank fell victim to the tank.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a movie theaters in the vicinity, which was full of people who knew the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses concealed and tasted corpses in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12 2015.Several photos of the incident form the grey scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of hollow body, which on the ground are inflated during persons.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story cannot find her end.</seg>
<seg id="835">More than the years ago the same photo was endued several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but not true for the related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the coastal towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">They reported drastically reported by atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and stores were burnt down and glued in roads and bones.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained to include corpses," "" "said an habitant to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were destroyed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-time can be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the armies in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and trying to win the Boko Haram in the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture of the DR Congo appears again, as evidence was falsibly presented to the fact and the possible extent of attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this missilly use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of dysfunctions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image has been applied as a cover for mass import.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments like this example from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange has also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash statement, published by the United Nations, those who could flee punches, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, Posts reported like the following that these descriptions were gathered with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a Saudi-Arabian news page, which was falsibly claimed by President Myanmars Thein. in addition, monks and politicians would have been involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page summarised that the President of Myanmar Thein had been involved in 2012 that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from Sange.</seg>

<seg id="918">The image has been witnessed as proof for the Boko Haram massacre (and more than 9.300 times). but the messages that were associated with no religious context were taken out in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (irradiation) that passes these posts. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the testimonials of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the affordings of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how an African life has been assessed compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it's worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens if readers can't give these images longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are seventy people affected by the unintended share, the water is around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and narrowed it the real horror of what actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The proliferation of violent images has already been debated in detail (e.g., for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the retention of pictures of a refusal is equivalent to the tragedy. sometimes these images are even endued by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that nonviolent screenshots and spectators will take their ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, who sought how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are a lot of discussing nonviolent representations in the news media, fact that it is indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms in order to support the fight against "Fake News". they are thoroughly thinking about situation in which a picture is suggested, but what actually can be solved from the context or completely misused species.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e.g. unnecessary) endeavored to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (e.g. the Spanish swirl).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resists stubnly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not sufficient, why complete explanation and sometimes a bit context are required to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have already been collected for a full time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, one finds the words of Vanuatu's Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - BemÃ¼h for your parents in recognition of what you aspire to yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrrik Language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or sloth, which you feel after being heated in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They remove other cultures, cover other memory and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, as we do the world around us, analyse and classify the linguists on this page still want to publish more these "irreplacable" words, and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone to enter in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is a possible response to stories in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported about another initiative of Steven Bird, the Unmanageable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are held in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite small languages will not be distributed to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The project is valid for the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we need cities to assume diversity, safe rooms, in which inhabitants must not forget to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often, to understand," "" "these events take place instead," "" "to appreciate the listening to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers ask their story in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the Participants are not a professional storytellers, their dedication and their presentation do so that the audiences can be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou convenes also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak of the Rabbit and the pavian in the language of Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having explained the meaning of its Fable, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is that to speak to an audience, which does not understand her language?" with a broad grasp he shares his feeling of included:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of the Treasure Language storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand that from the project, you can contact TLS in contact to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian WEBENTWICKLER Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been operating since over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, supporting his supporters and relatives of the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions that he made for an open network.</seg>

<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, published excerpts from the book's Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective descendants).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and licensed, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how to create movements for Free knowledge and what the true costs are associated with which this is associated.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in movements for Free knowledge have side to look around the nebula who gives our newsfeeds and create something sense from our various experience.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the Adra prison directory, which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that wants to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, has many of us begin to think about their own destinies, miracles and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose us?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporary beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The WEBENTWICKLER for Open Source and digital activist has been in detention of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location.</seg>

<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in the Internet and to know access to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologian and currently surpassed the leader of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes were predictive as the work which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, around the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the way of numerous civilizations and are merging Greek-Roman architecture types with hiding traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after having started working with this work, the IS would present all of that architecture, which embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike in the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule created for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not unlock this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life to dream, from freedom to dream and Bassel, taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English at, even when he was already imprisoned in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with each other, who asked. he taught other incarnated English to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other detention, like it is using computers, at least theoretically without knowing it in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a test book which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the International Human Rights Organisation of Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison since 2011.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: a post-corruption director for corruption resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted to a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his prison sentence on which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants because of indestructed resulting from 54 million Metikal (approximately 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, the council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his resetting into the company, which happened on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which claims the application, there would be no obstacle course for Cambaza, to resume his old post, because the company had no disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution responsible for public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the company's decision to establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Provides a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and even a backstep in regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we're aware that the company would have to discipline a disciplinary procedure against the infringement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent, however, and prompted no appropriate legal steps for applying the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior, and considers the case as "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent owner, he would be a consultant, after having been sentenced to prison, half of which has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could maintain lectures and motivating talking, he could advise and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has decided to reintegrate it into the company that helped save damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resist!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and a student of political science in Brazil, says the director no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded from the state because he didn't believe it, that someone recompensed for such a way that the state has grown massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals and serve to serve as a state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only managed the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was used the state, as handele became an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become weary, the recharged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºt preferred it to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison quarters of Samora and will not only remain as the first independent president in Remembrance, but also as sharp, trimming and - side by saying - Prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous illustrations was, when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious human being, too, is the fatherland for its ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if a ambitious human being changes, my experience shows that which is not so. he changes the tactics, but he doesn't turn from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being criminally. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were discontinued:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, he sat down 10 years and was free.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net, because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although more about the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "(in Burmese Scripture) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements gave the word to an extremely abusive connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the efforts to fight hate language in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The 'Kalar' may usually be associated with racism, but the word does not call automatically hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, or doubts for the use of his use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese, also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as well as other words as' Kalar pae '(spage),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends on spiritual nature, if they knew how he could use his back pain by doing a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the word face (la) to Burmese - resembles a racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Heuer is the opinion that she will reduce the hate language of radical nationalists, but also stressing that Facebook analytic must be analytical before spreading out all of the posts, to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook is deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on factorook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, analyse the mail carefully and check it by using the coming words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spage).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this dirty nationalists, the hate language, will receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is able to send a strong signal to everybody, the hate language, the efficiency of this strategy will not be long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords often become a catch- and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative write of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described like Facebook started out how Facebook wanted to delete his friends when he would only tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that blocked the word.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and it was forbidden to me, post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post has not been disastrous to the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from humans which have no negative intentions or simply try their views against hate talking radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are poorly bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have been done before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a beneficial intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">One such words can only be dispatched by more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they started without local context or technical support, such as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "Insencurry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they didn't tried mistakes, they did not tried to report falsely deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, they would have a big turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of lots of spott amongst users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users can now feel funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate pronunciation to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook-Posts who played no hate language, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission is used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmessian text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch the inheritance and a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try whether Facebook is the post, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post said, "If you're a doctor, do you heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate violence in social networks, violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in addition, especially in Rakhine area, where dispersions between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized on his burial sites on his burial sites, Facebook, for his failure.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of using the word 'Kalar', it would have better to look for context than on the context of concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Before this amendment to the Ehegesetzes, some members of Hinduist and Muslim religious denominations were gathered in practice. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group representing the representatives of various religious groups of the country, that the state was not intermingled because the state does not include the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened imminated the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Rights Convention, which is mined for children under 18 years of age. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15, Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 percent there were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the German Central Office of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were competing to abolish the laws followed for children's sake, followed on the foot and rejoiced great support. undoubtedly, they give up this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, e. g. had no concerns to say the critics of the children's sake, they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition catered for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and sometime doubt, if the opposition would not agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill was decided at the beginning of 2017 - despite 4 Senators (including one woman) of the Opposition and an independent who abstained, so that he could be discussed at the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would take him to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must agree to the law and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's broadcasters played a status-update on Facebook which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against children before the children's House was approved by 35 votes in the House of Representation.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After being decided in the Senate, the draft now can be applied to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media user was thrilled, because the laws have finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who fought a ministerial office at the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary cede, which has shifted the kernel of the thing, but know what? the children's matter is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now and this is worth every prize.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson's opinion, it was definitely enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Quo update on Facebook by Lara Quentre - Thomas, which says:, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Ehegesetz was decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for this - 0 it is!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Fold Mutota, belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society that says quite openly about it, how important is the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years independent of religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the change of marriage was approved today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives, 35 of which were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All the deputies, which were against the law, have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Children above is legally allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # Cancerage childcare.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj therefore, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Several months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to streamline judicial steps, should be the law, and he seems to be dissolving his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General Al-wi, a advocate of law, said it was absolutely legitimed when Maharaj wants to walk towards the law, most social media users, wanted to make the debate differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell struck about:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, when we say, instead of talking about the discussion, in a way that we would like to talk the state in our bedroom, simply that it may be of big, hard-represented men who are abused against them, "would you be ready to carry on the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law, or not, these legislation is an important step - however, there are still places around the world, in which children are legal or still the standard, although there is laws which they say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, opposite to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Act in the United States, internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over one month, Turkey has opened the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopaedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for Day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and share useful information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV-series are against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques used are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date articles from New York Times, Turkey has not reported the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been unlocked article from Wikipedia as recently as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been finalised since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world, when it is about the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and is often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the Interplan File System), as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e., computer-Calculator), which does not affect the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is also available in spite of the prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS report about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the messages (on Wikipedia) we have everything to set snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility of reading the content to decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view all Wikipedia content, even if you can't reach the website www.wiktionary.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also provided that this step was developed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of this website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to rewalk the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni, from Wikimedia, Italy has released both tr.vikiansikop.org, an open-source project that everyone can use similar Mirrorsides to hoists if in the respective country is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and staff at the Panigrahi's Open Bible "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It's no complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One is accessing another URL, which is not the original, that what you see, is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server guides the request to the right Wikipedia-page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia himself, if these are blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he looked around, never satisfied. they were missing with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him a camera to carry and try to grave the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar endeavoured to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international scene.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home location right next to Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guides attention to Neptun wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as it helps him a first-class situation at his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it give better for a passionate game photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested just at home, when I suddenly called Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my Father, that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was found, and I immediately began to get pictures of knee!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to close cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepalas Nature and would like to deepen the understanding of it that wild animals are not so furious, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he arose from face to face, saying,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb yourself from the opinion of the sheep on sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also because of darkness upon the way home, when suddenly the king's king appeared, and immediately, we look forward to seeing me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for Environmental Protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">Its passion for the promotion of Neptas Nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived mostly in a tent in order to take pictures of Otter. up to 12 days took it until he had a tiger photograph and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, who live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayseraaz Kalyanwala and originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of a Content-Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, use a ponomic or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">By Chhattisgarh until Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respecting the husband, as well as fear of consequences, they should ignore the norm on life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian State of Odisha by a pseudo-court and stubby her family and the village community after they had addressed a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">"" "" "" "the tradition of their wives also do not call upon name, is also distributed among men. however, they have far away less assignments to fear, if at all, they should not occur." ""</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff, and housewives, a unique club and became the main focus of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they discuss and discuss the enemies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and will be used for the mining of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to prohibiting HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages this clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and made them simultaneously with ambassadors of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, which showed Rohini in her discussion round, was unable to call their husbands on behalf of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has opted for this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands don't speak loudly, is an breeworthy to keep them guilty and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition attests that a woman must respect their husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't resist it is considered posterior, as woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have made us up to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who also called her husband, had never been called by name, try to try at home, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband weigh still long after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me, and said, I call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed it was a good cause because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected against all girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they may call us as they want, that they must not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husbands on her lips" "" "says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharastra over the breaking of a century-old tradition, in which married women may never promise the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so shy that during the whole practice it was cashed in front of herself; a second decided to settle the whole armoured frustration against him and his family by sending him cursed.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatically.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think, I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In addition, in Adrenalinrausch, with an ancient Brauch, the women decided that they would actually try to call home their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"" "the husband of a woman called" "" "Rohini" "" "and asked what ideas put them into the head: his wife could not stop his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she waited, she got afraid, saying that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the tractable of the interest noberred point on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the carcinating red point when he also took it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I heard it to carry him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"" "" "" "the other women have not heard completely, but my own, they are in a better position to choose it on some days." ""</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make women looking for, who could hear what, "says,"</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays in their lives with cakes; they danced and talked about things that they had never done before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working for so many years in these problems and yet I have made some things, for example, how our identities are linked to our husbands, never said so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great that certain things can say loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have maintained ourselves about the concept of honour and connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted a salmon-cta, a great shirt over a trousers, they don't have a herb.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of disputes and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes-selection, morals associated with the Saris and much more, shot Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed somewhat, Rohini confirmed that things come slowly into the roll:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we made only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they listened to tell the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it still, but only if they are alone, and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say still to the names of their husbands; only one or two women carry out Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach them in their lives - like thread for greater freedom of movement or own clothes - at the end of a hard to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving themselves each other self-confidence, it will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and others talking about what we're talking and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably recently made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published in the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo had gained attention in international community, after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (State endangered) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that the democratic reforms in China had been involved.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as "an internal matter" and a speaker tells it as "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nonetheless, China will continue to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel prize laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, friends or a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of Paares in Beijing, other topics are completely destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Hands Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met in late June, Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Liu Abroad for treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came in stores after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was given to Liu, although the Norwegian government had agreed that this was nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year. in June Norway signed a agreement to record the salmon trip to China, since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message had spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought up his hope to an unconditional release of expression and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his arrest he was not able to meet his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was prompted to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as they divided into a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We also expect that China raises all limitations of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1651">USA and USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad told us that Americans would like to have the possibility of treatment abroad, insofar as it was inviting him to help him. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the message agency AFP on 27 June that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities were not only Liu freizulously, but also his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>

<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to medical care of its choice, which they have to claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push out Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the Reuters news agency, that China had big concerns whether the vertebrae could surpass the libel by Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum, asked China to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to abandon his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer, AFP told that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room at the hospital, and that it is not permitted to speak with somebody outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China, its international human rights obligations, including the freedom of expression, true and the responsibility for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry called China in a statement on June 29, to Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken in order to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments, independent of where needed. furthermore, his wife and his family can contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news portal France has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, announced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide no further information if France will finally receive him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of the stronghold in Taiwan, called China on June 27, to" "" "Liu Freizulence" "" "and a bigger tolerance towards those who require peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu urged from the ruling Democratic Party's ruling party to allow the sick of intellectual liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed herself very worried about Liu and asked him that many have asked him to pray for Lius wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"" "" "" "it is my faith that he had taken, and had kept strictly punished, to a harmonic, more stable and prosperous China" "", "which would have contributed to a peaceful world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moving and also encouraged, when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed for democracy, freedom and statehood in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem to appear since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to Justice Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of an annual meeting of the State Chamber of the State of New York, the Minister said that many people criticised the domination of the only political party of Singapore, as compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered as a town.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody is asked to ask whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, where most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice, "The logic to rotate," to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrificed to create this valuable country, we hear that we had no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It is so vulgar, it had the licence of escape before the responsibilities, an obligation injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shanbragam were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of its, he appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, alike cities which are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the theme, again the good old lyre of the authoritarian power of power, giving to the present Democrats leave the verrotated logic because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week of Shanbragam, the last week of Shanbragam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judiative, our Political System really Non-Answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions will be covered with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng demands Shanbragam on his opinion, because they didn't understand these conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is to what land belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful when our werter K Shanmugam would take on the effort to solve this point, if he was paid up, in order to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing on the blog, he published his comment on the Critics that you should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference, in order to better understand the context of Shanbragam's statements, according to that Singapore was a town and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he said why the elections were so indispensable in Singapore, even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He was in Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore was no land, "he obviously did not generalise it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, which makes as leader of a global generation, such as polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what is said by the Minister of Justice of Singapore,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that expects me to agree with them or not, but that's another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure that he actually believeth right and conscious of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review crates the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr Shanbragam "has committed a mistake or was it a Freudger spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we are considered as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back to the sousovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it's equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role in the government cabinet, the testimony of Mr Shanmugam's principal meaning of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why is Singaporean their military service, defend it only their city, but not their land?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay our Prime Minister Invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">In the magazine Journey of a Decade, the magazine Journey of a Decade, is always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I have not said what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have expanded many Singaporean...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defense of the country especially" "", "but that's not quite correct." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak more about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1745">In my clarification, the standard response follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadian cook perhaps indifferent before anger, if they are kept for Americans, but don't disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadian put up a Canadian flag right at their backpack if they are travelling.</seg>

<seg id="1781">The new song "dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not politically, the music video relates to the ongoing military rule of the Junta.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin-Video "Der Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists complaining the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">You can interpret the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, such as it deletes with the state of the country under the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at the videos of the video, which refers to some of the political topics that Thailand have been prosecuted in Thailand over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may possibly refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which gives the Commander-in-chief of the host-chief decision-making of important national issues.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, he is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It's a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink Brillenframe and golden-coloured earrings in a teddy form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and has grown there. nevertheless, they know many of the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) became a target for Africans and Haitians, who are in transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2,50 Dollar night, the guests sleep in simple rooms, with grinding, crumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of african and Hawaiian migrants coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez told the people in full minibuses and the upper part of the coast they start to call: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mom from Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet but in this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have slept well outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to refuse to anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buys them medicines that they can't pay them, they massaged them with a balm coming from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him, if the Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghatache) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the heart of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston to meet her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans, which are on the way into the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other directions from Mama Africa. "mom Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He told that Haitian's and Africans often travels the way and that Africans speak on WhatsApp by Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his way, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as construction workers for construction sites of the Olympic Games and football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy has been weaker, he has started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. RamÃ­rez's future in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mother Africa is our mother and we never let them go," "" "he answered smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez told that her guests are often sending text messages when they continued to grate them, or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much more about Africa, but their guests have taught them to prepare chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps well-known, but it is not the only radio hope to travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a cul de sac leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter was Valenzuela and his family immigrant in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman and has noted that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are here, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least have they electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests make.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he tells you." "" "I have experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border through the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived there for three years, he was referred to a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before men who wanted to press money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for accommodation, and an Unknown, a Allrounder, has offered her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travellers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs RamÃ­rez seem happy about that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of them that went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she looks in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair braid who have made a demonstration, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, young and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter-user-managed to bleach</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10th, the mobile users in Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi a mobile phone alert when they chose the District government to install a surveillance App named Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In this communication, the app "will hints that" "" "to obtain access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they were shortly after they had installed the app, messages using a private WeChat group.</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs Website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to spend user attention, how much time they spend their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers could manipulate the home network of a person or to steal it from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages over digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the East and South, the reality is very often bleak for those who live in remote, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme endings and surveillance measures, as well as routine sectioning.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the Media-based Media Outlet" "" "Images from Mainland China" "" "(" "" "bleach" "" "), the censored news in China, displayed photos by a Checkpoint to check the residents either by a checkpoint that they had installed the monitoring app." ""</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people are using the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to be forced to use devices for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of the captivity through the rest watch technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" ("" "" bleach "" "") also published a Jingwang product description from which the software is able to raise the password needs of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are available in Xinjiang on electronic handrails.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in jingwang may possibly minimize a reaction to the instructions of the city party, to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report of Freedom House, a US-American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published an Regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with all residents and entrepreneurs, up to 1 August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos," however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible associations, including those that relate to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2069">Give him a pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you can't hold your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough yet, so that they can interchange the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first capture, I asked if the investigator had been working as a garbage collector, or if it belonged to normal working facilities.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables intertwined to present ourselves from their viewpoint, great invention of a gigantic cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour are three of them seldom, while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any sense in my body - and my voice, why I ceased to cry.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker rejects the cooling, and found no pleasure in it, so he's next to an electrically loaded staff handle.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through the whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body, which was stretched out on the ground, was the perfect power conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The doves disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours, he decided that he had already fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must probably have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to lay me back again; let's say, that's my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed, who came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens up and the morning light fulfills the room. "Rout with you, asshficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "I am answering with the voice of an exhaustive youngsters:" "" "my lord, my father must be worried." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"" "" "" "be quiet and walk away, you will move." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always set me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoke a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib divides the most of his time inside: he turns his screen to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What to leave, however, is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the topmost of his family house which belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel had completed his occupation of the Westbank, and Hdaibs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where she lived as a felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For more than six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist involved in the conservative majority and their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often involved with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian certainties, he calls on the core of the whole Arab world. all of these topics do not only find in his hometown, Amman Relevance, but also in cities committed to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits, and he can feel the devastating results of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it does not open it, it does not get a special ascent against the US-American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe his compassion for those who try to do in war areas, anything with his identity as "Palestinian pores of the second generation," he himself also called himself, even if he was born in Jordan, and never before Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own habitats," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I shook a man," while he dissolved in water in two cups, it is the holy month Ramadan; in that time it is intended for Muslims from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib apparently has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; otherwise a cup of coffee has to do little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the hose speak warm coffee and the swelling of the Kent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan is like a prison under the free sky, especially when taking a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it's easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan's water, to be not able to soden in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior of Jordan has cancelled its appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary debates which support the Muslim Brotherhood - the Muslim branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - arguing that sexual orientation of the country's homosexual frontsarers Hamed Sinno, contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the member of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that had been said to be cancelled due to sexual orientation of the death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the band's commitment in matters of affairs, such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and free opinion in the Arab world, be dangerous activism, which constitutes the old legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian nation as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continue to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may be not just a just-sided rhetoric, but actually a clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan contrasted that in Hdaibs work clearly appears.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib lost traditional gender norms that formed his vision from the fate of Arab women, the vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The painting shows the skeleton of a obviously unfamiliar woman, their arms, legs and legs can be loaded up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan, the number of 'Honorary de' increased the unofficial outside in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016. however, the number of honorary infrastructure is missing, however, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the undbreaking control of 1954, women who are accused of violence in jail, "and for their release is often required for a year-long bureaucratic expenditures, as well as the guarantee by the family, that the woman will nothing happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to revert many themes that are gassed in his country long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, that he doesn't agree his music, the full of explicit attack on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">To me politics was diminished, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question after the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeat itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get in his words, "that's what you want" - be it faith or failure, Heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians, saying that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals still have been censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya to remember that his comments were torn in the context and censored his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuvo, a poet of the eighth century, still remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuvo was supposed to work on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century, in the eighth century, Jordanians could not be able to write it?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new that government attacks against free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service adopted several former government officials and members of the teachers, having responded to the problems in social media, they had criticised corruption in their deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what's the concert Hdaibs, only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to have a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For the second time in a row, Mashrou'Leila will now make a performance for him, but the way of progress - this is how it looks slow, deliberate and internal changes. it is sure that this change from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society will take place.</seg>
<seg id="2144">There were Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without interventions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream to bring his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also among them, "they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region, together with music, art and literature is a real and fundamental openness, and not by bombs, spreading unitions and on artificial nature. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to shed and consequently make resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">This great, extravagant warribs are as fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories as regards the origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One presumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus. another theory has been delivered and out of a time, in the army marched by the West Japan in the northeast, around the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knee.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to snap a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (littl.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have long been looking for my long time again the Meguro Gajoen: two fortresses are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people, who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and another way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and looked at the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18 meter high feast was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were so important as in this story, because they help to promote Peruvian youth from Crime and promote a legitimate profession as the hairdressing.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near Lima's historic center - a region with a very high crime rate, where street smoke and illegal drugs day are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services to men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance, and thus also the unusual hairdos by famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), or Neymar (Brazil), who can still find more normal citizen in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can form these elaborate hairdos.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairdos who go to the utmost limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts to show each other to show, who can create the exentre Looks, as you can see in the following video (see further videos of current competitions there are public Facebook profile batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, found here an opportunity to exchange young people of them to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad ratings, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the self-looking possibilities have seen dozens of youths that they can seize a profession, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops in the beginning of March to report special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district that we are very proud because of love to the children we built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of "Liebesmessenger" to guerrilla war, "which released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more importantly, people who encounter with affection to affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the young colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the "Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (Briefing for Reconciliation), the young people exhorted to write guerrilla fighters letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country scene was the country of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the Guerillamotion FARC (German: revolutionary forces Colombia) concluded the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was meant to mark the Nobel Peace Treaty as a result that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before Colombia is still a long way, until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakens, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to one of war rhetoric and around the clock had to integrate their weapons in life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company again, which had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred, must now record it into their ranks and support them during construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian" "" "convinced that the young Colombia would join together and help in integrating the integration process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what did they do: even thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign will be 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighters who then to be personally signed.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was held at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureate in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this explained that we love the people who love thousands of love letters, but those who don't forget it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He said he continued to share his love with people this year, most of the most urgently needed.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who now must find their place in society and will show up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, in the context of the campaign more than 2000 letters were collected.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I would never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a United Nations warehouse in Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt, in order to bring the letters to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves as they did previously did to meet the commands of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters full of subswareness from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings come through a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that between lies," told the policy student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the District of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, I brought me a former fighter from the camp of Guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut, where the guerrilla-carburetor live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had afraid to go down, because beside him a man was a MGL-pomegrower, a deadly weapon in the village of Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him," "" "hello, what are they doing now?" "" "he answered," "" "I am a letter that someone written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life Something has written me something like this, so I am looking forward to it. "I suddenly ran tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I thoroughly embraced him, and set me beside the pomegrower.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was praying, it was sorry, all the years of faithful companions of this struggle, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never seen anything else from life as war. he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I would never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Now I've learned to learn how I must deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came into a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up, as already war, and the FARC already existed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC outlines the history of the organisation, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process: "for many years we have experienced the opportunity to develop a political party, we can contribute to a political party to create the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">To overcome this magnitude, it pays out to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people have never found obedience, yet never found obedience, and to recognize that people, which I often have seen as monsters, and even hate people, who were turned over by their habitats and their environment was painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the land lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - even those who killed, and so much damage, can give us something, and a smile and a hug can give us.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former militants answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, commander of the camp in Caldono Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">In Colombia, Colombia became clear that after disarmament peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is imbaldness, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack and take up for their rights, and this is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Now we use the FARC on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology, they belong to all those that dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our post and bring sacrifice, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple, who will defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be forthcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2244">With terrors, activists experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which is like a Damlonal value above the LGBTQ community, is not until overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman of Grozny who has shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us what happened in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ-legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international lines after several months after reports were published, which were subject to the deterioration, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowy Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who suspect queer men and took them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transaction, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was raised, you consciously became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so that she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Cheches had experienced by the sexual intercourse her countrywoman, hunting was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">From fear to her life, she moved to the United States last time.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working on a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a translude that tasted into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone, of whom I thought, he would be a friend of my documents, and spread them everywhere in the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he would be no men more in Chechnya that can remove this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents went through the WhatsApp to the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just a few shopping guarded from my car, I heard of my voice saying: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned upswing, I felt anything in my body, but me didn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a sentence, but this time on chancechnical: "how long will you still escape the family, you shandroeck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I knew the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I know only that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and last final dudes in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had to get caught and started shout.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was braided.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two munden in my right lung swing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which patient experiences were placed - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name, but the physician got up and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian Name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful for him that he has gone respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got drug threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some perfectly unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightfall.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The required time to send me to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked the absurd demands: some said me, I'll prove it, going on top without through the streets; others wanted to change my sex in Grozny, and I say that all my sex had not changed, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how does your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people said once my mother in the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, which does not only have your family, but the whole republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we can't stir you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she laid a snare about the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window got a car with dark windshield and a numbered sign with a 95-dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After that happened for the third time, I was clear that there was something faul.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends check out the numbering plates - it presented itself that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you braided?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I say that I remember them all. they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without register without notice, without notice.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checkered to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not believe it in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you are plugged. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, however, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still trage some traditional delicious elements still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So, I wish to overcome this spiritual barrier, I cannot overcome this barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say always that, as long as my mother is in life, I will do my best to inviolate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatted with camera, I actually give me trouble, like the person who remember them out of their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who has entered into Argun one half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan, he was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he decided not a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So, my I, they probably invite you to worry about the problem with the affected person and at the end there is proof that the so-called "glory" has experienced in the blood of satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still pregnant men now in these secret words?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says, there is just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"" "" "" "if, above all those who have not a rich relatives or who were dropped from their relatives to place Kadyrows dish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are kept there as terrorists can present it later than terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "say," "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and assert, they have attacked a village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people would not have disappeared, but specifically submersible, to radicalize.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a mutation or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm just someone who had been detained in Argun one half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There were nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken her.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was, when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">But now they were not presented as Bandits, but there were no reports about it. we argued that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise did you not allow it to shave this man?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and demonstrations of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always contributed my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already before 2003 I was already known throughout Grozny, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Serious! the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was applied, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to" "" "Civilization" "", "but finally, it was thrown back into the stone period." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored eyelashes, bearing tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of the Sharia has never touched me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and all the city knew it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language, there's a precursor: Kharda ma Kharda. that means "Spare not beyond the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often says to children, if they are fun with sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so just did they keep your eyes closed before you because they believed that you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never stopped me, never fails, and never struck me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnadensage kept?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow joined the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't spoke about us by se, but primarily on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could notice as the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had to be learned and laughed, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time, when I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily increasing.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">Not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much too much in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Besides, I'm still working as activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teetrecffs, gatherings, I buried them to hospital and help them to get eating cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people themselves, when I abhorred my refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's allied.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That's exactly the same as Chetschenen, who wish you with foam before the mouth, that there is no sails with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagesters have which Kabardines have which Russians have also known; on all the planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it's unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque, and in the Ramadan fasten - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think about Transidentified men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trusteer.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin, and will not be ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Do not know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I am doing so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad about it - I know that I myself am myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups were before an increase of self-morden within the poverished Arab Ahwazi fellowship in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestors region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months, there is a strong increase in self-morality.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahlez.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: using permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on 27th August, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi fellowship in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he oppressed for his own support to come up to his family, Ahmadazi-Human Rights groups who want to work and remain anonymously.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video held on YouTube kept the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people were able to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that has been established in August within the Arab Ahwazi-minority, and activists swarn't that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahmad azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month, several other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, SayFalah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a matter in common: they were all family fathers, based on the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and unpolluted, to nourish their families and pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arabic Ahwazi suffer poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where much of the Arab citizens living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to dispute the native Arab population, its habitat to dispute.</seg>
<seg id="2412">Before a century, Arabic Ahwaz was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi's monarchy had taken power and undertook considerable efforts in 1925 to finish the ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran next to oil and gas fields as well as some of the traits and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continue to develop slowly, and the native population gets only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated disease, hunger and dismissings.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime rejected the Ahmad azi Arabs systematically workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a variety of dembs, built water from the Arab regions to the Persian areas where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These demons have only led to destroy the devastation caused by drought and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-youngsters rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian-General Director for cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahmad Ahmadazis who completed elementary school, completed 55% of the secondary school and 45% of the university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and rattle-ethnic discrimination," resulted in a "high rise in the number of self-moral among the young ancestral men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse. the reason is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the adjusting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functional and institutions prefers not to support Arabic workers, the local Arab Ahwazi becomes the access to working possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their benefits and surnames to hide their affiliation to Ahmadazi, as even Arabic name cannot be tolerated, because speaking of Arabic language or traction of Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances, the Arab Ahwazi shall bear, propose human rights activists, before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world awake up and take knowledge.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions, in which many different positions came to the expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"" "" "" "if I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who refer himself as an intersectional Feminists - with Frust." ""</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonders, why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place well-thought scientific and social arguments against me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For instance, in spite of equal education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Still, that women are still under stringent observation, when it comes, what body can do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later in various areas of life on a glass ceiling, and that discrimination moves through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I have double and triple them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I'm a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak of skin color on black transidente women, on black women in the LGBTI community, or on black women from the Diaspora; when I say, on what kind of corporal and verbal movement, many white feminists and white intersectionaries had to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Nevertheless, however, everyone knows that women - all women should come together to take up their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing, "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to speak that, in addition to sexualized violence, formed an institutional form, raciously motivated violence, which we have black women to be exposed to two-fold species.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethics and men made less deserve more than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women have undergone a higher risk in black spans and women with a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I wish that all men and all men have any skin in any skin. on the other hand, I cannot join me as a black woman, in which the white woman likes to take into account of unrighteousnesses in their thinking, who refer to both gender as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and won't be more to fight my citizenship in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which always rejected me and countless other black women and repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner complained in 1851 in her speech: "am I no wife?" and I also refused to sustain an ideology in which the black woman is a humanized essence.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refused to join the groupings, which also absorb through cultural expropriation of our customs and customs to drive their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to gain white women the importance of overcutting of skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to disclose the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are attempting to belisk them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional Feminism was founded to limit women from different origin, and are still conscious of white feminism, and is still the word "Feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">"" "" "" "I will draw it off, full and quite from feminism to join the movement of Womanism, who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, so stubbornly is that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon." ""</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it's more important than ever, that we define black women in our own ideas and we will be created in the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism, tells us that we can defend ourselves to define our own way in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered to make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectionality feminists can be discarded immediately after they have read these lines, please inform you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, by which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm thanks to my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinkey we follow Musa to explain his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to its church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river, whom we had lost when I was a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all the country believe that the decades of war, the construction of dust dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and revised version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" from Kurdish. the article belongs to the number # PorSerMujer (# weilichefraubin), which reports on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her Expartner, who could become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship has spent some time and the police said, her statement would not have to be placed, but more could not do.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena was used for mistreatment, also the responsive display of Ada BÃ¡ez was nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife moved their display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the devil's violence against women, is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women are at all once a ad, they do not receive any support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also depend financially dependent on the men who are mistreated. this also explains why only 20% of women who admit violence to be victims of violence at all, even with criminal prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 punches and Statistical 2 Invisible failure and a legal system which does not undertake part 3 of Paraguayan laws: good approach, lack of application and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really harassed, as many women really harassed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, a social-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various informations and reports, but not even a double-way the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, there were 9600 ads on domestic violence against domestic violence. 70% of them went around violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads came by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence among the peace courts. 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women reported that they were corporal, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">This statistics, however, show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these criminal offences are actually displayed. "for every woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of mental failure, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">For every woman being reimbursed for physical mistreatment, two women, which do not do, "stated at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not a self-existence, criminal prosecution can not be documented as many women of each year of their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists killed at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">After their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days, a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos. but for two years she carried out the psychic violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never thought that I would become victims of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read earlier this I thought that only women's happened to be submissive, because they deceive non-violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric if he ever picked up the hand against them and refused to be a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had dropped so long from Carlos, and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment had at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner had harassed her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe you") that consists of women all in any way victims of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group you can talk to others about their experience, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner ultimately managed to convince her, to persuade them that they were worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She developed a process against its former partner, which developed into an unbearable juridical struggle between Paraguay and their home country, primarily for money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems with the application of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament and became known under the hashtag # PorElla (# FÃ¼ry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# non-Wenders) are part of a campaign on Twitter, supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law is to explain the Female d to a standalone criminal case as already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature has changed in some points to win the deputies for the law, that the way for decriminalization of abortions, which are generally banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had provided, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) proceeding to bear the victims of violence at present, if they just wish to receive a secure vacation, to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the Law is not effective if the legislator has no sufficient financial resources for this:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistrealism is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a remind is supposed to take place, that violence is no longer considered a bit of Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who lies in view of these facts, he testified and bears witness to that the perpetrators brought him.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to be so long as long as it is not considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Act was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed, but among other things, a passage was cancelled because of the partners in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the Aggressor, to attack his sacrifice.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than one year ago the omic authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn because of their reporting about corruption in the Sultans.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he had a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors from Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and submitted before court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman is governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had left his father, Said ibn Taimur, through a coup.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the main ministries in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Defence, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The domination of the sultans is characterized by the hardening efforts of security forces, in particular of domestic intelligence, including press freedom, and human rights defenders, independent journalists, blogger and other activists, to be sober and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restricts peaceful and legitimate operations in human rights systematically and beyond citizens, even activists, in order to express their views over the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, their closure and the arrest of three of her editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman (a total monarchy) since its inception in 2007, until they were prohibited by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, arrested an article entitled "High-ranking Parties," which was published in the newspaper on July 26th, 2016, after corruption in justice and the interference of high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS took the Deputy Editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj, who is acting as editor for Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed on undefined time after the Information Minister had given the statement that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper in all ways, including online, will be banned from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first hearing was held in Maskat the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Tribunal sentenced three journalists to prisons and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted for disorder of the public order, "abuse of the Internet 'and" undermining of the State. "</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of the infringement of public procurement and defamation.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and monpenalties from 3,000 omans Rial (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year occupation against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 U.S. dollars) after having found the use of "Information Security," which could represent a danger for public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">A damages deposit of 5000 omic Rial (13 000 US dollars) was scheduled for Al-Abri and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeal Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after biting his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he will serve his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Chamber also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information on the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court, Azamn again replied, the newspaper looks like before attacks by the omic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January the Minister of Information received a statement that the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister for Information received personally a further statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the Minister surrender an additional time against the decision of the Appeals Court.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman was injured in Oman in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For example, to further injuries, for example, the closure of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of the journalist Al-Haj, an impression is not ready to prepare that the Ottoman authorities will not be ready to make an end to the freedom of press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) demands the British authorities to:</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that is addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need in local medical research, there are two reasons: for a lack of global healthcare sector many medicines and vaccines which cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa have far greater impact than elsewhere, and missing investment in the discovery of this disease by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, while establishing its own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can be favourable for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Center for the Research of Infection Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew in Lusaka, Zambia, in the 1990s, just as the first independent impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, at first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he explored the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and over misunderstandings of the media.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment I focuses on the application of research results. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Furthermore, I rigid an research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion according to the important recent scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only rely solutions to have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists to find projects?</seg>

<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you don't had previously?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interested, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are requirements for special scientific training, starting in each age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social science, computer sciences, big data, research of space, health (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from that.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa towards western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are limited speed, things to do, and the gain access to scientific expertise that represent challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system, that the articles are only accessible to payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how to change "open source" seed manufacturers to change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky appeared initially on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 types, such as Outredder, the first plant, which was cultivated by NASA-Astronauts in space and is consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortal's work was only managed by its own carpetty and the question how many salaries are able to obtain limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more salads were patented, and that he could not continue using them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance levels compared to diseases, a special Rotor, or greased leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more such patents have been registered for more plants, such as cereals or cartel varieties. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental protective and expert for food safety, will ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As passionate representatives of a millennia-long tradition, Morton still farmed lettuce, however, since his work still needs more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, when a boulders river would lie in a river, around whom I have to shrink." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">Now we have to do this, but it's a break with breeding tradition, "says he." I think that these patents have to go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new salads, because all the features are already patented. "he makes it so good as possible and tries to extract the features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavoured to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It is also connected to a movement which is always bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and eaten red Roman salat in the "greenhouse" of the station, where plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It's no coincidence that this name sounds rather than that the movement originate from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" Saatgut) is inspired by the Movement for Free "Open Source" software, providing alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was initiated in order to ensure that some plant types and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, Ossi, US breeders may also undertake that others could use the plant-free from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with its seeds. "open source" breeders allow others to cross their seed, to cross their own varieties, and it is not possible - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Experts from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Saatgut is playing a role in major contexts such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use latter or only little to work with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "who like good, locally and sustainable producing vegetables have to be purchased in August and September 2016, should also know that the way is cultivated on farming markets, like this vegetable consumption is cultivated.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional-confident without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to provide other things at the open source. thus, its occurrence is to be patented in contrast, seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi support will argue that the future of food supplies are endangered because the available group pool due to the increasingly promising intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always limited, unbreakable.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that approximately one-third of all the antiqueries are protected as intellectual property, which means it is not suitable for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass solicated plants like wheat are patented even more than salvets or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visible</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated as well, that they are targeted - of such nutrients through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to those in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders are decreasing by increasingly more patents. however, genetic diversity may currently be more constrained than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than ever since change in climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto is recognisable that genetic diversity is generally important and important for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four Genealogics and co-operation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company set itself the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts that intellectual property supports other breeders, since "patents and protection of plant varietets innovations." "" "a patent is basically taken away as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get into the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibits innovations, but fosters them to provide more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks the different: 20 years to wait until a patent is christening, doesn't burn any innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you're waiting for that long wait for plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton requires that genetic resources always have been a general good and still should remain unchanged: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to simplify farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it will be impossible to use us if we don't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton bothered himself to the concept to patented plant characteristics: "we are creating the characteristics not really.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form the plants themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever creates a variety," "" "who compile their own values in them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures, for which cultivation areas of herbicides are needed, are breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While several medium-sized companies (such as monsanto remain in international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they provide most smaller seed companies - either refuse to reject the cartridge or hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would result by the avoidance of plant patrons of innovative: "it looks like being able to produce new products, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years himself, "says he." with a patent is being protected for 20 years before competition, what makes it easy to make my opinion very nicely. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the U.S. seem to be leading in the "open source" breeding, however, the concept continues to spread rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture,") is described as a professional organization in the area of resources, a "open-source" seed product. the centre with farmers work together and helps them to breeding new varieties to meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to come to "open source" seeds and sell its own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agreements is working on an "open source," which ultimately represents a formal and legally binding form of Ossi-obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations concerning breeding differ from country to country, for which the Ossi obligation cannot be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declares that conventional plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks to the current practice of the European Patent Office, making patents applied to conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is necessary to implement the Member States to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" Saatters and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to experience something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend for patching seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Program for "Open Source" Saatters, "the organisation currently has a global alliance for" Open Source "Saatters, for the scheduled next year of the official start.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seeds, technology and Concentration, in order to publish the Seed Map Project, a Saatgut Map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essential - a consortium of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - it represents that farmers have to cope with seeds which ensure a stable supply of food and food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report also emphasizes the importance of a varied, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection, by the Luby von Ossi hopes to recognize it soon more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological foods have especially been respected, where and how a bit has been added, and saatters have hardly played a role," "" "so Luby." "" "we are trying to declare it even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the newest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Even unlock the Egyptian authorities in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend at the 05th August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network released a statement on Facebook in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step, blurred and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">"" "" "" "the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information permanently, despite this attack and the rejection of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution." "" "it's never confirmed that it was never so important as now. ANHRI also confirmed that all technical possibilities would be exhausted to overcome the blocking, and not. we enviate to fulfill our task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked off the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar, because of the alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site obstructions to the victim. @ anhri has one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the columnists and human rights of human rights Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columnists and articles that he does not accessorate websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he prepared to deal with the Egyptian government, was an attack by the Egyptian government.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, which is native to the Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces, while he reported on the student protests, and recorded a video like the police force of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article is mainly turning politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada said to the lock by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, however, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is managed to convey me the feeling of an aggression; an arrest, a searchable murder, precharge of the national Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) Do not have shown that I wrote for nothing in vain. in other words, my words have influence if only a small audience only.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">At first, I used it to the post of articles to deal with censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they blocked him, and that they may fear him, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The muzzle go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities unlocked Egyptian authorities on 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of suppliers, by changing internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs began, began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice suggests to intend the government's intention to block content and to filter content that could access Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worsened that the government's decisions were hit behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, by which it can proceed against this action.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government prepared with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, that we won't close our eyes as a journalist before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure is:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>

<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>

<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as with the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, Enlightenment and a historical and self-regarded negligible of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the fall of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan started by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups that defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. so Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, belonged to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghan, for the last time with his family together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother had not said it then, she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban were always closer to its hinestones on the Hazara Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coherbbin. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took that of his small wages, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar who were heavier than he himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan Refugees in Iran was influenced by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan Refugees) lived in an empty building on the jobsite that we worked on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we suspended the open window, so that we don't seize at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">At the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered a shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabitated Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Asharaf was homeless, and left alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church that spread twice a day of food.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for the past asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights Organisation of Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in more than 3000 "special reception centres." this is a improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission center if they officially put an application for asylum - what can be used after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, have either instructed to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it came also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his uncomended lifelong helped Asharaf soon coming from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made several years in construction industry for several years, Asharaf earned his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
