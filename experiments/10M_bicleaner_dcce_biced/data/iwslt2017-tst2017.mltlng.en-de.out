that is James R@@ isen .
perhaps you know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he had spectacular , that the N@@ SA heard illegal phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a sustained impression .
he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence service , in which the CIA had literally changed designs for a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , you &apos;ll read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but you know , who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years the government opposed R@@ isen has been determined and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train he became a symbol for the government of government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , and to discuss journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it &apos;s impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the mu@@ te of their identity .
so , when the government at R@@ isen , he did something that many bra@@ ve re@@ porter did before him : he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
therefore , from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days before the process , something exceptional happened .
suddenly , though they were for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ por@@ ters and sources can still be stopped less .
instead of obli@@ ging and circles up to the testimony , it could also do its digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so , the investig@@ ators have wor@@ ried , without his consent , his phone calls @-@ home himself ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ kin@@ ship , his credit information , and even travel links with the list of his flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n a CIA @-@ wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary clear@@ ed more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of her work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower was going to a journalist .
so we put the media communication on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more possibilities to equi@@ val@@ ate all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to re@@ locate the rights of rep@@ tiles , the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can contact the moment , in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ mat@@ h of the stuff .
today , there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist than R@@ isen , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an Open Source Over@@ ture System for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by us by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today working from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I work , developed further .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , so as the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send documents , like in any standard contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the respective news agency .
so the government cannot obtain more information in secret , and many of the information that would like it would not be available from advance .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments are developing new sp@@ ying technologies around the world , who are all endanger@@ ed us .
it is sure to ensure that not only technology ers such as Edward Snow@@ den have the possibility to give ini@@ qui@@ ties . it &apos;s also important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the lack of abuse during the care of soldiers is modest and of over@@ crow@@ ded hospitals . or the next environmental management , the alarm to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime , but to protect all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest Daten@@ l@@ eck of History was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; have been hidden &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have a statement . &#93; this week we were covered by News over a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax h@@ av@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you setup it ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has declined .
also , there are reports that a bund@@ ling of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s letter of tax companies in tax h@@ av@@ ens has .
it claims that a track of $ 2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend from children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be there a lot of rich people and others , who are nervous to the next release , and on the next disclos@@ ed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an e @-@ master builder or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ novel .
it seems far away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be what ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful is able to hide their fortune in tax h@@ av@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for major public services such as health , education , roads .
and this affects us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax h@@ av@@ ens are used by a few days to hide their property and to v@@ eil@@ les -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and unv@@ eil for ten years .
I think so many people appears very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this tax h@@ av@@ ens work .
I always turn to myself like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so , one company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for criminal liability and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably , because there wasn &apos;t any prominent Americans that occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
well , it is not so that there are no rich Americans that can hide their assets in tax h@@ av@@ ens .
but through the principle , after those tax h@@ av@@ ens , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
would we have a data spot from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states there is less information required in some US states to form less information to start a company when you have a library .
this type of transparency in the USA has allowed employees of shoul@@ ders , zo@@ oming in school children .
it has allowed fr@@ aud@@ its to zoom in particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior , which affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator delivered himself as African ministers who wanted to buy a house to buy a house , a yacht with a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked us that all up to a lawyer made our investig@@ ator &apos;s proposals as he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ st@@ resses . none of these lawyers took us as client , and , of course , no one was handed over to him . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as single cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who presented the investig@@ ative investig@@ ator suggestions .
it is not about a single top poli@@ tic , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it is why the system works , through corruption , tax cur@@ sor , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to tackle this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior .
this may sound very trouble , as if we could do anything about it ; as if nothing ever change , it will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see clearly that a lot to change has started .
in the last few years , we have seen advance towards more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the subject was political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then the EU has been captured in central regist@@ ers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA is behind it .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both the parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress I would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax h@@ av@@ ens , is used to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who will see if they see , like other people can hide their true identity behind projectors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need management in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians that reco@@ gn@@ ise the problem and end up by laws these kinds of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finish the In@@ transparent , which now allows this type of tax cur@@ sed , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally ending .
this is the story how I have been kidn@@ apped and in the boot space of a red Maz@@ das landed .
one day after I had completed my design study , I made an office ticket .
a type in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked down my things .
he bought one of my artwork .
he was in the city alone and made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace show .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep ton@@ ight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing still worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just knew him ! he says , he would not say to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
that is a small luggage compartment !
then I heard me say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I wa@@ ited for the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh my husband ! what have I rock@@ ed there ?
a wild alien in my living room .
what if he is mad ? &quot;
I got such fear , that I went out of bed to ti@@ dy , and closed my sleep door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had purchased from me , depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
perhaps people who were sold in childhood in the childhood were friends who are just waiting for waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a time leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my roommate is up and the rent will be increased .
I learned that there was a design conference at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , Cre@@ ativity can create it , anxiety in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have survived , as we could earn a bit like this . our apartment will stay in a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay at us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a web site and set so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood floors .
they found it super , and we also .
I am sure to tast@@ ed our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ let completely different because we made them for our guests .
we t@@ oured with them through the whole city . when we appro@@ ached our last guest and the door fell to the castle , Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends simultaneously and could pay for our rent ?
the things came into rolls .
my former roommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ k@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether one could make a business concept .
so we presented our investors : &quot; we want to make a website dedicated to the people publicly owned by their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are coming over .
you can un@@ load wild people through the Internet in order to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we are waiting that the miss@@ ile would burn .
but did not open it .
no one , who is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned , that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , you get on the things that can be good . we could des@@ ig@@ y .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel - it &apos;s the overall survival .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create through design imm@@ enses , among people who had never met before .
can design make something like ?
is it possible to create with Design Confi@@ dence ?
I would like to give you a dietary sample , which degree trust we stri@@ pped .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your coming one .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
I &apos;d like to know that you un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ lock mobile phone your left seat .
this quiet@@ ly approach from pan@@ ic which you feel now -- -- is exactly what will host when they open the first time .
for the only thing which is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so also the most guests feel if they stay in a different way .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just sometimes so , who really has Al Go@@ res phone ?
could you please call on Twitter that he is president of the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have been presented once again with his name ; if he &apos;d tell whence he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ?
imagine , they had 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments which say all : &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would like to give your mobile phone ?
because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to spend negative opinions .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest published their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we introduced them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we performed a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how probably it is to trust one another , depending on how they look at age and residence .
little unexpected , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less trust we trust .
this is a natural social Vo@@ re@@ ingen@@ ious .
exciting will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if one has less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes .
if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation not simil@@ arities .
so , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you are reas@@ on@@ ably priced .
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you won &apos;t get any answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells me too much , like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; Great works of art ! I &apos;m doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how to establish it with design to produce this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics should you write something .
our entire company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
with which we didn &apos;t think was the great amount of people who were more than ready to submit this pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take our offer in claim .
one can recognize three things .
fir@@ stly : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
business just runs very well for us .
of course , there are times , if not everything goes well .
there were guests who are un@@ permitted parties celebrated or apartments devast@@ ated .
the host will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project , I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the fore@@ front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing more lim@@ mer@@ it than these calls . it &apos;s h@@ urt , if I just think of it .
the dis@@ appointment , which was heard in the voice of the list@@ eners , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further .
fortunately , one of the 123 million people had just a fra@@ ction , each with a problem .
for people trusted by law .
if trust works , there can be mar@@ vel@@ ous .
one of our guests enjoyed vacation in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host went to hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real protective nails that save lives though , even though they don &apos;t know properly .
you drive one in your own car to hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want , that you feel free to get books over .
you can leave an even longer , without charge extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
naturally , every stay does not exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled to this term about this term , I asked me :
how does the idea of the particle fit with money transactions ?
it &apos;s about an economic trading .
but now it simply calls for &quot; rental industry , &quot; the matter will not be justified .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people occup@@ y a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , we compare that with Fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would be , however , if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what would be , if at every place you visited , a group there would be waiting to wait a group there , and one in a K@@ nei@@ pent@@ ine quarter , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn from a five star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from reason to the inter@@ section ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have to accept the thoughts of common parts ?
I establish cities that enable us to relationships and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and depreciation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that were included in the government ,
now residents were offered . students who were looking for a stay in search of a stay ,
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were dra@@ gged out . incub@@ ators have been started ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people will be guest in 191 countries at a stranger , or even hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality was also given before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did it just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we noted that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us to overcome deep pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
down@@ gra@@ cious .
I have to think about it , if a red Maz@@ da goes on me .
we naturally know that design can not solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use it for our design .
thanks .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or is supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ ins under@@ go , a terror woman ?
or just a delay in security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I give you not the bl@@ ame for your negative impressions .
these are the media that look like this , like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting about Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans my , most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met Muslims : it &apos;s great for you to know .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ owner -- double espresso , with whi@@ pped cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practic@@ ing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because baby I was not born so .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ n me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to carry Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head @-@ cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were ent@@ angl@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lus@@ ati@@ ce@@ ful : at that time it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Independence , and against the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the cor@@ als .
I read it , thought afterwards , turned in question , dou@@ b@@ ably and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication , which deep@@ en itself with each reading of Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhyth@@ ms brings me sometimes to wines .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever feel that someone takes you perc@@ ei@@ ving , and somehow loves it ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and began as all the good Egyptians , my career as engineer .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the valley of the Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you will probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , I had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and looked the word &quot; Eil@@ at . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flo@@ ats in buildings , people sp@@ ill out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into ou@@ tra@@ ge quickly .
why should I do such a thing ?
I moved to the TV channel , and heard , ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam , ... &quot; ... &#91; ... &#93; In the name of Islam , ... &quot; ...
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in N@@ u changed the works of others by a citizen in susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to travel through the Middle East of the USA to go into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove myself -- as we sailed -- as deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be the first time as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment in our apartment in a new town in which it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in well @-@ lighted areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed for the whole week .
then , there was Friday in that week -- that day in which Muslims are gathering to prayer .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw me the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who had kept for Muslims in the Free Time and struck .
there were really bran@@ dan@@ es on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because people who had attacked this land , have attacked our country .
I critic@@ ises the rage of people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was too angry .
it is not easy to explain . it &apos;s not easy to explain .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
the alleg@@ ations , that are hard .
nowadays , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church as from a tumor in the body of the United States .
there is only the question : are we mal@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and ben@@ ign tumor only under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ su@@ al because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , educ@@ ators and Olympics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make saf@@ er secure ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque is to be toler@@ ant to people other faith , and show greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the c@@ ops in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in the bed in front of a computer .
when the radic@@ alization process has found that he begins online . as , the person will cut off a bra@@ ins , that the person believes that terror@@ ists may be ab@@ hor@@ red by the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ red their behaviour , and their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or their ide@@ ology .
when we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must take the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
eventually , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
when Muslims , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would conclu@@ de in their imagination if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups asser@@ t their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you cast a look at her , she drives them not , what they say in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is its brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me some amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they can join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him , if they have been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy which she had spoken , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger would cause her mind to un@@ righteousness in the world .
nothing insp@@ ires and something that would have been given to their anger , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation by extrem@@ ists who had a solution .
this Im@@ am set the link to God and its congregation .
instead of acc@@ using them for her anger , he showed constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , and kept them to join the IS .
that was an insight as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
what is the 24 hour consumption of anxiety every day to our democracy on our mind ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ ence studies -- show : when we fear us , at least three things happen .
we accept a author@@ itarian government system , conformity , and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
one study shows : if one report Test@@ ed messages , in which negative of Muslims reported negative attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
when you look at when the s@@ enti@@ ment against Muslims after the upward fail -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it was in the ap@@ ron of Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected it .
it really can be a tool for mani@@ pulation to be the public to em@@ ulate the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we perhaps feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear makes us all .
if collective debt , it is not only going to explain to himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental Faculty , talented , promising , very promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet , most generous human being , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was blo@@ cked and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did I become such a sealed young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne in her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , who was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who had her in the afternoon as he had posted an appearance after Muslims at his Facebook page .
he went on De@@ ah 8 times .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque , or were we safe at home ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision to let us control our children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we would control our children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that would control us through fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which we can exercise our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove to the mosque , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , he left me .
the hall was completely re@@ filled .
then , the Im@@ am Announc@@ ing an announcement , because the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers , who had come to join us , but to join us .
at that moment , I &apos;m collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion on pan@@ ic and pre@@ judi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you sure to go on number ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than that .
thank you .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : thus D@@ alia , you seem to have met a ner@@ v .
but I wonder , what say you think that maybe you &apos;re going to say that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought out with deep @-@ gang , i.e. , an exception , and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , dec@@ eive you not . I &apos;m completely normal .
I &apos;m no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual , as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study about Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want to be prosper@@ ity for the family , they want to work , and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if humans appear as a rule , usually the rule has broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers started shortly before , a one @-@ way business .
monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible , research institutions worldwide is made globally .
before the air @-@ package place in our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bri@@ cks . some years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting the flying tools to achieve high speed and acceleration in narrow space .
you can also build self @-@ extrac@@ ting structures .
they have learned to wear loads with turbul@@ ence , and generally to respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to pass the limits of possibility in an autonomous flight .
so that a system works autonom@@ ously , it doesn &apos;t need to know , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flying machine has internal sensors to determine position in the room , which should determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available in the highest E@@ ben@@ e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; lan@@ den . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a plane , tried to beat two flying with a f@@ lap .
like other strong sail@@ ors it is efficiently , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most of the star@@ ters , it can be bo@@ oming , and makes it great advantages with start @-@ up and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping page .
a restriction of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter in which situation improves the optimal position and can be improved by practic@@ ing .
okay .
during our research , we often constitute basic abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
hel@@ icop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts known to viol@@ ate you .
before decades , trained pilot @-@ controlled flying tools , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ der .
un@@ long we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented a short time .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no c@@ apping , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actuators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , it happens very much , so it can fly stable and can move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to fly to flying , I have to take it exactly .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that is right to throw for me when all , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in com@@ promising , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ri@@ cally .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
he receives the Extra@@ ordinary Sk@@ ability ,
moving in space to move in all directions , no matter where he is turned or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is conc@@ ei@@ vable in models , the rest is moved directly when flying .
let us see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ ellers aircraft .
this is turning clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when one builds them , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ ellers falls out , the electronics or one battery -- can move the machine if also limited .
we will demonstrate that , by making half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we participated commerci@@ ally available Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows , where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you mo@@ tiv@@ ate this demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the especially secure machine because it wants to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology .
for types such as us is the reward in development and the work act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that there are creative , smart creatures allowed to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential , the door blow is on the i .
thank you .
about 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far away galax@@ y , in a very far away galax@@ y , turning two black holes to each other , they walked in a tenth of three seconds in pure energy .
for this short moment , they were brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big boy .
however , they put your energy in the form of light , not --
we finally promise of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
sort the events first time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , most likely life was created on earth .
since then the earth has under@@ gone a lot of cor@@ als : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , humans and -- God , even at -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly Mu@@ eller -- R@@ ai Weiss was decided by the MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a gig@@ antic laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which occur through col@@ li@@ zing black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy Gen@@ ies , that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception , and extremely much hard work , they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ ometer with gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
in the follow @-@ time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could considerably increase the detection capacity enorm@@ ously improved .
therefore , you call him Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a recent test run by some smaller , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only few days after commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of both col@@ li@@ zing black holes caused by the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ gh@@ ter
and the good@@ bye from my to@@ dk@@ ran@@ ken father .
basically , that was the fruits of my life .
all this , what I had worked , is no longer Science Fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their through ob@@ servatory such as L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is an accumulation in the structure of space and time .
by the pass of the shaft , the space and its aggreg@@ ate content will be stretched towards a direction into the other .
for illustration , instruc@@ tors in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often lead a real al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves extremely weak , even ri@@ dic@@ ulous , are .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us stretched out the waves , and the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means that 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st session , one explained the L@@ IG@@ O staff for mad .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser @-@ detector , and it &apos;s already absur@@ d , this length would have to be measured exactly as an thous@@ and@@ ths of a nuclear &apos;s radius . that is Gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text on gravitation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt after waves : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such detectors are tremendous .
but Physi@@ cists are inv@@ ari@@ ous and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O be more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what that means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone .
this is quite practical . for example , you can make a picture or a map of things by using several points coming to you around you .
it &apos;s different at tones .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it &apos;s very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things , which means you particularly much :
your child &apos;s face .
instead we l@@ ur@@ k according to specific properties such as sound and height , rhythm and volume to close the history behind it .
&quot; now speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob supp@@ ose it . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ my Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can provide with them no simple pictures of objects in all .
but by taking changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least there are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area for L@@ IG@@ O .
so when we can convert wave pattern in sound , we can talk the all literally .
the gravitation can listen to us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott had already busy very long .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , circ@@ ulates simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turning two bodies very quickly , one h@@ ears the same circ@@ pen with an additional tone changing . it sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a type of motion detector , st@@ amped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget that L@@ IG@@ O heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of the noise &#93; J@@ any , who knows how to listen to this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which quickly rot@@ ate as soon as the bars of your mixer .
AA : considering ourselves short , what does that mean .
two black holes , the thick@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 pro@@ s , revol@@ ve each second for a second time before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine the forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
therein is the permanent importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O p@@ aves a totally new way to explore the universe , as it was never possible before .
on this way , we can listen to all the invisible and the invisible .
many things we can see -- practically or basically - do not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ie stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about space .
the thr@@ illing physical processes occur at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through , since this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , when it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Creator is being exposed .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to sub@@ lim@@ iting until the beginning .
and the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic , that in all things we have never seen , which we never have seen , and of which we don &apos;t have no idea . things we only discover what we hear .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found out in the first sight of things that we had not expected .
my colleague at the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , like L@@ IG@@ O them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black Hol@@ es are the suction cup for our arch@@ eological work .
L@@ IG@@ O makes us a completely different point of view on the events of the stars , and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible .
thanks L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and lau@@ gh the cos@@ mos of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a completely new generation of ob@@ servatory on Earth and in All .
for what could be more beautiful than to lau@@ gh yourself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
one year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I was afraid .
no matter whether it stopped me nerv@@ ously , I brought me to say in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
wanted to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
do I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start with the scene ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened , exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared my fear .
my fear , to keep talking , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life to an unexpected . it began with a question of my min@@ ds .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all of in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot;
as she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ ching , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me , if I could play with her , when I was just in the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new way of life in my family . from there I sw@@ apped me to play with them once you &apos;re doing . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I say always Yes -- each single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I stri@@ ve to answer me very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a dis@@ concer@@ ted side effects : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; Speak to play with my children I saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think of things , aw@@ aken you for life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create a television . I &apos;m making television .
I make television , in large style .
in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for ensuring that 70 hours of program over the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each programme provides hundreds of jobs which did not exist before .
the budget for a television sen@@ ders can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which at the same time are four , 16 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run succes@@ sively on Thursday night .
all over the world my series are running in 256 languages for 30 million viewers in 67 different languages .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created themselves , and not only produced , so still ob@@ sc@@ ent , creative time to assem@@ ble my fans , and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who still makes it ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
I say it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author falls . &quot;
I say to you all of you who work as hard work , whether you &apos;re now working as a firm , a country or a classroom , that &apos;s what I say , that I say not only when I say , I understand that I don &apos;t understand that with a dream job does not rise from dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no t@@ ears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened to work , there &apos;s no different feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it is when I ordered troops , when I painted on a canvas .
thus , one dre@@ ds a high sound , put a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechanically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , gr@@ illed and reasonable . and the best of it is sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me if the job runs well .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s list@@ ens to an animated road , I could ride forever .
many people take on , if I tell them the sum@@ s that I persu@@ ade to write the letter to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , this does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with TV production when I began to work and to work and work together , I discovered this cause , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t move differently than according to size .
the feeling , not otherwise to be different , regardless of size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only , that I am not for the failure , and I know only that I love the sum@@ s .
I want to tell you only , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want it to question .
in order to make one clear : the more successful I am , the more super@@ imposed limits , the more work , the more work simultaneously , the more things simultaneously , the more time I &apos;m writing , um@@ so much more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love job , isn &apos;t it ?
the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ drive , expanded .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that her mo@@ m is a single work institution .
Har@@ per tells you : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says , &quot; If I would like to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ country . &quot;
there are children of a titanium .
they are baby titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine are silent .
I don &apos;t loved my job anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not return .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 @-@ hour @-@ days , un@@ processed weekends , no re@@ gre@@ t , not deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleep@@ eth not , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me it was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so , what do you do if you do , the work , who loves you , suddenly , do ?
I know , some like thinking : &quot; hypo@@ crit@@ es out , bl@@ e@@ zing the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know , you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re doing , you &apos;d love to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the sum@@ s feel , and knows how to stop the sum@@ s , if the sum@@ s stop ? who then is it ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart h@@ ears , I can survive in the silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutes a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am travelling outside , late and she says , &quot; mo@@ m , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I will already say no , when two things are aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say Yes to everything and second , they didn &apos;t called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call no longer &quot; award . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan Poker and my sum@@ s are sh@@ red@@ ded , and here all changes from my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and lose their sisters , we lau@@ gh a lot and I &apos;m very dramatic from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the Sum@@ mon , can &apos;t do anything but to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country , which I create , the marathon , the I run , the army , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything , what exists are sti@@ cky finger and wet k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax sti@@ p@@ ens and song , in which it works , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; leaves .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly be bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I am at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come slowly .
no full volume , hardly anything , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;ve forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the Titan@@ ens@@ um@@ men , that is just the replacement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I tell you if I am going to tell you who I am managing using programmes and television hours and like working my brain , then I forgot something that is real sum@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the current , which comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , leading tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure .
real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed God the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me I will say Yes .
I do this to a fixed rule , so I can rid me as work@@ ah@@ olic of any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good playing , I don &apos;t like it .
to play , I don &apos;t have to do so as working .
truth h@@ urt ,
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I always work , because I love it .
I am better at the workplace as at home .
this con@@ fes@@ sion is pain@@ ful , for what a man do better working as a house ?
well , yes , I .
I &apos;ll hon@@ est , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed , is none of them .
we ras@@ en around and back , turn and turn back .
we make little dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we grin@@ d soap bub@@ bles .
I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
always take care for my mobile .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe are satisfied .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we ever hear about playing with the games ?
you can also say it ! let &apos;s always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me for n@@ ai@@ v , for one meeting .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show @-@ figure .
your child will find less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they grin@@ d to do something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a lad@@ le bread or bis@@ cu@@ it replaces me .
and speak to me my teen@@ ager @-@ daughter every 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can bring 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad @-@ le@@ une day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no linen , no dist@@ rac@@ tion .
the day is short : dinner , the children have completed .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
my children are my delight , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
around the &quot; Play@@ ing &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what good doing you .
find out and store it .
I am not perfect in it . I fail and I remember . friends meet , read books I enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stand for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not get full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s come back in my free time . sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
works not working without playing .
it needs time , but after a few months , a door opens in my office . I hear me a unknown mel@@ ody , she meets me and my soul . she direc@@ ts me to new ideas . I use it again to his way . I use it in full bre@@ wing and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... not anymore .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinners with friends .
this is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so gr@@ ate@@ ful .
it is me , that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen one Titan , who plays to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my storage fire is still burning .
the more I play , the more lucky I and my children .
the more I play , the more feel the good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er is my head .
the more I &apos;m playing , the better working .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the others , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new life experience in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more white I know who I am .
I am an author . I think of things I aw@@ aken you for life .
that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
that &apos;s the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play .
titanium lets have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ in .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after heavy stroke , or after a car accident .
for our neuro@@ sur@@ geon , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capability for self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a constant , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ ing in neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve function by various surgical interventions .
certainly , they have one of the most well known is &quot; deep @-@ ir@@ c@@ le stimulation . &quot; in this process , you im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits ranging from neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves .
it &apos;s really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time , I was senior physician and worked in the emer@@ ge day and night .
often I have patient with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that at skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure .
to save the life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
for this , one must sometimes remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of taking the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this fabric .
this is not a light task .
leaving the cells from a tissue , it is comparable with all small children who become out of your families .
you need to find the correct food , temperature , moisture and environments to flo@@ ur@@ ish them .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean François Hollande abol@@ ished .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a family @-@ cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ri@@ pe cells .
perhaps you know more of the study lessons that stem cells are un@@ mature cells , which can transform themselves into every cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is astonishing to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they turned slowly , and after a few weeks , they died even .
so , we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like the stem cells , but it was different .
we needed long to understand , where they came .
they come from these cells .
this blue and red cells called hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide the spl@@ itting of the brain .
but why do they remain ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of brain , since we find them in higher concentrations near the brain injury .
this is not so safe .
one thing is however clear -- of these cells we received our family cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables the brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cul@@ tiv@@ ate the cells as exactly as Jean @-@ François did
and then it is mar@@ gin@@ ally striking in order to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we rec@@ alled them at the disposal of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- auto repair transplan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re@@ im@@ ing these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ itate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ ters , we were able to work with keys .
in the first scenario , we re@@ signed the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they had disappeared after a few weeks , they would have been taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a violation of and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells and now remained the cells -- they rising neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show , these small points are these small points . these are the cells that we in vitro , in culture .
we could not stop it here .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkey with a manual skill .
they had to take animal pellets from a tablet .
they made it very good .
when they achieved a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we missed the motor @-@ motor range in the motor ort@@ ex Cort@@ ex .
then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
exactly as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to some degree , exactly as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover using plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recreation , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left side you see the monkeys , which rest spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ ation plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us .
since that time , we &apos;ve found a lot more about these cells .
we can begin to free@@ ze and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , e.g. Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still going to im@@ plan them in humans .
I hope that I can show you soon , how human brain cannot cure the means to heal itself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know anyone who can do it . &quot;
I definitely definitely .
of course , the question , which are the biggest obstacles before starting clinical trials involving human beings can begin .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from this great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- You have completed research and tried permission to get started in the future , how many years will it take until someone can come into hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
it initially depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon ?
then one has to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to choose to perform treatments and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , one has to apply this to a multic@@ entr@@ e study .
you must first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that &apos;s sure it is , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake , as a matter of course .
we don &apos;t see the democracy as the frag@@ ile plant which it is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing conscience .
we believe that capitalism leads inev@@ it@@ ably to democracy .
that &apos;s not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w from Singapore and his great neigh@@ bor in Beijing have proven that it &apos;s possible to have a growing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy appears with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I re@@ represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ am@@ big@@ uous as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- do not influence the austerity @-@ programs that were realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w or the Communist Party of China , or some of my beloved friends who had repeated me when the democracy would abol@@ ished anything .
at this point , I would like to present you an economical model for a real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , the Chinese Communist Party and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ending democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy , our societies are master@@ ing our future and w@@ asted our great new technologies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this subject , I would like to point out to an interesting contra@@ diction that currently threat@@ ens our business opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Scho@@ ol@@ berg , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but only few are known as Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the se@@ al@@ ble savings and corporations , however , that could be too fri@@ gh@@ tened , where it could be productive and bring all the things that mankind is urg@@ ently needed , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the US , England and the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the benefits of goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds like a lot of money , up to it with the 5,1 trillion U.S. dollars , which at the same time spent in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock ex@@ changes and real estate prices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus debt and un@@ productive capital make the twin slip , not equal through the usual market mechanisms .
the result will be stagn@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the United States , Japan and Europe , who would not invest a low overall economic demand , which could not invest a low demand in which they could not invest in which they would not survive , that his son would kill him when he will grow ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally the circumstances leads to that it k@@ ills him to kill him .
that is my hair with capitalism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , developing human talents , and especially all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy solution ?
I think . but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the corporate form , in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , there was a mistake to minim@@ ize the importance of ath@@ ic democracy due to these circuits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisions at the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , and has not only given the right to freedom of expression , but important and decisive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right to freedom of expression was , but important and decisive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they clear@@ ed the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote in question of state issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept a long time --
like a candle , which illumin@@ ates very bright , it is also quickly burned .
however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy increased to free citizens , the liberal democracy based on the Magna Cart@@ a &apos;s values , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling classes .
the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process was de@@ mar@@ gin@@ alized , while the economy -- i.e. the world of the concert -- a democratic @-@ free zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , on which the separation of politics and business began , an in@@ difference between the two , and the economy gradually mig@@ rated to politics .
don &apos;t you wonder why the politicians are no longer so earlier ?
it is not located on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is estimated that they can be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics into the economy is isolated and the areas separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of prey , which nour@@ ishes the animals , of which they nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ved at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is similar with the economy that deterior@@ ated so far from the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of the corporations are growing , political goods are increasing , the overall economic demand is increasing , overall economic demand and corporations are anxi@@ ously to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the greater success of capitalism has the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher will become the twin summit , and so the van@@ guard of human labour power and prosper@@ ity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ produce politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control reserves , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist len@@ ke had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t son@@ ly good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctrine from the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only re@@ produce a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there &apos;s a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism is doing it , being the low @-@ quality , replaced by automation and robots .
the problem is higher , so long and politics are separated into separate areas , the automation of the twin summit , and the social conflicts lower , as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we must re@@ shape the economy and re@@ organisation the economy and politics again , and we ensure that we maintain the re@@ unified field of surveillance , otherwise we will show the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is not , whether capitalism has brought up the technical achievements that he has brought forth will survive -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more interesting question is to be solved by a D@@ yst@@ ok , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something similar to people who are serving people in the machines of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations the sense of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like , like this , &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ copy ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you a brief examples in all of them .
in the company &apos;s sector , please contact a capital market before you deser@@ ves money while you are working and in which your capital works as follows , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is ownership of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and income from proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely overhau@@ led .
no distinction between them which are members of the company , which are not in it , and employees working there , but the company does not belong to those that the company does not belong . no big g@@ aps between investment and don@@ ors , and ultimately no temporary Twin Towers .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government is paying the sum of the country , or the trade surplus of the country in a common fund .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment funds are comp@@ uted .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was , that at that time , the technical means did not implement it .
today we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world , which I describe , is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which they privileged people pre@@ fers , and mar@@ x@@ els because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ o- .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a true democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we decline in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ copy right ?
the answer depends on how we can decide to politically .
it is in our hands , and we are doing better democ@@ rati@@ cally .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : y@@ an@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and business ... do we do this , technological development will generate a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers described as &quot; long term &quot; stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the transmission of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only be dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze , but also the countries whose interest is liberal in liberal democracy .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
as well as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are it too .
Y@@ V : if one is not wir@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a type of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday when dinner the speakers you have very clearly said what you stop from the point of view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there &apos;s a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liber@@ als demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the licence of democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my speech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have limited democracy on policy , while the sector is playing , the area of economy -- a completely democratic and free zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in certain respects , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today res@@ embles the Great Britain of the 19th century .
for -- do you remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill ,
it was especially sk@@ ep@@ tic that concerns democratic development .
what you can watch in China now , res@@ embles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China right now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ashing to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I mentioned that comes .
BG : yes ...
how to look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view@@ point , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say good@@ bye , and continued den@@ y that a massive exploitation line through the Eurozone has ran and continue to be heavily threatened by the development of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first sugges@@ tion was revealed to this den@@ ial --
to make it right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to den@@ y the den@@ ial .
but you know , what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one is trying to receive a economic system that is not able to feel free through political will and auth@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , but if the change occurs , he ab@@ rupt@@ ly ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you have any errors in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a Minister for Finance , or any Minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , claims that he did not have any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest error was to sign the application for extension of the school programme late February .
I believed that there were an hon@@ our@@ able interest on the pages of the money , to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they just wanted to fall out our government , only because they would not want to deal with the euro@@ zone , which ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to stand up that they led a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none from the Tro@@ ika of the Bankn@@ otes that has imposed upon us this policy , &quot; I was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all the , and despite the aggressive ton@@ ic of the conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; towards someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the released aircraft will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have cat@@ astroph@@ ic for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy alone .
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
if we propose the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , it appears to be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the Non @-@ European .
BG : we hope very that you are wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you so you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thanks .

he is 47 years old , slim , has an iri@@ descent and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing shows and content to re@@ produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy isn &apos;t able to choose any thing .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right at this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved .
if your show is valued with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
that &apos;s shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after you have a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there any more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough , what &apos;s going on at the end of the curve .
Roy Price does not take on the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence in order to provide &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean exter@@ mination , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply not insp@@ ire .
so it has to make sure he is really on the right side .
the print is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and re@@ stores them online where you can watch them for free .
and when Amazon &apos;s things are out , you get to know , right ?
millions of viewers look at these epis@@ odes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are ob@@ serving at the watching of this shows .
you &apos;ll be watched by Roy and his team to record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you p@@ au@@ sible , what parts you ski@@ p or jump again .
you collect millions of data to decide on this data then , what show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and it gives up the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many people remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it is only an average show -- in the sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House , at 7.5 -- therefore something over the average , but not just that worked on Roy and his team .
about the same time at another company has pl@@ az@@ ed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy it is always looking for this a super @-@ show and he &apos;s also used data but it makes something different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team st@@ owed the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x @-@ viewer , i.e. the reviews that they give the shows , their course , shows them etc .
then use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows them , what producers , which actors .
when they together had all the parts they went a car and decided to do not a sit@@ com over four transmitters , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x got a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 evaluation at this curve . so exactly there they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very kom@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed .
they connect these many data , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic indicates that all should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision which one meets , then one should make a good decision .
you have 200 years to statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optim@@ izes it by very powerful computers .
the min@@ de@@ est , what you can expect , is good television , or ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time , in which we read more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond the television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in jail .
if anyone is in the United States and in order to ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , the data analysis of this company is likely to determine if a discharge occurs or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of choosing whether a show is good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
this is not always the best results . this is not what a company like Multi @-@ Health System does not know how to use data .
also the data sealed are right wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is possible to predic@@ t the data analysis of the flu , the lim@@ lim@@ men type , predic@@ tions -- by data analysis of Google research .
it was wonderful and was a great news coverage . the success story in a &quot; Nature &quot; magazine .
it func@@ tioned well @-@ free , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was simply not functioning , this once again a sens@@ ation , including the release of the publication in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data saved companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data circ@@ ling in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- a territory where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , like the decision for a cancer therapy
or the evolution of a drug . I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
you need to solve any more complex problem , mainly two things :
as an initial dis@@ assem@@ ble this problem in his individual parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts , assem@@ ble the individual parts together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and assem@@ ble .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assem@@ ble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we have it all : our bra@@ ins .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces res@@ etting once again to summar@@ ize a good dism@@ iss@@ ing -- especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and mind where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they would not have been able to understand why they would not be able to assem@@ ble all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which does not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which they received a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , by contrast , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV @-@ ideas as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision because they always could say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong if data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful .
many of you will become ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or no @-@ question , you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will make it later with a technical demo .
I have taken some decisions in my life , whereby I would have to hear in the night on the ball .
but how you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a lot of extracts as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
then the ball will be kl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger . ultimately it &apos;s right to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel very encouraging that despite the great amount of data is still paying , cho@@ ices to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and do risks .
because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks , with which you will end at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
