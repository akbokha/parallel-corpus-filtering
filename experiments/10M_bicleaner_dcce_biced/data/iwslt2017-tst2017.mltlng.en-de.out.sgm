<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Perhaps you know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he had spectacular, that the NSA heard illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a sustained impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">He describes a catastrophic US intelligence service, in which the CIA had literally changed designs for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you'll read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know, who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government opposed Risen has been determined and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train he became a symbol for the government of government, whistleblower, and to discuss journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it's impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the mute of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government at Risen, he did something that many brave reporter did before him: he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore, from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something exceptional happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though they were for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can still be stopped less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of obliging and circles up to the testimony, it could also do its digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigators have worried, without his consent, his phone calls-home himself,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bankinship, his credit information, and even travel links with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn a CIA-whistleblower and risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary cleared more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of her work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result that a whistleblower was going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the media communication on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government has more possibilities to equivalate all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to relocate the rights of reptiles, the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact the moment, in which they contact, rather than in the aftermath of the stuff.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that didn't exist than Risen, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an Open Source Overture System for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by us by Aaron Swartz, and is today working from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I work, developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, so as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, like in any standard contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information in secret, and many of the information that would like it would not be available from advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments are developing new spying technologies around the world, who are all endangered us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is sure to ensure that not only technology ers such as Edward Snowden have the possibility to give iniquities. it's also important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The lack of abuse during the care of soldiers is modest and of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental management, the alarm to contaminated water from Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime, but to protect all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest Datenleck of History was published.] [the "Panama Papers" have been hidden [what does this mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have a statement.] this week we were covered by News over a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you setup it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has declined.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a bundling of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad's letter of tax companies in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a track of $2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend from children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be there a lot of rich people and others, who are nervous to the next release, and on the next disclosed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an e-master builder or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems far away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful is able to hide their fortune in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for major public services such as health, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by a few days to hide their property and to veilles -- something that we have been discussing and unveil for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think so many people appears very confusing, and it's hard to understand how this tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always turn to myself like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal liability and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably, because there wasn't any prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there are no rich Americans that can hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after those tax havens, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Would we have a data spot from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states there is less information required in some US states to form less information to start a company when you have a library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the USA has allowed employees of shoulders, zooming in school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudits to zoom in particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior, which affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator into the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator delivered himself as African ministers who wanted to buy a house to buy a house, a yacht with a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made our investigator's proposals as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all prestresses. none of these lawyers took us as client, and, of course, no one was handed over to him. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who presented the investigative investigator suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politic, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is why the system works, through corruption, tax cursor, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to tackle this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very trouble, as if we could do anything about it; as if nothing ever change, it will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see clearly that a lot to change has started.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years, we have seen advance towards more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject was political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has been captured in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both the parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress I would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who will see if they see, like other people can hide their true identity behind projectors." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need management in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians that recognise the problem and end up by laws these kinds of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finish the Intransparent, which now allows this type of tax cursed, corruption and money laundering, finally ending.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story how I have been kidnapped and in the boot space of a red Mazdas landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design study, I made an office ticket.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda remained and looked down my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city alone and made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace show.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing still worse, "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just knew him! he says, he would not say to the peace-corps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to be kidnapped in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "How please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I waited for the ceiling and thought: "Oh my husband! what have I rocked there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear, that I went out of bed to tidy, and closed my sleep door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had purchased from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold in childhood in the childhood were friends who are just waiting for waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate is up and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, Creativity can create it, anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have survived, as we could earn a bit like this. our apartment will stay in a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay at us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a web site and set so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure to tasted our cheese ham Omellet completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we approached our last guest and the door fell to the castle, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends simultaneously and could pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blekczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether one could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented our investors: "we want to make a website dedicated to the people publicly owned by their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are coming over.</seg>
<seg id="139">You can unload wild people through the Internet in order to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We are waiting that the missile would burn.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not open it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one, who is still at Trost, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned, that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, you get on the things that can be good. we could desigy.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel - it's the overall survival.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create through design immenses, among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with Design Confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a dietary sample, which degree trust we stripped.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your coming one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">I'd like to know that you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlock mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly approach from panic which you feel now -- -- is exactly what will host when they open the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing which is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also the most guests feel if they stay in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just sometimes so, who really has Al Gores phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please call on Twitter that he is president of the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have been presented once again with his name; if he'd tell whence he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, they had 150 assessments which say all: "he can really hold very well-locked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would like to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to spend negative opinions.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest published their assessments before we introduced them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We performed a study with Stanford. we investigated how probably it is to trust one another, depending on how they look at age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little unexpected, we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social Voreingenious.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">If one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation not similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So, the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you are reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, like "Hi!," you won't get any answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells me too much, like:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- "" "" the request is not accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great works of art! I'm doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to establish it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics should you write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we didn't think was the great amount of people who were more than ready to submit this prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer in claim.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">Business just runs very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times, if not everything goes well.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are unpermitted parties celebrated or apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">The host will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing more limmerit than these calls. it's hurt, if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which was heard in the voice of the listeners, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, one of the 123 million people had just a fraction, each with a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted by law.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, there can be marvelous.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests enjoyed vacation in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travellers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protective nails that save lives though, even though they don't know properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want, that you feel free to get books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can leave an even longer, without charge extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Naturally, every stay does not expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled to this term about this term, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of the particle fit with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about an economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">But now it simply calls for "rental industry," the matter will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People occupy a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, we compare that with Fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, however, if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if at every place you visited, a group there would be waiting to wait a group there, and one in a Kneipentine quarter, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from reason to the intersection?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have to accept the thoughts of common parts?</seg>
<seg id="238">I establish cities that enable us to relationships and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that were included in the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Now residents were offered. students who were looking for a stay in search of a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were dragged out. incubators have been started;</seg>
<seg id="242">"" "" "" "to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people will be guest in 191 countries at a stranger, or even hosts." ""</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also given before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we noted that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downgracious.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, if a red Mazda goes on me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We naturally know that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use it for our design.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or is suppressed, a brains undergo, a terror woman?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I give you not the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">These are the media that look like this, like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting about Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans my, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met Muslims: it's great for you to know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-owner -- double espresso, with whipped cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because baby I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to oun me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to carry Hijab, my head-cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were entangled:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lusaticeful: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, and against the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old felt a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the corals.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought afterwards, turned in question, doubably and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow dedication, which deepen itself with each reading of Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythms brings me sometimes to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever feel that someone takes you perceiving, and somehow loves it?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began as all the good Egyptians, my career as engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the valley of the Egyptian-American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you will probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, I had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and looked the word "Eilat."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes floats in buildings, people spill out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into outrage quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I moved to the TV channel, and heard,... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam,..."... [...] In the name of Islam,... "...</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked, but in Nu changed the works of others by a citizen in suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to travel through the Middle East of the USA to go into a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove myself -- as we sailed -- as deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be the first time as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in our apartment in a new town in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "" "be careful," "" "lead in well-lighted areas," "" "stood not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed for the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then, there was Friday in that week -- that day in which Muslims are gathering to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw me the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who had kept for Muslims in the Free Time and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brandanes on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this land, have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I criticises the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was too angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain. it's not easy to explain.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">The allegations, that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays, we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my church as from a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">There is only the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and benign tumor only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are sensual because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, educators and Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but don't stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque is to be tolerant to people other faith, and show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the cops in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radialized in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or in the bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When the radicalization process has found that he begins online. as, the person will cut off a brains, that the person believes that terrorists may be abhorred by the true Muslims, and everyone who abhorred their behaviour, and their ideology, is a traitor or their ideology.</seg>
<seg id="336">When we want to prevent radicalisation, we must take the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Eventually, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslims, as a mother, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would conclude in their imagination if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups assert their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you cast a look at her, she drives them not, what they say in their" Holy Scriptures "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brutality that they can read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me some amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they can join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him, if they have been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy which she had spoken, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger would cause her mind to unrighteousness in the world.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspires and something that would have been given to their anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalisation by extremists who had a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the link to God and its congregation.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for her anger, he showed constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, and kept them to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">What is the 24 hour consumption of anxiety every day to our democracy on our mind?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: when we fear us, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept a authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if one report Tested messages, in which negative of Muslims reported negative attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look at when the sentiment against Muslims after the upward fail -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It was in the apron of Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It really can be a tool for manipulation to be the public to emulate the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We perhaps feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear makes us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">If collective debt, it is not only going to explain to himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental Faculty, talented, promising, very promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most sweet, most generous human being, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was blocked and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did I become such a sealed young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, who was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who had her in the afternoon as he had posted an appearance after Muslims at his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He went on Deah 8 times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque, or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"" "" "" "we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision to let us control our children," "" "that we would control our children," "" "one that would control us through fear," "" "in which we can exercise our religion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove to the mosque, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, he left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely refilled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, the Imam Announcing an announcement, because the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers, who had come to join us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment, I'm collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion on panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you sure to go on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: thus Dalia, you seem to have met a nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder, what say you think that maybe you're going to say that you are a TEDTalk, a thought out with deep-gang, i.e., an exception, and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, deceive you not. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I'm no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual, as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study about Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to be prosperity for the family, they want to work, and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If humans appear as a rule, usually the rule has broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters started shortly before, a one-way business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. possible, research institutions worldwide is made globally.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air-package place in our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting the flying tools to achieve high speed and acceleration in narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-extracting structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads with turbulence, and generally to respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to pass the limits of possibility in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system works autonomously, it doesn't need to know, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flying machine has internal sensors to determine position in the room, which should determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available in the highest Ebene. g. "start" and "landen."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane, tried to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other strong sailors it is efficiently, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most of the starters, it can be booming, and makes it great advantages with start-up and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter in which situation improves the optimal position and can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often constitute basic abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts known to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Before decades, trained pilot-controlled flying tools, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a rear ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented a short time.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No capping, hinges and Querruder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens very much, so it can fly stable and can move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to fly to flying, I have to take it exactly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood that is right to throw for me when all, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in compromising, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">He receives the Extraordinary Skability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space to move in all directions, no matter where he is turned or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is conceivable in models, the rest is moved directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate twin-propellers aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is turning clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a motor or propellers falls out, the electronics or one battery -- can move the machine if also limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that, by making half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated commercially available Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows, where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate this demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine because it wants to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us is the reward in development and the work act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, smart creatures allowed to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential, the door blow is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">About 1.3 billion years ago, in a very far away galaxy, in a very far away galaxy, turning two black holes to each other, they walked in a tenth of three seconds in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they were brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">However, they put your energy in the form of light, not --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally promise of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time-structure itself, and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Sort the events first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, most likely life was created on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has undergone a lot of corals: corals, fish, plants, saurier, humans and -- God, even at -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly Mueller -- Rai Weiss was decided by the MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a gigantic laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which occur through collizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy Genies, that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception, and extremely much hard work, they built the detector LIGO: the laser-interferometer with gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-time, the precision of LIGO could considerably increase the detection capacity enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, you call him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a recent test run by some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only few days after commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of both collizing black holes caused by the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye from my todkranken father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, that was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked, is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational waves of black holes and their through observatory such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is an accumulation in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">By the pass of the shaft, the space and its aggregate content will be stretched towards a direction into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, instructors in courses for relativity theory often lead a real albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us stretched out the waves, and the elongation of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means that 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st session, one explained the LIGO staff for mad.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser-detector, and it's already absurd, this length would have to be measured exactly as an thousandths of a nuclear's radius. that is Grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt after waves: "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But Physicists are invarious and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO be more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for example, you can make a picture or a map of things by using several points coming to you around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It's different at tones.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it's very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things, which means you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we lurk according to specific properties such as sound and height, rhythm and volume to close the history behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob suppose it."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummy Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can provide with them no simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by taking changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least there are the measured frequencies in the audible area for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we can convert wave pattern in sound, we can talk the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation can listen to us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott had already busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circulates simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning two bodies very quickly, one hears the same circpen with an additional tone changing. it sounds like that: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of motion detector, stamped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget that LIGO heard the following: [Surrender of the noise] Jany, who knows how to listen to this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which quickly rotate as soon as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: considering ourselves short, what does that mean.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the thickest body in all, one with a mass of 29 sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 pros, revolve each second for a second time before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine the forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein is the permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a totally new way to explore the universe, as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to all the invisible and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Many things we can see -- practically or basically - do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserie stars in super-novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The thrilling physical processes occur at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, since this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, when it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the Creator is being exposed.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to sublimiting until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I'm optimistic, that in all things we have never seen, which we never have seen, and of which we don't have no idea. things we only discover what we hear.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found out in the first sight of things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, like LIGO them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black Holes are the suction cup for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO makes us a completely different point of view on the events of the stars, and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks LIGO we know how to build great detectors and laugh the cosmos of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a completely new generation of observatory on Earth and in All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to laugh yourself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year I would say to all "Yes!" I was afraid of whom I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it stopped me nervously, I brought me to say in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Do I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start with the scene?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened, exactly that to do, wovor I feared my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to keep talking, my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life to an unexpected. it began with a question of my minds.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls all of inexplicable reasons, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As she would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "Sweethearching, I need milk for my beak-course." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked me, if I could play with her, when I was just in the go. and I said," "" "yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new way of life in my family. from there I swapped me to play with them once you're doing. no matter what I'm doing, or whither I go, I say always Yes -- each single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I strive to answer me very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a disconcerted side effects: only recently I understood that the "Yes" Speak to play with my children I saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think of things, awaken you for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create a television. I'm making television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season, I am responsible for ensuring that 70 hours of program over the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each programme provides hundreds of jobs which did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a television senders can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which at the same time are four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run successively on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series are running in 256 languages for 30 million viewers in 67 different languages.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created themselves, and not only produced, so still obscent, creative time to assemble my fans, and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, if the word "author falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you all of you who work as hard work, whether you're now working as a firm, a country or a classroom, that's what I say, that I say not only when I say, I understand that I don't understand that with a dream job does not rise from dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened to work, there's no different feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I ordered troops, when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">Thus, one dreds a high sound, put a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, grilled and reasonable. and the best of it is sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the job runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums listens to an animated road, I could ride forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take on, if I tell them the sums that I persuade to write the letter to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, this does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started working with TV production when I began to work and to work and work together, I discovered this cause, this sums, this energy. the sum!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't move differently than according to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not otherwise to be different, regardless of size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only, that I am not for the failure, and I know only that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I want to tell you only, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want it to question.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make one clear: the more successful I am, the more superimposed limits, the more work, the more work simultaneously, the more things simultaneously, the more time I'm writing, umso much more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love job, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, overdrive, expanded.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that her mom is a single work institution.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells you: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "If I would like to go to Shonda-country."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine are silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't loved my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not return.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanen work, 15-hour-days, unprocessed weekends, no regret, not delegate, a Titan sleepeth not, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me it was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, what do you do if you do, the work, who loves you, suddenly, do?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some like thinking: "hypocrites out, blezing the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you're doing, you're doing, you'd love to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the sums feel, and knows how to stop the sums, if the sums stop? who then is it?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart hears, I can survive in the silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states" "" "constitutes a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">I am travelling outside, late and she says, "mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will already say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say Yes to everything and second, they didn't called" "" "reward." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no longer "award."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan Poker and my sums are shredded, and here all changes from my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and lose their sisters, we laugh a lot and I'm very dramatic from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the Summon, can't do anything but to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, the I run, the army, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything, what exists are sticky finger and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax stipens and song, in which it works, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" leaves.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly be breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly anything, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we've forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the Titanensummen, that is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">"" "" "" "if I tell you if I am going to tell you who I am managing using programmes and television hours and like working my brain, then I forgot something that is real sums." ""</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the current, which comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, leading tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">Real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered God the false words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this to a fixed rule, so I can rid me as workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">To play, I don't have to do so as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">Truth hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, for what a man do better working as a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">I'll honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen around and back, turn and turn back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make little dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We grind soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">Always take care for my mobile.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we ever hear about playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let's always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me for naiv, for one meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-Show-figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they grind to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a ladle bread or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak to me my teenager-daughter every 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, there is no need for more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad-leune day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no linen, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children have completed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drin!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my delight, my world. it must not be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>

<seg id="761">Find out what good doing you.</seg>

<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not get full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums come back in my free time. sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works not working without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It needs time, but after a few months, a door opens in my office. I hear me a unknown melody, she meets me and my soul. she directs me to new ideas. I use it again to his way. I use it in full brewing and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums is not I... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinners with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me, that I am a Titan. I've never seen one Titan, who plays to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my storage fire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more lucky I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more feel the good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I'm playing, the better working.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the screens, the sums, the sums, the others, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, beating, naked and new life experience in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more white I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am an author. I think of things I awaken you for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That's the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanium lets have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurin.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after heavy stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For our neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a constant, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosuring in neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve function by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have one of the most well known is "deep-ircle stimulation." in this process, you implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits ranging from neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It's really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time, I was senior physician and worked in the emerge day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I have patient with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that at skull-Hirn-Traumata the brain swells and the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save the life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this, one must sometimes remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of taking the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this fabric.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a light task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Leaving the cells from a tissue, it is comparable with all small children who become out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the correct food, temperature, moisture and environments to flourish them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean François Hollande abolished.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a family-cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know more of the study lessons that stem cells are unmature cells, which can transform themselves into every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is astonishing to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They turned slowly, and after a few weeks, they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So, we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like the stem cells, but it was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand, where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">This blue and red cells called hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they provide the splitting of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of brain, since we find them in higher concentrations near the brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is however clear -- of these cells we received our family cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells as exactly as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then it is marginally striking in order to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we recalled them at the disposal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- auto repair transplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reiming these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimitate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Routers, we were able to work with keys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we resigned the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they had disappeared after a few weeks, they would have been taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a violation of and reimplanted the same cells and now remained the cells -- they rising neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show, these small points are these small points. these are the cells that we in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop it here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkey with a manual skill.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take animal pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable level of dexterity, we missed the motor-motor range in the motor ortex Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously up to some degree, exactly as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover using plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recreation, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkeys, which rest spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we've found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can begin to freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, e.g. Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still going to implan them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I hope that I can show you soon, how human brain cannot cure the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know anyone who can do it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question, which are the biggest obstacles before starting clinical trials involving human beings can begin.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from this great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- You have completed research and tried permission to get started in the future, how many years will it take until someone can come into hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">It initially depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then one has to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to choose to perform treatments and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, one has to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that's sure it is, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake, as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see the democracy as the fragile plant which it is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging conscience.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That's not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing have proven that it's possible to have a growing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy appears with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I rerepresented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- do not influence the austerity-programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my beloved friends who had repeated me when the democracy would abolished anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present you an economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and even the Eurogroup of a mistake," "" "we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defending democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy, our societies are mastering our future and wasted our great new technologies." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">"" "" "" "for this subject, I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our business opportunities." ""</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-paradox" paradox. "</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schoolberg, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few are known as Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the sealble savings and corporations, however, that could be too frightened, where it could be productive and bring all the things that mankind is urgently needed, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the US, England and the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the benefits of goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">"" "3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds like a lot of money, up to it with the 5,1 trillion U.S. dollars, which at the same time spent in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchanges and real estate prices." ""</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital make the twin slip, not equal through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result will be stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the United States, Japan and Europe, who would not invest a low overall economic demand, which could not invest a low demand in which they could not invest in which they would not survive, that his son would kill him when he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally the circumstances leads to that it kills him to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, developing human talents, and especially all the technologies to finance, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, there was a mistake to minimize the importance of athic democracy due to these circuits.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decisive" "" "decisions at the Athenian democracy, and has not only given the right to freedom of expression, but important and decisive" "" "the right to freedom of expression was, but important and decisive" "" "that they cleared the right to political co-determination with the same vote in question of state issues." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which illuminates very bright, it is also quickly burned.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy increased to free citizens, the liberal democracy based on the Magna Carta's values, which ultimately became a statute for ruling classes.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process was demarginalized, while the economy -- i.e. the world of the concert -- a democratic-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since the time, on which the separation of politics and business began, an indifference between the two, and the economy gradually migrated to politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Don't you wonder why the politicians are no longer so earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not located on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is estimated that they can be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics into the economy is isolated and the areas separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's like a herd of prey, which nourishes the animals, of which they nourishes, decimated that they are starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "it is similar with the economy that deteriorated so far from the self-caused economic crisis itself." "" "the power of the corporations are growing, political goods are increasing, the overall economic demand is increasing, overall economic demand and corporations are anxiously to invest the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">The greater success of capitalism has the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher will become the twin summit, and so the vanguard of human labour power and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must reproduce politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" control reserves, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist lenke had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't sonly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "the doctrine from the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only reproduce a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">But there's a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it, being the low-quality, replaced by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is higher, so long and politics are separated into separate areas, the automation of the twin summit, and the social conflicts lower, as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so, we must reshape the economy and reorganisation the economy and politics again, and we ensure that we maintain the reunified field of surveillance, otherwise we will show the film" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">"" "" "" "the question is not, whether capitalism has brought up the technical achievements that he has brought forth will survive --" ""</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is to be solved by a Dystok, similar to that in "Matrix," or something similar to people who are serving people in the machines of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," in long conversations the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like, like this, "Star Trek" like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar dystcopy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you a brief examples in all of them.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company's sector, please contact a capital market before you deserves money while you are working and in which your capital works as follows, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is ownership of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and income from proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between them which are members of the company, which are not in it, and employees working there, but the company does not belong to those that the company does not belong. no big gaps between investment and donors, and ultimately no temporary Twin Towers.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by IMF [International Monetary Fund], and G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of the entire humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call them "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and every government is paying the sum of the country, or the trade surplus of the country in a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment funds are computed.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was, that at that time, the technical means did not implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in the background of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I describe, is at the same time liberated, in which they privileged people prefers, and marxels because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan history, and Keynesian, global keynesio-.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we decline in a "Matrix" - similar dystcopy right?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we can decide to politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we are doing better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "" "" "the reason for reunification of politics and business... do we do this, technological development will generate a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers described as" long term "stagnation." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As well as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are it too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if one is not wirr, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a type of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday when dinner the speakers you have very clearly said what you stop from the point of view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>

<seg id="994">In certain respects, if I may say this provocative, China today resembles the Great Britain of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do you remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- that's an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill,</seg>
<seg id="997">It was especially skeptic that concerns democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can watch in China now, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China right now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smashing to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I mentioned that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How to look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal viewpoint, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely, to say goodbye, and continued deny that a massive exploitation line through the Eurozone has ran and continue to be heavily threatened by the development of the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion was revealed to this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">To make it right. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know, what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one is trying to receive a economic system that is not able to feel free through political will and authitarianism, but if the change occurs, he abruptly abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any errors in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister for Finance, or any Minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in a so-called situation, claims that he did not have any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest error was to sign the application for extension of the school programme late February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there were an honourable interest on the pages of the money, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to fall out our government, only because they would not want to deal with the eurozone, which ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to stand up that they led a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It's worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None from the Troika of the Banknotes that has imposed upon us this policy, "I was a colossal mistake."</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision, the Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an iridescent and describes herself on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing shows and content to reproduce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy isn't able to choose any thing.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right at this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">That's shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all shows that are addictive, where, after you have a season, your brain asks, "Where are there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough, what's going on at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take on the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence in order to provide "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean extermination, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are simply not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So it has to make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something that's why Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and restores them online where you can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon's things are out, you get to know, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observing at the watching of this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You'll be watched by Roy and his team to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pausible, what parts you skip or jump again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide on this data then, what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "" "" "in fact, they collect the data, process this and it gives up the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many people remember this show, because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House, at 7.5 -- therefore something over the average, but not just that worked on Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company has plazed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly like Roy it is always looking for this a super-show and he's also used data but it makes something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team stowed the existing data on the Netflix-viewer, i.e. the reviews that they give the shows, their course, shows them etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows them, what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they together had all the parts they went a car and decided to do not a sitcom over four transmitters, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix got a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 evaluation at this curve. so exactly there they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very kompetitive, data sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic indicates that all should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision which one meets, then one should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years to statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimizes it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeest, what you can expect, is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis doesn't work, then this is something terrifying because we live in a time, in which we read more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone is in the United States and in order to ask for dismissal, the data analysis of this company is likely to determine if a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of choosing whether a show is good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">This is not always the best results. this is not what a company like Multi-Health System does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data sealed are right wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is possible to predict the data analysis of the flu, the limlimmen type, predictions -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It was wonderful and was a great news coverage. the success story in a "Nature" magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It functioned well-free, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it was simply not functioning, this once again a sensation, including the release of the publication in" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data saved companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data circling in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- a territory where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, like the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the evolution of a drug. I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">You need to solve any more complex problem, mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As an initial disassemble this problem in his individual parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts, assemble the individual parts together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and assemble.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we have it all: our brains.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces resetting once again to summarize a good dismissing -- especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and mind where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they would not have been able to understand why they would not be able to assemble all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which they received a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, by contrast, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV-ideas as they chose "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision because they always could say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">This did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong if data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will become...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question, you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "probably this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will make it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have taken some decisions in my life, whereby I would have to hear in the night on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But how you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a lot of extracts as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Then the ball will be klüger and klüger and klüger. ultimately it's right to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel very encouraging that despite the great amount of data is still paying, choices to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and do risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you will end at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
