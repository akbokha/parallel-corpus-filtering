Munich 1856 : four cards that change your look at the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where you@@ ths should meet today .
a cryp@@ tic chapel , which is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
gar@@ den@@ ers manage the ru@@ sty ground of pe@@ as@@ ants .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s anno@@ ying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
that knows everybody who had to have had to play a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the Digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an area of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , are everything other than the current - but is therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then there will be clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Mercury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ I , which one can not recognize as such .
in the Great Super@@ vis@@ ors for cities and municipalities , more detailed maps , so @-@ called primi@@ tive leaves have been incorporated .
the first survey of the Bavarian State Surv@@ ey@@ ors were created between 1810 and 1864 and decre@@ asing the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon requested a survey of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey Bay@@ erns on behalf of course for military purposes .
even when the French troops moved with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours , who car@@ ved the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph goes further ahead , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian State Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the composition of Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all other items on the Bay@@ erische Staatsoper &apos;s website .
the comparison of early / today is most impressive in the capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ mer@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was donated 21 years after the drawing of the card , i.e. 1877 , as the Munich district .
today Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ trac@@ ing focus around 1856 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bavarian farmers in Austria 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is , there is nothing more than fields - at first sight : when entering into the first glance a small @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ination , &quot; derived from the base tax .
small plots prove there today no farmers more - but the gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green space is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 scene of the Ok@@ tober@@ f@@ ests , was actually a meadow and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the context of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the context of today &apos;s district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , you can not just read the street names &quot; at the Gast@@ ens &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you un@@ locked man with mad@@ ness .
in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &apos; was created on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders .
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was advanced to his time and ended for example the dressing of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he is prohibited to apply force violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has occupied an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
some@@ time this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circ@@ us institute in hair 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s .
young people are now meeting in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um at the area of former auc@@ tions .
the Order acquired the complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth house with training facilities .
west is the pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residence in the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in an architectural reference to the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 1856 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Head Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merchants called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies broke out many holes in the city centre .
a big remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ tic chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at Mari@@ enhof , where these days work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights published travel war@@ nings for Missouri
the National Association for the Adv@@ ancement of Far@@ ming has issued a warning for colored people , based on discrimination policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which aims to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , ur@@ ges country @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of frag@@ ment@@ ing , road @-@ based pre@@ cases occur throughout the state and here , &quot; said in the opinion of the Group .
a recently approved law of Missouri , which makes people he@@ avier , discrimination @-@ discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ uting authorities of the state , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately on minorities , said the group to release the travel war@@ nings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of the civil rights which people will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are buried because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency , which we haven &apos;t heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group reported incid@@ ents like rac@@ ist persec@@ utions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders died in frag@@ ment@@ ing circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline more by the state and was accused by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council also shows a recent report of the Office of Missouri &apos;s Office of Missouri , where black car drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ iten@@ ess .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that human beings are aware of and their families , friends and employees , what could happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring out their money money , or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ ver@@ bi@@ al report of the FB@@ I , who sett@@ le the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Act that would make it difficult to lay a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the States immigration laws had to under@@ take people because of immigration authorities , which will contribute to further rati@@ fication .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent days , stakeholders have been applied to reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
crossover project is elementary
the Wei@@ her@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n @-@ Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU @-@ German par@@ l@@ ord@@ ed Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have provided a painting on the spot .
together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties , representatives of the CDU @-@ outskirts of the family Schwen@@ demann met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann , initially acquired insights into his operation in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest cultivated , 40 dairy c@@ ows and also many young dogs and houses five apartments arranged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ Mil@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his c@@ ows , so Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Panama &apos;s table tennis table comes exclusively regional .
since he is also called BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman from Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he described the &apos; elementary project as &quot; el@@ ement@@ ar . &quot;
I can &apos;t profit on such areas .
the green area should be processed for much work , many m@@ ills with the motor sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ istic operation and management of this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers , also being able to conduct bio@@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider is clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the dec@@ anter project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers in the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare would have to be supported .
one hope that the surface of the land could still be und@@ ressed as a whole w@@ rop@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture , and thoughts are making their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often standing in criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the opening area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be stopped until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half of the leader was funded by the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
consequently , the farmers stay for 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of wheat de@@ bri@@ s .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and Far@@ ming it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scapes Zone ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of past@@ oral care .
the aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
a prerequis@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ recorded promot@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the un@@ f@@ law@@ less area should be non @-@ deduc@@ tible ( slope up to 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application is currently running on the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 km of fence .
the opening area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs of more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty now
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is , when they start to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these equally as every other - therefore the sor@@ row@@ ed down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s Fir@@ m place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew certainly what he did , when he did a symbolic act in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the exp@@ o @-@ restriction of the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators have asked him if he had done it .
but he took their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to her , as the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , the world light@@ ens .
the po@@ em , which you refer to , which was added later and not part of the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the stum@@ bl@@ est of the poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Your labor , your poor , and your dist@@ ress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to bre@@ athe freely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the waste of your rich coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was never a time to look better in the &quot; el@@ eventh waste &quot; on our screens .
don &apos;t care in literary criticism - he clearly made that those people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a bro@@ ader political and cultural con@@ frontation : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who use their words to place their death after their death , did not know that they have completed a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show links between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism , in an un@@ used classical image representation the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus modified this meaning : in their po@@ em is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and there himself is a very different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the po@@ em with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a dis@@ ast@@ rous attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change this long wing in the right wing .
the great terror as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no longer an early neo @-@ conservative , that bring American flame into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is prog@@ ressing .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine through the way into the United States . &quot;
pretty unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh to stum@@ ble here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
the great @-@ imagin@@ ative approach of Lazarus was composed of Lazarus in it , as they seen from the exhau@@ sted , el@@ eventh , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of Shi@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your statue speaks to them the words of hope and will of the welcome which they have to hear .
and that is , of course , don &apos;t reco@@ gn@@ ise the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch should not shine through the way , but the hat@@ red that is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ aves Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two carr@@ ots belonged to the United Kingdom &apos;s team .
the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Championship can make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that something has done with him what they did .
the Scottish athletes think that it has done something to do with what they did .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen to Team &apos;s team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
their captain speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , regardless of it , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and genuine sens@@ ation that E@@ ili@@ ie were quite natural , were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal winner , which is in their fifth world championships for the 400 m hur@@ dles , says it &quot; incredibly &quot; is that 16 sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
in this way , Mu@@ ir runs on this path and has positioned in five British and two European records last year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to observe the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle reminds on her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team capit@@ alists says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud of &quot; the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also among medals and in the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is special about team capit@@ alists , so that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that anyway , my team colleagues have voted for me and voted for me something very special for me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the carr@@ ots that belong to the team .
it shows just how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ des .
what my speech concerns as captain ?
yes , I think they went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home Championships .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and benef@@ iting from that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it &apos;s just like that a great atmosphere there will be outside . &quot;
blocking of Cri@@ tics about Facebook : ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ vel not to a public office if you don &apos;t toler@@ ate the v@@ oters of v@@ oters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him for everything , from the Domestic Policy to his political principles .
he ch@@ imp@@ ed in criticism , safe .
but he does not have his critic to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , du@@ mm , and silent , as sheep are led to the battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work for more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ an &apos;s employees have blo@@ cked the contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union condem@@ ns him in the beginning of this week .
the Staff of the governor dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ action with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if there is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor , in an overwhelming democratic state who is amazing .
he has the dou@@ ble@@ ed approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he showed a firm hand in leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as primary means to combine with his v@@ oters and play his hair@@ less head to chemotherapy on his page .
therefore , blocking of those who come to the Govern@@ ors page - which is officially designated as official , and by employees who are paid to public tax @-@ Dollars , un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended H@@ og@@ an Inter@@ im Inter@@ im Ch@@ asse the activities of the governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing further than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of Tro@@ l@@ les or sp@@ ik@@ ers or bo@@ iling people that sw@@ inging online .
the post said with some of the real people who were blo@@ cked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a past@@ or , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful , and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented , that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people on the same subject &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; then they are considered a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employee of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a lot more clean when you have done that staff have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control articles and to be burned up or demonstr@@ ators to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but exactly what happens especially digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , who is critic@@ ised for it to imp@@ lies Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users , blo@@ cked by Twitter feeds .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County , injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , known to have a v@@ oters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable portrait had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers often spread between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mail@@ ens based on his leadership .
even then Washington had anonymous troub@@ les .
the people , the pseud@@ ony@@ ms , like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; used , wrote all the letters to newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised its position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom , overwhel@@ med his position , according to historical documents , collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not brought her to silence .
freedom of expression , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true guide means to accept this .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed it again , and I played a solid Golf .
I &apos;m glad , as far as far . &quot;

scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) comes to this result in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases can be attributed to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved to this issue in 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases for pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections proves itself as a very complex
the construction work on the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; reas@@ on@@ ably priced at the time , &quot; says leader of the Bau@@ ho@@ fs Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the house of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the basement there is much out@@ berge , which was not given in the plans .
the traffic , which always hin@@ der the construction works , represents a big issue for the part of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers from red traffic lights and shut@@ ters is already enorm@@ ously , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the street is closed and only the buses are eligible for passage through .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p company has been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days had already quite exhau@@ sting .
but fortunately , we were powered by our friend Fritz Matt with cool water , &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , they don &apos;t use a cooker .
they even use rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai ra@@ iny in the province of Pap@@ ua , puts the house@@ wife normally a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the stolen bun@@ ny will be taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where they also runs their daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from nearby sum@@ p .
a bu@@ cket in a hom@@ eless space is served as a lan@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of their husband their families were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is usually common .
of course , it can be dangerous to work dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one goes on , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it .
it is a rare overview of the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 according to a controversial referendum in Indonesia than 1.0@@ 26 Ol@@ der should vote against the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement used for independence against the Dutch dom@@ ination , quickly turned to the government of Jakarta that maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the Province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that involved the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a 5 @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the town with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by b@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ ene trees , and from corrugated boxes have been converted by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few In@@ don@@ esians have made their journey here , soft journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , the Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans conf@@ essed a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ ust@@ omed to bear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates their lively , hand woven Tur@@ ban , you dark shirts and their bright rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had only leaves on our body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is just 60 miles away from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country province in New Jersey , with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort released gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources in value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are , however , a source of the eleven for Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powers preser@@ ves a sti@@ cking presence .
a study conducted by 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort has paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , among them up to 150,000 US dollars to one single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic recei@@ v@@ ables according to larger autonomy are thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been tor@@ tured by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass mortality in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe high@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1970 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were issued in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ ocese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year contain , such as illegal backgrounds and torture - ra@@ pe and ra@@ kes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal ra@@ inf@@ all of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incid@@ ents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensi@@ fied , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes , since Muslim char@@ gers come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning @-@ cant@@ een sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , served a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ide sauce .
local people will fight for this .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; says Ab@@ eth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local in the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the mo@@ m @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market cost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in folk music and j@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and the legal violation in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we approved in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that righteousness is restored , &quot; says you .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the ro@@ cking children said to them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took the im@@ pet@@ us to her tone and later returned to four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , dr@@ unk , had said , and struck the group with their def@@ ences , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
a child who was 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so bad@@ ly sm@@ itten that he fell into the com@@ a .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set to fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ated next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military commander of justice .
they contributed cerem@@ onial fighters and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in circle continuously and a bird @-@ ser@@ iti@@ zing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began stones at police and military post .
when the s@@ enti@@ ment was heated , the soldiers was sent a command of an internal wireless : &quot; if the masses are more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; is not released in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released in the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening risk and called for peace and called for the crowd returning home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I revol@@ ted me , I suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
k@@ ay@@ ame knows still not , who fired , but says that the ball met from the ranks of here gathered soldiers .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the s@@ und@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran@@ ged to him , and sought his body to be sure he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries a name , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have k@@ issed him . &quot;
the che@@ ek@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said Rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to secure their stop only &quot; because they will be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threatened to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only to the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he exercis@@ ed sympath@@ ies for the families of victims and gay , to tackle historical abuse in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like that this case will be solved immediately , so that in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he has an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations .
but the interpre@@ tations began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries are before a long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the early 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed to tackle this off@@ ence , but there are processes that need to pass through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke on June 5th in Jakarta with TIM@@ E , and said , he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which appe@@ aled the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been buried in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Vor@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims participated such claims with fier@@ ce unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , fear terri@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having buried the bodies , the military sought to me , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting works did not have stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police arrived on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the managers of a b@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old ra@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was d@@ row@@ ned when he was f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
the regulated vill@@ agers prot@@ ested front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers had acted on officers , which re@@ acted on it , dis@@ rup@@ ted haz@@ eln@@ uts .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the amount and killed one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we &apos;re afraid that it is ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who had been living in near the hospital and the witness was , as the injured , the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called , to withdraw the officers and move the mobile Brigade of the Police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the satisfaction of the family @-@ affiliated Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani , and Dam@@ al , who live in Pap@@ ua &apos;s green high@@ lands .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ ellen@@ ic Army , claims to defend the Pap@@ ua , exp@@ elling spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and demonstrations of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai , and arbit@@ r@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot;
some dive never again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tra@@ gic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is as well as range .
all people here are building what they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , which can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities has grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , which had come to Nab@@ ire &apos;s airport in greater number .
the few jobs , which there are in the region , usually come to the better educated and prosper@@ ity of migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to perform their own company more competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the leader of the family of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions of the reporting of international media are ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ cham@@ p were deported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to the movies .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign , to lift the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new d@@ angers for foreign journalists who try to report In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens in the most peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poor press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neigh@@ bors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pa@@ zi@@ es states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands , the United Nations Human Rights Council , to investigate the &quot; various and widely used injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r said journalist in Jakarta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so that it is difficult to waste the evidence of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people don &apos;t want to know more foreign governments to take knowledge .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura , on May 4 , visited their silence and sought him &quot; We want freedom , according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but also anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that she probably won &apos;t be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai treasures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai , the leader of the tribe of the tribe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , in poor aw@@ akening and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ People , like other Pap@@ ua , will consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they don &apos;t want righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and ass@@ ump@@ tions , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot @-@ victims led a recent symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the suffering of an ox was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they may know that you may not come true justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire Capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings to flee .
it is the second fire that was swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise building , which one is called accid@@ entally the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .
&quot; we slept and we slept at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people .
we burned the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50 . floor to bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; counted a inhabitants that was named as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dub@@ ais Civil Protection Auth@@ orities said that the units of the fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building with@@ drew .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for the person concerned .
the incident may be used for safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world , revi@@ ving .
an investigation undertaken by the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 showed that the largest proportion of damages from a covering , outer cover for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police , she said that the system of plates to isol@@ ate and covering at the London bor@@ der@@ ings tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spreading of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : continuing Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , for this sports revolutionary sugges@@ tion , Davis Cup has not only been able to play two @-@ third @-@ majority by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but also very well @-@ estimated five @-@ pack classics remain the traditional way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will continue to work on improving the application .
not only for the vote , after many contra@@ dictions , the proposal had come to advance to a neutral place .
new from 2018 will only be compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will soon have the host the first round in the next round .
to reduce the costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in training places , etc. and players will have to attend the Davis Cup less official media event .
more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ eller brings banned objects in the plane , finds out a survey
a survey among passengers managed to pass over 20 percent of deliber@@ ate or un@@ consci@@ ously forbidden objects on the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security administration , among them at least 6 per cent , which dep@@ ended the aircraft , while accid@@ entally prohibited knife or other items with blades .
they claimed less than 1 percent , they had already discovered that they traveled ir@@ regul@@ ate with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also fixed that younger trav@@ ellers do more mis@@ use the rules .
of the respon@@ d@@ ents , they said that they have tried to fly with anything that was forbidden by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common objects which were deliber@@ ately pre@@ lu@@ ded to T@@ SA agents were foods and fluids .
more than 3 percent reported to have borne items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ d@@ ents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ d@@ ents confirmed that they had deliber@@ ately forbidden drugs into the aircraft .
the company said that they asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accid@@ entally sm@@ ug@@ ly sm@@ ug@@ ged by the airport security , and how many did not have done it .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ ly sm@@ ug@@ ly - know@@ ingly or unkn@@ ow@@ ingly - by security , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that T@@ SA directives are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
humans are often uncer@@ tain , which liquids can bring them or how much of them .
thus , it is no surprise that the largest amount of banned items are prohibited from T@@ SA .
for a time the people thought the T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ ly ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers Cancel
electro @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ ass@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k like with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has under@@ lined that a part of the customer has with@@ drawn its un@@ warran@@ ted reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers on sales gains and more gig@@ antic target targets , Tesla CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time a second , less glorious number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had the past few months often with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition begins .
now Mus@@ k has a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 have already been with@@ drawn .
critics had always pointed out that this is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pay the $ 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; booking payment &quot; completely .
currently , 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations before , Mus@@ k was born in a telephone conference with analysts .
so far , the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders have to be fixed , however , the Tesla b@@ oss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year Tesla delivered 84@@ ,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is expected to put together all models - 500,000 be a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
if you order today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be ordered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 -@@ when Tesla creates it to drive his n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never in practice with maximum load inter@@ ruptions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , there is a greater del@@ ays , then the un@@ tie @-@ sensitivity could be used for Tesla &apos;s problem .
for then , the company may not hin@@ der any satisfied customers , in Sch@@ ed@@ d@@ av@@ on@@ es@@ elf .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt is moving back to the reduction of the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after having been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ induced air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities against re@@ ac@@ uation qu@@ icker than previous administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t mention the complaint against his previous position in a Federal Employment Agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a time limit of the deadline announced on 1 October in order to maintain the standards of ground o@@ zone by 2015 .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced that , in June that he will hes@@ it@@ ated compliance with a year to study his authority over time to study plan and to avoid community &quot; themselves in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent &apos;s strict environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ th@@ itt has repeatedly been able to block regul@@ arities , or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the su@@ dden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back to the P@@ ru@@ ten regulatory roll@@ back @-@ agenda .
last month , a Bundes@@ gericht@@ shof decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor me@@ thane &apos;s checks .
during a Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt &apos;s position resulted in o@@ zone standards just simply the will@@ ing@@ ness of EPA to collabor@@ ate with States through the complex process of tim@@ ely compliance with the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administ@@ rations , the EP@@ O has often maintained its dead@@ lines for performing and then maintained , maintained by activists and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who denied the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation due to jurisdiction , and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt suffered its &quot; power to delay and all others legally available , &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can Congress in its Congress on a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved in the last month of the bill to delay the implementation of the rules by at least eight years .
the Senate was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who had led the Coalition , who had lam@@ ented the EPA in this week , said the group int@@ end to maintain the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - to our bud@@ gets - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New York and over 115 million Americans that are affected by the Smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is troubled how much pressure does it need to bre@@ athe this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air that we in@@ hale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to fight against the ide@@ ological clo@@ ister of the tr@@ ump government to engage in environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church on the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock to a ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether its id@@ yl@@ lic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth benefit @-@ ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tum@@ our to their concerns .
Walter Martini states : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ i@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Wür@@ tt@@ uer@@ ttemberg ur@@ book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the present parish church on Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ t Eber@@ hard of Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , upon the Tum@@ linger mountain , besides the former parish church , a splendid farm , belonged to the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ worth , and not vice vers@@ a .
so there were people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , next to the sub@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still visible today in the town of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the romantic sett@@ lements of the village .
old maps of the period around the year 1600 sub@@ walls these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ worth was created from the early medieval owner church .
a Lord , who built a church , was buried with a past@@ or , and remained with a past@@ or , and was able to inherit this church .
thus , the right to insert a past@@ or , or propose a new past@@ or past@@ or .
three altars were in the church , and two bells in the tower .
the bigger of the two pieces at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created Glo@@ cke was first released in 16@@ 92 , but later was released during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the wind@@ breaks were cut and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was un@@ sealed .
in 1796 , French troops encamped in the vicinity of the church .
they broke the ch@@ anc@@ el and church chairs and used them as a fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to overthrow in 1809 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger &apos;s Hel@@ arius Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schw@@ eiler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche is broken .
only the bell tower left .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm fl@@ ushed the bell tower and half a storm .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still existing today was the witness of the 750 years old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berg and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ em maintain the &quot; Schaff@@ haus@@ er pen@@ ders &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant .
as an organizer , the friends and supporters charge tum@@ our on Sunday , July 16 , on the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .

Society wants to check permission of Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ ders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal prerequis@@ ite for the construction and therefore turned into the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been invited by Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is un@@ lawful .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of permission on 30 December 2016 , at the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time , only at the time limit to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power @-@ force zone exists .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , however , the concentration zone results in a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the municipal area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such zones shall prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days earlier , the town of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind @-@ gas concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette - but the Düsseldorf District government had not been approved , because of a form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of planning , the approval approval is un@@ lawful and therefore also to perc@@ eive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ ge , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the city council has decided again before the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette ; a permission of the district government stands out .
recognition : &quot; thus , the division of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance to the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter have been addressed since last week at the circle of quad@@ ru@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes you to check out the case once again .
however , they do not lead to that the procedure is stopped .
with a view to the administrative court , the circle wanted not to become subject to the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; on Thursday .
the NEW re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 metres high .
last year , the company was involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen participated in the town of Vier@@ sen , with the owner of approximately 65 hect@@ ars of large funds .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity supplies of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity demand of all quad@@ ru@@ e households .
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , four con@@ sen@@ sus t@@ own@@ houses gre@@ eted green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Aachen , Germany , as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg district Hein@@ sberg .

city and dealer plan &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ aries and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping in the city centre in September .
the Trade Association and the City Government want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to take the inhabitants of the shopping center into the city centre .

this is planned to market a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with its training places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite &quot; at night @-@ shopping . &quot;
the action is not only the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point to the weekend weekend , Christian König .
the municipal and commercial association co@@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .

this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; at Brun@@ nen@@ markt , selling Sunday , conversations with all commercial operations and hosts to move them to active participation .
the attractive offers on Saturday and the sale of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer re@@ pris@@ als are to be re@@ opened or re@@ opened .
these include courses and tourists .
but many loc@@ als would have lost the city centre at shopping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , everybody would like to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; downtown &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to revi@@ ve the city and stops all over the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it felt to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ ie network that partially multiplied , the king had said in spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , Head of the I@@ HK Center in M@@ ühl@@ hausen , told that on the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Thuring@@ ian cities are involved .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ sa , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade advertise and its importance for the common of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under responsibility of the I@@ HK and with many partners is also evident that every citizen with its decision will affect its direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump replaced after continuous tran@@ scription of telephone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to hear publicly that he would not pay for an planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. President ruled him because he had publicly traded on the wall in public . report , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with a promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the USA , and gay , Mexico for the project .

Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ sti@@ ff , who emigrated to Australia , who emigrated to Australia , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; and that the existence on trading , who would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would leave him , after having proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .

Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury launched a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ ink to the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man @-@ middle age in a needle @-@ strip @-@ suit - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside suspended the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the husband left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming , the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , only one night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if a sn@@ are about the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drove almost all of them in the audience very real sh@@ eu@@ f@@ zer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , the mayor of Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ col@@ m as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 were log@@ ged in 1946 .
no one was charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really unc@@ eas@@ able that , in all these years no one person was arrested , although we know , who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said to the organisation of reproduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gress@@ or of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizens .
a dramatic call for him serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that never has been wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosec@@ utions , we want the termination , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have received justice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to cure and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a place of jurisdiction lay a du@@ ck on the ly@@ ric@@ ant of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford &apos;s cas@@ ual on 27 July 1946 .
according to the FB@@ I files that were obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding lands have been suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain open for decades on foot , Citi@@ zens says that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Ac@@ tions in all the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court of Justice Court rendered its black citizens in Georgia for the first time in the summer of 1946 .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ akes according to the FB@@ I of the black colour guard Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett v@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly committed because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks told the rum@@ our of the town was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy , that she bore me from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from the prison so that FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and their cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she was away from prison , Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge drew near , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b around the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was Har@@ rison , prepared by Mor@@ de , which has been prepared and arranged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that includes a FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a con@@ spi@@ racy between the state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in mur@@ ders , evidence defects and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates there even more interesting .
&quot; it was a constitu@@ ent massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you register and vote , then you will pass this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene led the annual re@@ location of Moore Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de for almost a decade .
their presentation is vivi@@ dly , comprehen@@ sively and is justified in a form of deep rac@@ ism , so many believed that he doesn &apos;t exist in America .
it &apos;s difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we will be con@@ fron@@ ted with their hem@@ atology in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - in a room and lau@@ gh as Gre@@ ene had launched a well @-@ played overview over the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ens Co @-@ director .
he played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ o &apos;s role for years , but he &apos;s never said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story to life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett v@@ ester are playing , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , the H@@ ester sh@@ ou@@ d , and troubled him that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , disappeared from my own property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona wi@@ ches the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ noticed .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still a ch@@ ick@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just believe that white people have said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ nessed one of the other black perform@@ ers .
&quot; you just must meet the hard &apos;@@ R. &apos; .
and that &apos;s exactly there the energy in the room , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is engaged to get this properly , not only because of the game , but also because of memory to the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one lau@@ gh .
this repeti@@ tion ends non@@ violent and fast .
there are cry , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed up with a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and performs cheap holiday fun Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
your voice breaks at every second word .
a group of about hundred meters behind it is a group of about four dozen spectators swe@@ at and t@@ ears from the eyes .
the audience is almost even@@ ly divided between black and white .
one pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many will only come down the street .
you have lived in Geor@@ gi@@ as for almost eight hours , when Bro@@ oks carries on a pilgri@@ mage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de remained an An@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , feel the air h@@ aun@@ t@@ ingly .
when the last editions of the songs , Gre@@ ens invites the crowd closer to come closer and to inspect the bodies name .
children welcome to their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as he should remember it .
after a couple of minutes , Gre@@ ene of the amount - and suddenly there is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ gi@@ eil and wi@@ pe their t@@ ears .
in Brad@@ sh@@ aw , Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit who played the C@@ lan@@ tern .
Nick Ras@@ cona surro@@ unds two of his fellow players and then breaks up in their poor we@@ eping , the emotional burden of performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; a woman &apos;s whis@@ per@@ ing .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience continues with the actors for dinner together .
at a table pl@@ au@@ dert a white pair of Atlanta , excited about the reproduction with a black pair , which they &apos;ve just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought therefore to find words which the feeling left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they look like , as you look yourself , and those that look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what does it really do with me , that the Lyn@@ chen still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof close to his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said , he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring , because it describes the terror of what we have to bear , but it &apos;s also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so , if we want to learn it from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is sentenced to repeat . &quot;

great appl@@ ause , for the Fest@@ spiel@@ haus , is shown for the first time on stage - in view of the big heat again in legi@@ timate leisure clothes .
with excitement , the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Reg@@ ul@@ eam was expected .
in 2013 , he had to leave a score of the Pfei@@ f@@ concert in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the individual &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; -@@ Ru@@ ff went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way ahead of dp@@ a &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also was an understanding of what has grown .
I will draw a positive conclusion .
Max quantity works as volunteers
they work in their volunteers right at several places .
where everywhere ?
lot : normally in stone furt at the Furniture Market , once in the week I get here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I already worked in the open day @-@ day at the school .
how are your experiences yet ?
amount : there is a beautiful , broad spectrum which I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late professional volunteer .
how does it come ?
quantity : I made S@@ LC .
and then a construction of construction , let &apos;s say good@@ bye .
I &apos;ve known for me that it is wrong for me , and I will make something different to work with people .
and then I asked what you are doing .
make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps too , really is .
and was it so ?
lots : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social science during the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different fields of application during the volunteer ?
lots : yes , it is very variable .
it is probably coming up , where you can be the FS@@ J .
it can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly at the O@@ gs , so in the after@@ no@@ d@@ care .
for me it was exactly the right , what has happened .
I could recognize and see my own strengths , as it really runs .
different than in construction engineers ?
quantity : Na clear , here it is not possible to calculate st@@ atics .
one still has other people &apos;s head to have a completely different history behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been collected from the family - you always have to meet individually .
very interesting .
and you had no contact @-@ anxi@@ ous ?
lots : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a range that gives a lot .
much love , great kindness .
there is also a negative moments , but so life is that life .
P@@ ear@@ son cr@@ ashes further 3,000 jobs and cr@@ ashes the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British Education group P@@ ear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divide around 72 percent as a further restructuring program , since the company is con@@ fron@@ ted with the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the job reduction , the General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring that had already lost 4,000 points .
P@@ ear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction in May in a third cost reduction plan for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve the business by the fast step towards digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for fiscal year remains unchanged , after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of Nat@@ o and injured several other wounded .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter has been viol@@ ated , a statement of Nat@@ o shared with it .
according to the incident recorded in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , un@@ confirmed local reports were killed in three civilians .
the bombing is the last violent took Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ bed killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of Nat@@ o , it is called the explosion on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army attacked the impro@@ vised spr@@ inkl@@ ing rate . &quot;
the statement tells us that all the last in a stable state will be in the US military hospital at the Air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ d@@ ents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) is known for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian damage in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide coach of at least 30 people killed at a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ b@@ ment killed in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the fatal attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops joined forces in 2001 .
violence under@@ scores the pre@@ judi@@ ce security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump deliber@@ ates to support the number of US troops , military and police in the country .
correspon@@ d@@ ents say that the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul in the last weeks also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and particularly in the reputation of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns to de@@ cel@@ eration of the Smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ ating that states are obliged to interven@@ e the smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this was a day after 15 states endor@@ sed the agency for the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 , &quot; and said it will show the commitment to the agency , with States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and recall that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA @-@ b@@ oss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EP@@ O , which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , where entries must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year through October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the District of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ tire a wide range of environmental conditions , which is imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider Agenda , which should stim@@ ulate economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of Democrats and nature groups that worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health .
the EP@@ O &apos;s website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone has &quot; reduce the lung function and strengthen the respiratory symptoms &quot; such as as@@ thma .
congreg@@ ate wants joint room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ es conclu@@ des the establishment of a shared space in the future retirement home .
before discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing basic part was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it is still going to last until the Church of the Church is owned by the parish , but there is no planning entry for the project belonging to a private investor .
there is a discussion concerning a shared space .
one of the two investors still are in the boat , offered to meet the municipality .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters area available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the municipal council , such a common room is not available as the meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ less residence , but openly in the congregation .
for example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision , which was decided by providing funding for the current budget in the past autumn , has been decided by funding options .
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
the establishment of a shared space would be , so T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent increase of 30 percent .
the decision can be sign@@ alled to sign@@ alize the investor in this respect , no buttons between the legs and the laying down of the ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which reduces the height of the ground and the construction of economic power - was possible .
unnecessary , so not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : unanimously , he succe@@ eds the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
Daniela Call to the many own buildings with which you don &apos;t work right now , in order to re@@ ject to a shared space from the window , she says , &quot; I am doing so difficult . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks absolutely for the common room - however , absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it looks behind a covered sub@@ sid@@ y of contrac@@ tually or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface , you don &apos;t give supplements , but will receive a real , in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , to arrange the decision by decision , finds three advoc@@ ates .
so it stays together with two counter@@ parts at the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller , summar@@ ises : &quot; if we conclu@@ de the decision , we make a huge step forward to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

the last not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official season of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation .

in the resin of star to walk
in the Harz mountains the nationwide &quot; star path &quot; will be created .
this is the association constellation St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet track in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star @-@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the visitor &apos;s information needs , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connect nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to place along the planned route tables and inform about stars and star pictures .
during the first phase until 2018 the association plans &quot; well @-@ reaching installations to five to six places &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
information on the plates should be completed by the Internet .
therefore , at the site selection , a good mobile network reception is played .
also accessibility was a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star @-@ pf@@ ad train should be expanded by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge worth knowing , for example regarding the physics of the individual star , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , they learned to have different colors , or why a star stronger than another , although it is much more removed .
also , in which star constellation can be found a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association already operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest @-@ located ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal National Park , the National Park is part of the Federal Office for Nature Conservation on the six dark regions in Germany .
often from there the milk road and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible with naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt has been an initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen initiative since 2003 . it is similar to the planned star of the Planet@@ arium .
starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planet@@ en@@ weg leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the pillars with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink as a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 70 meters away .
the entire distance from the planet is just four kilometers .
while the light of Sun up to Plu@@ to is required for about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour up to St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are more qu@@ icker than the light in the cos@@ mos .
but the march towards the next fixed star would last another year .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed afterwards to fight the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;

four con@@ current to tire plat@@ ters
during an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira erup@@ ted at 16.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the end of the connector market , presum@@ ably after a ty@@ re @-@ fl@@ aked control over his vehicle .

the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the initial supply of the last through the rescue service , A7 towards the North for about one hour was closed , then traffic could be passed on to the left side of the accident .
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann has been hop@@ ing for the 2 : 2 at the season open@@ er in Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first part of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as they had not been the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two areas too much , and we must watch better fit in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge mountains , the three @-@ dimensional chain is also further optimised .
and a gate after a fre@@ ist@@ us want to un@@ subscribe even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( ensing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his personal trainer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we just have in the three @-@ positions on half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann player who can build well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequis@@ ite is , but that we are still better harmon@@ ize and we do not aff@@ ord so many play@@ errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak of a mis@@ sil@@ ently start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance might be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we go on Sunday with four points d@@ ast@@ es and let us concentrate on the cup , we will certainly talk about one ordinary season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wanted to know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season only after six to eight players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el did not want to speak of an advantage towards Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the players from Au@@ e could possibly even become a bit of fresh , as they had no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an asc@@ en@@ sion f@@ ooth@@ ills in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 per cent where they are at present &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the inner defence of Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guests are coming from the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at finally ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we carry them away , because we have the claim to come under the first Six , Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ zu &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat in Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which must be sm@@ ashed by pre @-@ enter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Qu@@ una &apos;s chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and super@@ charged . &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el wants to see his players on Sunday at no event .
new results of the Swedish asylum application evaluation tests published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( International Sett@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started with the implementation of the tests last year .
they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) for mistakes during the assessment of the correct age of some refugees was cri@@ tici@@ zed .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 880 sends to test@@ ant cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; possibly under the age of 18 . &quot;
the tests will only be conducted in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson at the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly resistant during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see big difference in statistics of last months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases , in which the person was evaluated as over 18 years , does not mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has suffered over his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases which we propose that the subject went 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ b@@ la@@ det the results published in 5@@ 81 , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , with X @-@ rays of wisdom @-@ teeth and MRI recordings of k@@ nee should be analyzed , which then cri@@ tici@@ zed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists .
a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the endo@@ kr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , whose work covers the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were so@@ oner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I think not that the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way , is very un@@ safe .
if we cannot tell it , we should not do so if we could say , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk , a child is un@@ right to judge , is low .
the biggest risk is in this case when the person is under 18 , in this case it is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in the Plan
work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are prog@@ ressing well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of gravity on the bridge was installed on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , builder in the department of road and traffic in the governmental branch of Freiburg .
in April the works began simultaneously in all three sanitary blocks between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is covered with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was constructed in 1900 .
as the other bridges also , she has come into the years now .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are thoroughly overhau@@ led .
the two other bridges lead through the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and were twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning at the northern side .
this is an edge fixing which is used as operating track .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian trail should then run .
the special thing is that it is finished by finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented Br@@ ück@@ ler caps .
special finger@@ tips has the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , which many companies can be connected .
the residents were informed about the work through hand@@ regist@@ ries over the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be canc@@ eled .
for the bridges between the building building and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by one amp@@ el .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher town entrance , the street is locked in the area of the bridge to the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;

AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
it is not so frequently used to draw parties to a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring to a hat .
the parties represented in the county of volcan@@ ei@@ fel ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) are part of a broad alliance , which shows the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell , for a large election campaign .
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , together with Alexander Gau@@ l , the leading duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already working hours before the start of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to AF@@ D developers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the slogan &quot; All on a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , ch@@ air@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the decisive organis@@ ers , really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people come here together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; written German potato salad , which could also eat the AF@@ D , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police clear@@ ed many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it show@@ cases presence mainly on the railway station , which is just a few metres from the ven@@ ues .
how did the AF@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario G@@ pes from the AF@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel reported that he ende@@ av@@ oured to make an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n for a cancellation there , but there was not enough parking place because of the already established Laur@@ enti@@ us kir@@ ch .
therefore , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes are pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
with a view to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says , &quot; This is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also does it : at 20 o &apos;clock , there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle , various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pe@@ eled AF@@ D ch@@ air@@ person Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 list@@ eners in the hall that maintain the top @-@ class did@@ acy for the German Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch their spe@@ ech@@ es .
unchanged , the police presence , but so far , the officials had a peaceful evening .
some more than one hour lasts the AF@@ D event , the guests at the subur@@ b have a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police may ab@@ back - no special incid@@ ents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of her life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stewart completely openly about their bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I gr@@ ats in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of the Hollywood star was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son who ultimately ensu@@ ed bit@@ terly .
despite all this , the Brün@@ ing Dar@@ stell@@ ations compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with every serious love which I have felt .
or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten announced that she was ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never been conf@@ used or ob@@ struc@@ ted .
I never liked it , not seriously taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time , like a bu@@ b , like a bu@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really viol@@ ated me .
when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a b@@ b .
I felt really attacked , fri@@ gh@@ tened and damaged .
well , I look back and remember : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public you don &apos;t like love to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you in a certain way , and it anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and perhaps they call me some , but I don &apos;t like to jus@@ tify myself from the whole public . &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you many prayers and much re@@ thinking ... today I &apos;ll tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t endor@@ se the democratic can@@ did@@ acy of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , according to Forbes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes is certain that he owns coal in five states , and have inher@@ ited a hydro@@ carbon store by his father .
he is worth € 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening issued an explanation on Thursday night : &quot; the Governor of Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party who would like to work more than to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 g@@ ou@@ gh@@ olds and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice had only been able to find a positive , united message &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said R@@ NC @-@ Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; hon@@ est &quot; Russian debt for d@@ oping sc@@ andal .
the global leader of the Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , comm@@ ended on Thursday , what he described as offensive exc@@ use from Russia to a D@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it &apos;s not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics head Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight against d@@ oping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said to him , &quot; All athletes , which were cut off at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining public b@@ oping in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) on state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very hon@@ est presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e told the Rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the whole congress have been pleased that Russian Federation has experienced a few hot times and everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , that Russia accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
the n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will start with the athle@@ tics World Championships which begin on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia still fulfill some of the criteria for a re @-@ attitude .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden trainer are still free , he said Rep@@ orters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .

the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security measures .
on the still un@@ explained inten@@ tional watch , Defence Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
they described the two revers@@ er pilots but as &quot; master of her specialist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are circum@@ cised in front of this highest victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Insp@@ ector of the German Armed Forces Volker Wie@@ ker .
in arms , ros@@ es laid down , the relatives of the arm rose up in the arm .
in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ el and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Defence Minister from the Le@@ yen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were decorated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief Operating Officer has built the flight operation of the fighting helicopter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with one of the first six educated tiger @-@ pilots of his Reg@@ iment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Reg@@ iment to which the soldiers , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would be conf@@ essed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dou@@ b@@ ts about the UN mission in Mali was not given by the Le@@ yen Minister : the deployment was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high significance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country which we separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral ceremony , the sho@@ ots were brought from the cathedral .
when and where they should be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr does not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
this gave the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard had already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it was in the announcement of the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be unc@@ le@@ ar .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a meal that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ illing ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to be king .
in 2016 he retired into retirement , and also places the title &quot; princ@@ esses . &quot;
then Hen@@ rik is not entitled to the title and the function , he didn &apos;t want to see himself as equivalent to his wife , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the director of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old finally will be unc@@ le@@ ar .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he enjoys the country that he has worked for the past 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had always imp@@ lied the sympath@@ y of the people with almost 50 years of age on the Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed himself over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did , cri@@ tici@@ zed .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citro@@ ën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoke instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and the call for this country , I could not hope the brand of social intellec@@ tu@@ als .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ash@@ amed .
that was two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants to real@@ ise new di@@ aling
the CDU and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
in Lower Saxony Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , Nieders@@ eil Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority , but he doesn &apos;t want to return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the resolution of the parliament , on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising release of a Green @-@ dep@@ u@@ ties from their coun@@ selling government in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the Government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the country code lost the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover therefore lost its succ@@ inc@@ t one @-@ votes majority within Parliament to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP .
the old Green Party El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained her on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU @-@ Group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ um@@ ler wants to recommend the Group to absor@@ b them .
this would have CDU and F@@ DP together with 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the ratio was inver@@ ted .
the new Parliament is elected as regular on January 14th next year .
Th@@ um@@ ler told that the red @-@ green state government must decide whether they could lead in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan W@@ eil does not stand for indispensable that the country day would rapidly conclu@@ de his self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction will probably decide to decide on further advance on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s day shall el@@ ect trust and el@@ ects a successor .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
these possibilities must be legally tested , &quot; said Th@@ um@@ ler .
&quot; you will discuss in peace , all questions when they are legally tested . &quot;
Th@@ um@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
they described as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the ab@@ sent members to return their country day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are , of course , that she has received her Land@@ tag@@ and@@ at which she has received over the Green Party , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the Land @-@ Chairman met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of Green An@@ ja PI@@ EL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we re@@ gre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it deliber@@ ately decided to adopt no pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also before the background , there was no behavi@@ our@@ able differences , we cannot im@@ itate this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD candidate for Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the polic@@ y@@ at Green @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ ire to the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green @-@ MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of v@@ oters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) to quickly select the Parliament .
the austr@@ itt T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political scientist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her pen@@ gu@@ el@@ ty and her Fr@@ ust their personal interests before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ Secretary &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Sal@@ vation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty in@@ flows and tries to beat political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU @-@ Group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ um@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to the CDU in the CDU .
the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the life@@ jack@@ ets before , with personal career , giving the outcome of the country code in 2013 .
the CDU was one of the strongest force in the SPD at that time , but SPD and Green had a very thin majority in the Parliament .
trade minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ vers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
an interview with German Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German Editor Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the st@@ amping pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states constitute the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though , after all , we currently know , for health haz@@ ards are practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the role of the states .
despite this , my house was immediately switched on and since the announcement of the victims of Germany in the narrow exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trading has the same as the manufacturers to worry about that the sold @-@ selling products are bu@@ st@@ able and health .
if with eggs of the resi@@ li@@ ent content of 0,00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not capable of transport .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the agriturismi to inno@@ cence .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the line knowledge , the production plants is not an immediate fault .
rather , they must pay for economic damages due to presum@@ ption of illegal practices of service companies .
as always there is too little control in the harvest .
is it missing only on the staff or in the conc@@ lusive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which have un@@ covered the operation .
however , the truth is also part of the fact that food fr@@ aud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent .
just therefore , a consistent En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of such events and hand@@ over to the State Bar in the cases , in which offen@@ ders may occur , of crucial importance .
I have already made several times already , that I &apos;m a consistent En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment by the responsible authorities .
is the regular al@@ m @-@ wing extremis@@ m in the food industry really necessary ?
consumer goods and consumers have the right to get safe and transport food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are righ@@ ted .
by the pressed means , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ zi@@ ds Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the post@@ ure of life @-@ animals is not acceptable , and must be immediately terminated .
it must be consistently applied to all levels and with high pressure .
I expect from all relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is quickly and completely resolved .
how to exp@@ ose the financing of the ball to Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moves to Paris
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules applied to prevent un@@ preced@@ ented issues of European soccer clubs will not distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched by the UEFA 2011 , means that PS@@ G must point out some@@ time that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moves to France .
PS@@ G can make money easy with security , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring it into an galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team through the rich @-@ rich family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but with legi@@ timate immigration sources , they must take their break @-@ even point in their own football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that societies who had taken huge liabilities on their stri@@ ving after success were effectively gri@@ eved and ris@@ ked , when banks or owners have returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P rel@@ ates to the debt of the clubs on the supervision of their losses .
the changes meant that the business model , the novel Ab@@ ram@@ o@@ vich was originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to build the team and to build a global brand - to a har@@ der matter .
the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P reduction period , which runs until 2018 , Clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini fell from the Presidency in the Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Alek@@ sander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to conclu@@ de by excessive expenses .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead , and we will surely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for FF@@ P , compared The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package dish , it can distribute the amount of the invoice for the duration of the contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the detach@@ ment will be issued for the next five years amounting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G combined with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the worst sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros , and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players otherwise .
the UEFA is based on the clubs that could try to over@@ see their financial perspective by organising their income by businesses that are connected to owners of a clubs .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ish company , PS@@ G may enable the value of sponsor@@ ing the standard market rates , the UEFA would not be considered legi@@ timate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the PSA by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar will be on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar would have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be simply to be found out of the UEFA Regulations authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA is more atten@@ tive to consider any attempt to move the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said , under the condition of An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ c@@ ot@@ ting purchases .
the association expects that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football player to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s trail by doing that PS@@ G would cause the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear event of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ o &apos;s official ownership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations from La League against a state who financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and has completely changed the total landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because one has different ways or different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new j@@ ogging supplier
in the past few years Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y @-@ chocolate has produced chocolate for the Swiss .
now it stands in collaboration with a possible end : the airline re@@ signs the order .
Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed the news agency S@@ DA on request of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ ern@@ z &quot; from Friday .
following the current plan , the airline will conclu@@ de a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
in around 17 million small white @-@ white packaged black@@ boards are distributed to 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the cost , the Swiss wanted to do no information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
industry experts estimate the order volume according to &quot; Nord@@ west@@ ward , &quot; from 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ rant @-@ daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : there is a prestigious order for a s@@ og@@ gi@@ er producer .
like many candidates , in the new invitation , the Swiss will not want to guess .
but in question only Swiss manufacturers come .
according to the newspaper article , Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to set up a renewal of the Treaty via the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for a comment .
ch@@ ocol@@ ates plates distri@@ butes the Swiss Life since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo , lead two years ago with the start of cooperation with Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate manufacturers .
on long @-@ hau@@ l destinations , the customers of the First Class are p@@ am@@ per@@ ed by the conf@@ ection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class S@@ izes passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y .

as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as it fran@@ chise , it feels close , the time would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; surprisingly well , not only because of its absur@@ d Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a talking c@@ anned vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .

blow against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police got a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday tomorrow , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konstan@@ z , Esslingen and Stuttgart have searched numerous objects like the public prosec@@ utor of Konstan@@ z .
at the age of 15 , 15 women were arrested for 25 years and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials ordered large amounts of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros safe .
during temporary ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will therefore be shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian Investig@@ ators were involved in action .
in total over 300 polic@@ emen were used .
the members of the Mafia is accused of drug crimin@@ ality , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and en@@ press@@ ors .
already in summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office is determined against the organized drug traffic@@ king in the South German space .
between the State Bar in Konstan@@ z and Palermo , there was an international exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the Grand deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday tomorrow .
the vis@@ or of the investigations went mainly to Italian m@@ af@@ ia with respect to Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
also a incident happened on 27 May in Hü@@ mm@@ ing , where several shots were fired at a restaurant in the morning , may go to the Ban@@ de account .
how compl@@ ain large g@@ aps in a fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lead to partially serious fail@@ ures in asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , is set out to be atten@@ tive to large g@@ aps in the country @-@ border register .
def@@ ici@@ encies in the previously registered data may lead to independent patches with asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; in an analysis conducted by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the regist@@ ers , ten million people with foreign nationality are collected , including 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administ@@ rated by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data were not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts have not been well maintained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become German citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer should be found in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data log@@ ging may considerably slow@@ down considerably , &quot; says the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on dis@@ advant@@ ageous people , EU citizens should be collected , which must not travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false assign@@ ments led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with trav@@ ellers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is therefore in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government began to send refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to return to Italy when they arrived from there .
the &quot; Neue Osn@@ ab@@ sent paper &quot; from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) . &quot;
in the paper , this means that BA@@ MF conduct such procedures &quot; regarding families with children , except for infants and infants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , such as the newspaper in reference to the difficult situation .
after the Dublin Convention , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach it first .
if a mig@@ rant continues to continue in a different EU country , this state can send him back to the eland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the grounds , writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have been submitted to the admission and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) provide these promises to be sufficient .
other EU countries would also return refugees in the context of the Dublin Convention .
the inter@@ religious speaker of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threatened because of the defects in the Italian asylum system of de@@ un@@ lawful reception conditions and a endanger@@ ment of the child @-@ safe . &quot;
second best result achieved

thus three persons could benefit from a blood don@@ ating .
at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported from the actions taken in spring in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates with 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the inflation of inflation have caused spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remain , when she maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers of the Bank ( M@@ PC ) voted on account of 6 to 2 , with interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with a slight increase of interest rates , as the weak economic growth has had the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 % and in 2018 , that the pressure would continue to grow to 1.6 % , and inflation in autumn is expected to rise to almost 3 % .
but they show that in the coming years , interest income would be necessary to push down the inflation of inflation , and said that the credit costs would have to climb more than expected to the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth Economic Party , which was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
in order to provide time for the financing plan , in order to provide cheaper finance for banks starting from the coming February , that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds worth more in the frame of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central predic@@ tion of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real @-@ time households will continue to consumption . &quot;
in addition , she repeated that &quot; a certain road of monetary policy &quot; would require a slightly larger displacement of inflation , and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent , than the markets await .
the markets currently projected the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank emphasi@@ zed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decre@@ ases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank for this and next year corrected the Bank for this and next year , in comparison to the 1.9 % and 1,7 % in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound dropped to these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth will have increased expectations on a interest rate and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly heated to the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by increasing inflation and minor sever@@ ity , since the dis@@ appearance is worse , before it will be improved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year ro@@ gn@@ ose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will recover significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated for a part of lower consumer spending .
a year after lo@@ wering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU @-@ voting that caused the sin@@ king of the ground .
the Bank estimates that it will probably last four years , until this will achieve the prices and the economy .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank on the interest rates , the call has increased after a interest rate , since inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ dist@@ ressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July had demanded an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation was reduced from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected to attract it in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceeding the ratio of 2 % would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to as@@ sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ality Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shorter return of s@@ wap rate this mort@@ gage market would be more competitive , as the len@@ ders would like to qu@@ it very quickly and finish the year in a positive way .
the market looks especially good for those who close the existing deal and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with extra @-@ free options and low inst@@ al@@ ments are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) shall yield 10,000 people to the controversial HIV drug .
from September after a fight against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS , patients will receive access to an &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV pre@@ treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ positioning control rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis , which may reduce the risk of risk for high risk reduction by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a judgement of the Supreme Court , the N@@ HS granted authority to pay him despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
the chess suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) signed this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first belong to people who will follow people and other clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ emp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV @-@ preparations to be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pre@@ p is significantly reduced the HIV transmission in infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication can be found in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or even two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come in question , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons suffering from HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , which agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a physician can also register for possible participation in their local sexu@@ al@@ clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medication in this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study should assess the full potential by pre@@ p , collected and implemented in a large scale , as it is implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and over@@ take . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in the management of one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive with NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pre@@ p , when it is targeted specifically to needy , vulner@@ able people , provides the opportunity to alter the English HIV @-@ epi@@ demic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt to develop this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be done quickly throughout the country and that no one has left the risk of HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now since the Pre@@ p test medicine has been described , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Hodg@@ son , Shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pre@@ p process will welcome and over@@ due to months delay and delay .
the evidence demonstrate how transform this drug to be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt gives us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is done quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the termination of HIV in society an step closer . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and smart designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former band of bonds with a passion for real estate , will be reduced from a large house to Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne @-@ terrace - and it &apos;s a demonstration of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not un@@ packed and sold their bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I love myself in love and made an offer for this day . &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom @-@ estate with a sealed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne storage room and an mezzanine to take advantage of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , great windows , lots of light .
this was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home , not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms each other , so that the architectural challenge thereof existed in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan was forced to think to dis@@ solve the pre@@ judi@@ ce .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the spaces so that they were stack@@ ed on each other , without changing ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not only have to build a simple platform , but the steel suggests that it had the right height at the top or below . &quot;
this arrangement has enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine is a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lights put the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theater , space and light .
on both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to allow him longer .
the kitchen feels like a window in another room in the kitchen .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units space for all the bri@@ cks and glasses of the jo@@ g .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
hing@@ ed kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important , so that if you slide the door , very light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agent will occur and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here they managed to increase the floor space and add high @-@ quality materials , adding the room to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional binding in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electric sockets in the walls .
they are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed through a good design and increased square met@@ ry of somewhat standard to something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you wouldn &apos;t decide to leave this .
brothers fighting for a $ 500 million US $
two brothers has four decades after their Italian family established the dy@@ n@@ asty , in a meditation because of one of the largest real estate in Vict@@ ori@@ as , worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how its ownership and its business capacity is to be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family @-@ operation since 2014 , but a sharp dispute concerning the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers has accumulated 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co family founded the family and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Colin - von Paul is described as &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thir@@ ds of the company &apos;s capacity and Paul is approximately one third .
a place of jurisdiction indicate that Colin is owned by $ 316 million and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proven to Paul as a pro@@ bl@@ ation point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Colin proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we left him with the left what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed sett@@ lements , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - including Colin , as Paul claimed to have it excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but raises Paul in front of managing some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , Colin was filed by Colin , he says he was hop@@ ing to sett@@ le the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes , that the family has the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs will rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and held by both sides .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and del@@ ic@@ at@@ ess@@ ary stores from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early 70s .
to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood song , you used the Coll@@ ing@@ wood song in Colin the first je@@ ans of the family .
Colin says that he began in West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that her and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me , that he never wanted to jus@@ tify the brothers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of the De Lu@@ tis group , but Colin claims that Mark has paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept very back , though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media received with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very , very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to lay down my family name , and he wrote to our family names . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have thought that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he still on a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ umps of new Chief of Staff is planning to restri@@ ct media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports from news media - in hope to keep the b@@ oss on a uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , in his first working day with leading employees , he set a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wants to repair : bad information that are in the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said the employees that you should flow on paper or in correspondence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the president would make better decisions if he would like good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by controlling his media advis@@ es .
President Tr@@ umps regarding television runs decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Candi@@ date has failed because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former elect@@ oral advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it is under control , according to six former election campaign civil servants , to ensure that its personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ dic@@ ulous .
maybe these campaign officials know something , what we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ umps Twe@@ et would have any more ignition .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , the tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees manage it already several times , practic@@ ing him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevent it , that tr@@ ump contro@@ versi@@ es are caused .
a part of the problem is that people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material , which may promote their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - something busy with this history - reported in May on the pre@@ ference of consultants , du@@ bi@@ ous President of strategic reasons .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former t@@ ach@@ uting officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he has sti@@ ff@@ ened to it , where these origin@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody accused the president of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ oc@@ ateur , Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson had been banned from Twitter , or that he had not offered a concrete evidence , or that he ex@@ presses false acc@@ us@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask people to ask about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper tray . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tried to do three months later , the same .
perhaps he will prove itself as Pri@@ eb@@ us as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still looking for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make cell@@ ars mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ sought cr@@ ush@@ ers get Post of Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is praying and raised .
the police in all of Europe send postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on the run .
since the ad@@ resses of the requested sword @-@ crimin@@ als are not known , however , references from the population are hop@@ ing and praying .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; -@@ Advent calendar from winter .
the experiences had shown that many volati@@ le and holiday destinations , it was called Europ@@ ol .
you have 21 postcards covering all searched cr@@ ush@@ ers in 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times the website has been viewed .
36 of the online @-@ con@@ fes@@ sions could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them following the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers are negoti@@ ating on a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est household owner of the West Mid@@ lands have once again been negoti@@ ated with some disc@@ arded trav@@ ellers who are drawn from the commune of drawn gr@@ aben to request a field in front of their houses .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on one field outside a we@@ al@@ thy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire @-@ Series . &quot;
they have horses , babies and an army of transporting goods , after they were rejected only in May , without bur@@ sed by the Council of excav@@ ated atro@@ cities to prevent its accidents .
the tac@@ tile group found a gap in defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted to find a way .
the inhabitants responded to the Council of Soli@@ hull , said that it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went to there on Monday evening after having passed by Bentley Heath where they were thrown onto the pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement the problem , because he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trav@@ ellers were moved in May there , and they returned again .
more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to go by taking long instruction to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live in the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay to pay my communal service , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
an inhabit@@ ant that didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; It is ri@@ dic@@ ulous , we just saw the last round of this trav@@ eller , just to be pill@@ aged by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
a speaker of the Council of Soli@@ hull : &quot; we are aware of a in@@ fu@@ eled camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ m@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible .
in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as possible many people have an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior at the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we place our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on March 1 next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambience of the hotels Bir@@ k@@ enhof during the 13th of April 2014 , it was lost approximately 30 000 nights per year and also revenue through the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , a dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who had been offered in the district , the hotel buildings were offered as collective accommodation , providing controversial discussions .
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by the preparation of a building plan to secure the area as hotel premises .
the decision was not inev@@ itable at that time .
but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospects in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels , Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer acquired with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again be a home in the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , there have been a long time building container in front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , extensive renovation work will be made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to part are disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms are removed .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are furnished with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is converted , new windows are installed .
everything should be &quot; nicely bourgeois &quot; as well as Thomas Sch@@ erer is ex@@ pressing .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
it doesn &apos;t want to move at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already emphasi@@ zed at a higher city centre , emphas@@ ises sh@@ ears .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms can be set up wide , clari@@ fied further .
both individual holiday , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourist director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so sh@@ red@@ der .
the city &apos;s ideas are the same with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
following the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to set itself exactly .
sc@@ arc@@ ely amongst a million Euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outer lines are also applied to the front , which is already visible clearly .
in a courtyard , a large terrace that is open from the restaurant which is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Representative to the Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ air by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller shall have a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel has taken up work over the past few weeks , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on appeal with the cause . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the Sender CN@@ N reported that the first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps are the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin from a longer term to have targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there was a question between Tr@@ umps elect@@ oral experts and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as an advisor of the Republi@@ can .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also reported more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment under micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ cian Tr@@ ump was personally covered in the center and negoti@@ ating the pre@@ ference , whether the president possibly imp@@ aired the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ies is to check out this evidence in possible ro@@ scope cases and to decide whether the charge will be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called anch@@ or@@ age .
mostly they are switched on , if it is about larger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Committee may also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to re@@ charge people to the hearing of o@@ ath .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , inv@@ itations were issued , which rot@@ ate the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
you should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps advis@@ ers and law @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his time Chief Executive Officer Paul Man@@ a@@ fort he participated in conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday night in US television that it will show that Mu@@ eller shall not be sh@@ y in his work , and that if it should be necessary to act quickly .
but it is not inev@@ it@@ ably promised that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nonetheless the en@@ forcement of the beginning of a new phase in the examinations and a new reason for president Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , President of the Thursday night used a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they don &apos;t have anything else to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he doesn &apos;t know nothing from the implementation of a Grand Jury .
however , these work usually work to ger@@ minate and st@@ ressing .
the White House advoc@@ ate all measures which accelerated the work of the collector in &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FB@@ I head James Com@@ ey had said three times , that won &apos;t be determined against the pre@@ sidents .
I have no reason to accept that , in the explanation it was changed .
but Mu@@ eller was first used , after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this r@@ ush were acc@@ us@@ ations against dr@@ unk@@ ards , whom they want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under large print because of the examination .
according to the representation of US @-@ media , the White House collected material against the collector and its employees .
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about it , if Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
other than an independent member of the Congress like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air about the later re@@ represented President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has led a position in which he could gre@@ eted theore@@ tically on ur@@ ging the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several transmitters of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic Sen@@ ators presented their offspring on Thursday , after which the special medi@@ ator could not be dismissed .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gig@@ antic iron berg has been replaced by the mere seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the castle .
this was part@@ ed by the cer@@ o @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
over one trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large colonies is now north and will probably be two , three years , until he was mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice giant , researchers have registered in the past three decades .
no risk for mankind is not coming from him .
to what extent of climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ice@@ berg , is un@@ clear .
however , there have been a series of unusual mer@@ gers in the region for around 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a factor of a factor .
in the opinion of many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
now , the broken Kol@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ow .
Sh@@ el@@ ow &apos;s swimming on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is therefore always growing in the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ow is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula .
North of this sh@@ el@@ fe@@ at was the balance of w@@ axes and break down some years ago .
a complete shot pe@@ eling is broken there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ow is in danger ; for the front edge I never dropped so far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate can be broken under voltage and can be broken down to a piece .
the m@@ elt of Sh@@ el@@ m@@ elt and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swi@@ m on the water and swi@@ ft as much water as it yields the m@@ elt .
however , the loss of the s@@ ni@@ b leads that gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , however only in a small size , writes the British research project on the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ow is the fourth largest shot in Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres .
it regularly breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural rock and no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield comes in a endanger@@ ed position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists may be controversial if the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ow again will go back or long @-@ term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gig@@ antic iron don &apos;t lead to climate change , so in recent decades , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula have cr@@ ushed into the past decades .
this long finish of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ic@@ onic area of Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula have dropped by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula have been war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years , thereby nar@@ row@@ ed in the areas where the temperature is at the fastest .
CDU wants to join the staff at the staff
because it is more difficult to occup@@ y @-@ free jobs , the CDU , out of the employer @-@ association to be more attractive .
just before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has made 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 appren@@ tices have left their first working day .
the ap@@ points at the circle are obviously very desired .
around 620 applications were recorded for this year to be recorded in vain places .
nonetheless , the circuit still lack personnel to tackle the increased requirements and tasks .
at present , there are currently 50 not occupied places in the district M@@ ett@@ mann .
for example , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CDU would now have to sei@@ ze the initiative together with F@@ DP and U@@ WG &apos;s initiative and opposite the expert angel in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management shall be working according to the wishes of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept for recru@@ itment and personal development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the objective is to cover not only short @-@ term constra@@ ints , but future @-@ oriented candidate short@@ age , is called it .
the overall concept should focus on inside and outside , showing concrete measures for trans@@ verse beginners and include an educational campaign , demand CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
it sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has to do with personal problems which you knew not earlier .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and provide attractive , more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a regular &quot; contest of public employer . &quot;
for this , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ condition@@ ers come from the service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest time for action , so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , president of the CDU , goes beyond his party with his party .
he took care of un@@ long already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ aust@@ thick surprise when he publicly presented the staff of staff and b@@ loss@@ oms the remaining parties .
people would like to check all the possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the municipal workers &quot; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not short @-@ term in short @-@ term solution , the gy@@ ro@@ scope with the trade unions should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a door@@ step &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the CDU , employees and officials stri@@ ves to pay better than the tariff for public service is actually fore@@ seen .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , enh@@ ancements , or more money , if one changes to a higher level , based on vocational years .
but the tasks of the circle have increasingly grown more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established , where employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ ler Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy shar@@ pen@@ ed the sound to NGO refugee rescue
Italy has war@@ ned NGOs that keep rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they don &apos;t continue to keep up new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said interior minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; because whose team had worked effectively with human traffic@@ kers , which facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation only since one year , refused to express himself as detailed proposals of the Italian citizen of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ o@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can prove all charges that are collected currently , after having collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had monitored the ship of &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is believed that his crew can be supplied by ding@@ h@@ y migrants who can drive them directly from traffic@@ kers , so that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again .
at least one such meetings took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosecutor , the contents of Italian media was published .
the occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which prevents rescue operations in zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other mo@@ tives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officers , who supervised their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that participated in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily but acceptable , since they don &apos;t have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refused to sign himself , the Nobel prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors Without Fron@@ ti@@ ers ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said now that the number of migrants came to Italy in the last weeks , that the efforts to strengthen Libyan dis@@ gu@@ ards and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tun@@ nels , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;

nine W@@ eil@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berlin Foreign Post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in Nord@@ pf@@ al@@ z , in order to enjoy more than four days of Tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ enh@@ eimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the Vin@@ eyards to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there were look@@ out points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the pe@@ eling forest and the pre @-@ bearing levels .
between there were repeatedly longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ c@@ als .
on the second day , it went to Sal@@ ine Bad D@@ k@@ heim and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again the look@@ out spot is connected to the view@@ point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
in the last two days a lot of altitude were cancelled .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ versions brought will@@ ingly p@@ auses .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers at the open air inc@@ iner@@ ate br@@ at@@ br@@ ine .
Neustadt was also controlled .
after 173 km and almost 4500 meters , the group had to know the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and c@@ ultur@@ ally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps e @-@ sport
are the Sport @-@ Stars now sit down before computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating with wind and weather to battle on the stadium ?
fact : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious industry , become a more lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages .
these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ ton which increasingly engage in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to insp@@ ire new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board of Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup organized the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ ers will compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
Robin D@@ ut@@ t also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must meet in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people still go into the stadium &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract you could be online far more often present in these markets than once per year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
during the E @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the Soccer @-@ Simulation FIFA on competitive level .
long as long as in normal sport , Li@@ gen is established , in which professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the performance is safe ordinary .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ous has dealt long with the question .
for professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , E @-@ sport is a sport because he is Com@@ peti@@ tiv , and many biological and physical reactions , which can be found in classic sports - for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
there are also co@@ gni@@ tive abilities , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick re@@ activity .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercising their body and keep on nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
fung@@ us also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a subject . &quot;
insp@@ ections are difficult to run by online games , and in the scene failed the structures of classical sports .
scientists emphas@@ ises the high @-@ inclusive effect of E @-@ Sports .
players are international on the way , this is like a major global family , there is no intercultural inhib@@ itions .
a study of business consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts an rapid growth .
in 2016 , Germany has been implemented 50 million euros , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years the turnover is to be 130 million .
indeed , against the barely 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports like hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International are many countries already further .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sh@@ aqu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez at the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports are involved .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher invests in the e@@ Sports @-@ Wet@@ t@@ provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot is also doing in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ sport had been introduced as a class , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
according to D@@ ut@@ t , the Netherlands and France are obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department in the Netherlands and France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ f@@ B executive board declared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in no@@ stal@@ gia are fallen , and the old times are to clari@@ fy , this is not enough anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s go to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company was able to set up the company on the modern market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ ut@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t hold it that only in football everything remains , as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy was sentenced to suicide ,
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind guitar@@ ists and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced to death in June because of a neg@@ lig@@ ent killing of Conrad Roy , who took the life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is absolutely good .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
it was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives were argu@@ ed that both her and Mr Roy had suffered a psychological disease .
in red tro@@ users and cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter was clothed with t@@ ears in the eyes , folded up hands and down@@ ward eyes , when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have changed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judgment of the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they finished his life to make their own better .
she has not adopted any responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has no re@@ gre@@ t . &quot;
but car@@ ters said , it was a &quot; terri@@ fic circum@@ stance , which they completely re@@ gre@@ t . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their spiritual disease did a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who had said that there was no day in which I would not smoke to the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to be proud of me and , as I go with all my pain , which we will bear for et@@ ernity with us , for his sisters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be persec@@ uted by the knowledge &quot; will never take part in the wedding of her brother or become a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the only person to have been together with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime , to try another , suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy had been killed by a hydro@@ oxide tox@@ ic@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case with@@ drew national attention after car@@ ters text releases related to him that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go on , spring from a building , I know yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent to his family in the two weeks before his death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you must do to power the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter won attention through Roy &apos;s death and ordered them to benefit from the case due to some press .
the case has split the legal opinion .
among the few who def@@ ending the Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , was condemned in 2007 for murder of their British roommate in Italy before it was acqu@@ itted for two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , released in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ves compassion , and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed to start at the Audi Cup as captain , isn &apos;t a co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation will not harm you .
something happened to his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the additional garment was very small , very small .
but since far and wide at the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m was not on the second day , he made his own st@@ amped Bin@@ d content to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the stance could have been better run as at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the mi@@ racle of the coach could also interpre@@ t too .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a guide for young designers , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday welcome professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f .
sugar is distributed to those who wish to give a lot to them that you want to keep at the mood .
who is so chosen , the heritage of Lah@@ m is allowed to use a small extra motivation only well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ushed on the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
right back , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did the rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich is working on this initial information such as the one who can take the rest in the hand .
he gave instructions to len@@ ose the un@@ washed tro@@ upe .
he had a glance for all , while many others were busy themselves .
Vi@@ dal so that to play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ks hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches went down to the achievements of the Asia @-@ Travel ( fol@@ ds only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Nik@@ las Sü@@ le did not exp@@ ire to their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ kot .
this did not work well .
beside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y ran before the defense , both ag@@ ged confi@@ d@@ ently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm did very difficult , but also sw@@ elling me a few times in play @-@ up .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave us that the result was &quot; not so , as we have hop@@ ing for that . &quot;
but he showed an ordinary performance in debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; play@@ location , speed change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style , I was also brought up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual , this Bayern @-@ World is still available for the re @-@ processes , one saw the game in connection to the game .
Rud@@ y was not an example in the Kat@@ ak@@ om@@ bs , or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich said after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements on his new fellow @-@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there he heard of Sü@@ le a interesting sentence : &quot; what &apos;s going on here , now I have already noted .
with Bavaria you have to win every game . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pe@@ eled Minister : Economy lo@@ aves Wis@@ s@@ ings Tempo
it is often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , nor Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year , in which the new business Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ inquiry by a change in economic policy and t@@ ad@@ ors at the same time the old minist@@ ries .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing is the wishes of the economy to blo@@ t Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt . &quot;
the biggest turn of the turn is Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the decline of highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is at the priority list of the country now at the top .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is supposed to be the building right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the country &apos;s plans of the country also plays the West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ um@@ ung Trier &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is in the fore@@ most urg@@ ent needs of the Federal Transport Schedule . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to take the route in operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us provides a sign@@ post to support regional , but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) is aim@@ ing to increase by Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate Label , to increase the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing pra@@ ises an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , pra@@ ises the I@@ HK .

a premium of 1000 euros is planned for the constitu@@ ent master test and 2500 Euros if graduates are self @-@ employed in the Meister@@ schule within ten years .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , there are very fast facts , be@@ ating the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce , Trier .
to date , 56 new engineers , who wants to anticip@@ ate the regional operation of mobility , are occupied only at 29 places .
the I@@ HK advis@@ es to forgive more orders on external offices .
the CDU @-@ Group spokes@@ man Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Au@@ d@@ itors , the country invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and more than 20 million euros in the receipt of provincial roads .
in addition , Frank Nat@@ us is still expecting a concept of the country , as it wants to resolve the expert creation in the region .
the current broadband construction in the country would also be not@@ orious .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the score 3.4 .

Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ chairman , the company is the opinion that &quot; there is more intelligent options as a road constra@@ ints , &quot; and thereby moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to prohib@@ it or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles .
at Tuesday , Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
the company described the companies as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly funded the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen ox@@ ides to em@@ it diesel engines are em@@ itted as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and may cause as@@ thma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems to install neutr@@ alisation from diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases , also make it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also accused of ign@@ ore the powerful car companies and signs the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called de@@ generation devices that was tested by car if a car has been tested but for normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be submitted in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi has been involved in German Criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities have accused of being installed a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry that focused on the United States , was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could load Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer contributes proportional to the winning of Volkswagen by Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ n@@ oses and the laughter against the sor@@ row
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most published Cart@@ oon @-@ drawing , the buttons of his figures are its hall@@ mark .
in addition to 85 , the Argent@@ inian still holds and works in a film .
his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he himself struck among other things as a character for lucky cards - what makes it fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after St@@ ations in Lima , New York and Paris worked at the end of the 60 &apos;s . the breakthrough : with the publication of his Cart@@ o@@ ons in Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other major magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
and again , the artists were inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo pupp@@ ets w@@ ells in drawings with the shot tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he puts his own information today on the drawing area , working daily for nearly ten hours .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and small , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favorites and clo@@ cks are still plenty of spread worldwide .
he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures for six years .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a Giraffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los and most popular animal in his drawings - that has an thous@@ and@@ roid in his opponent .
for the first time , his characters speak in the 3D movie , which should come to the cinema screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
therefore , it works rather on the TV series that is produced , like its original drawings , which is password produced .
Lav@@ ender from Provence threat@@ ens climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the Lav@@ ande is moving forward to d@@ rought remin@@ ding conditions and ill@@ nesses of disease @-@ borne insects such as scientists and farmers , trying to find solutions to find great head@@ aches .
Eric Ch@@ a@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institution CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence was effectively endanger@@ ed because the plant has been suspended over the past few years , which has much less rain in spring and in autumn much more .
this has impact on the li@@ fes@@ pan of Lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ik@@ ade , a mic@@ rob@@ ac@@ ter@@ ium , the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ aden transfers , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil not just looked for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very important for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Ch@@ a@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or failed .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties , which are more resistant to dry .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually come on Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ stopp@@ able drugs .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what saf@@ er : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were the goal of an attack with Gran@@ ds , or leave them at home in 2009 .
safety experts have three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , ally , ally .
they ask the re@@ porter , to suggest the name for every column - no evidence is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and stomach .
there are drugs , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartridge , a catalogue of crime that make chaos of Mexico .
there are no quiet break of violence , and throughout the country , there are more journalists there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 have been standing in attacks and threats under federal guard and by now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter , their publishers and her In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez , Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez , wrote in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his lack is deeply perceived , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; by Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear T @-@ shirts , that show the sm@@ iling face with glasses or its typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their divided themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special edition of the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 , it was initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traffic@@ king and organizational crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rare from court .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are ir@@ on@@ ically , and although the terrain is still tra@@ gic now .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without Justice , the meeting has little benefits to the discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stup@@ id to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we don &apos;t miss it all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the Newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men , and was shot at him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which was translated with &quot; 12th River . &quot;
the shooter went away in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing than silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition in the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the most bloo@@ dy batt@@ lefield of the country , as riv@@ eting frac@@ tions started to fill the vacuum .
it turns nothing to be shot in Sin@@ al@@ oa every day or several people on the road , or that the cemetery is full of galvanized , two @-@ storey Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug may be bigger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a chair is the control of coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , is broken with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
in February , in February , the publication of a interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alizing cart@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may denied the sons , the v@@ oter turn@@ out bought each copy of the issue as soon as they delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second error occurred in the Val@@ dez , nor force Val@@ dez , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country to his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survi@@ ves that his friends and colleagues draw up that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , joined the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without anno@@ ying the space @-@ po@@ ison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time , the newspaper used a reputation for cour@@ ageous and hon@@ orable reporting , and sales and advertising .
re@@ por@@ ters loved it to publish hard tre@@ ad investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories , nobody else had to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce it received the prestigious &quot; Mary @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ ing the Mexican drug history .
he gave voluntarily to that he had afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to live more &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J @-@ Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug traffic@@ king in Sin@@ al@@ oa is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October .
&quot; you must take over the task that falls as a journalist - either the or you play the Dum@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ vo@@ gel , which could curse the friend , the friend , the gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and stro@@ kes , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he always would go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar , opposite the office and sit there at the same table .
then ask them : was his love for the routine ?
his death also has forced them to ask their own ass@@ ump@@ tions , how they can do their work on the best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and run@@ ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ licensing and self @-@ maintenance .
trust its own inst@@ inc@@ t .
if it is wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a sense that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell a sense ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then the matter of Javier happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ al@@ oa not more - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ r@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce to security training suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days earlier , spy@@ ware that is exclusively sold to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , there are two polic@@ emen protection against the heat from 104 ° C ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the regional government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an district of central Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the jo@@ king , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who were not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drugs are fac@@ to under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has led out three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former renowned box@@ er Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Ch@@ av@@ ez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the State spending , focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about it , who was kidn@@ apped , or how it happened , so was caution that everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite local drug dealers and authorities .
re@@ por@@ ters from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a Poli@@ ti@@ cian , which heard the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , who ruled the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incid@@ ents in this locomotive , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; went into a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers wanted to describe the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage compartment for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees had become something that they had never expected : activists in the press @-@ name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez lam@@ inated a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning after a further journalist for the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western part Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and civil servants say that it is based on DNA tests .
throughout the country , journalists became loud , by organizing themselves in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on enclos@@ ures and buil@@ ders .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was gone into Washington and tries to collect international support for judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to send out journalists and said they have said the truth .
it has since then asked that she is as@@ sured by the government , because she wor@@ ried that their rage has injured their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had said repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crime , involved in government officials and an equ@@ itable company . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that Rep@@ orter could not only be killed by drugs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces working with organised crime against a ceiling .
last year the media group &quot; Artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; published more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , you think you would like to disp@@ rop@@ or@@ ate the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously Mor@@ de have a terrible effect .
nobody for@@ e@@ eth the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was report@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kartell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are adjacent to their separate head .
some branches have chosen some branches , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ d@@ ents MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as it did El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its directors in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the page with an inscription on the page &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists are escaped from their home countries or even from the country .
it &apos;s a pain@@ ful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they always watch the streets and look for haz@@ ards .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , like the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who wanted to be a poet , gives the drug traffic@@ king his drug traffic@@ king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sitting in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began .
a series of sl@@ ot@@ ings with band ri@@ vals and security forces near the bathing place Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues , as it was promised by a series of Kartell @-@ emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the Bord@@ st@@ ow Canal , you have published the news on the Ri@@ odo@@ ce &apos;s website via mobile phone .
the introduction had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ enen he@@ ats near to - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who held the guard to see if they were read@@ iness .
if they fear fear , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the massive portrait of the folded founder of the newspaper , whose mid @-@ finger was visible to the whole Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when on the same day that Javier was murdered , practic@@ ing me on the road to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send me on the road &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to increase his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , even though a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
now , researchers found that the first findings of the unbelievable Nash@@ or@@ ns have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even determine that his p@@ aired skin of red@@ dish Braun was - and they said , she had had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; held Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well balanced condition , researchers , who inspired it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ oured plant stress is best preserved in its kind .
it was found by Sh@@ awn Funk , when he was at S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine close to Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , in the 21st of March 2011 .
he met something that appeared on the surrounding rock in Plat@@ l at the plat@@ eau , and decided to look more precise .
F@@ ossil was discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within 2.500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all of these hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re only a little with eyes blin@@ king , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said head of Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the science story as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant stress is covered , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , and res@@ embles a shi@@ fting tank , probably threatened by carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage in order to hide from space and used a sh@@ ielding technology which is known as counter@@ parts , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to so@@ ak his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now able to see at Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and studied at Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta brand@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineers Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours , it has been carefully to cover it .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the con@@ voy , a widespread defence method in animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker was less than its under@@ side .
although the conv@@ ocation is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far from far the animals live today .
it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs has had enough pressure due to the carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . the evolution is favorable to the con@@ frontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter@@ sh@@ ady approach - think of Reh@@ e , Zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous than prey , what &apos;s sign@@ alling that this no@@ dos@@ sier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong Rau@@ b@@ tier conduct on a massive , highly woven Din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous to have been the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ wers of the chal@@ k period &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the Din@@ osau@@ rs was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life , including his con@@ served , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that din@@ osau@@ rs died when he died , was driven into a river and driven into the sea , where he sank into the sea .
at that time Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ sier is really remarkable because it remains completely covered with preser@@ ving skin , but has also been preserved in three dimensions and the original form of animal teach , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost equally as in the early cre@@ ide@@ period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time , as huge thermal di@@ odes , the carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , which stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs was pursued by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons he@@ avier monsters .
the scientists , their latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta has failed after death in the sea and then mut@@ tered in the mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sh@@ awn Funk , when he was in S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine close to Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the be@@ aded din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) weigh@@ ed .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch sp@@ ikes which ra@@ ged from his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant stress was w@@ aged through the Western Canada , until an floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the sea .
but the underwater re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of the Din@@ osau@@ r present its arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well received that the skin will still cover hol@@ low mo@@ red plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so rare as a profit in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the be@@ wil@@ dering becomes it .
pet@@ ri@@ fied resi@@ dual skin of the skin still cover the fet@@ al inj@@ ector plates that carry the sk@@ ul@@ ls of the animal .
his right front stand is on his side , his five fingers are pre@@ m@@ oo@@ ed upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
hot accident on Thursday night on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a massage bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , mile @-@ long St@@ ations - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age was injured about 20 people .
according to the first data of the police , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( County A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg District ) during a storm at approx 30 vehicles , including trucks , were also p@@ aired .
no information about the exact number of the last one before .
it is about light to moderate injuries , said a political pre@@ m@@ ity .
a great array of rescue vehicles was at the accident place .
the A8 towards Munich was fully closed .
in tr@@ end@@ ment of Munich , a roughly ten kilometres long retreat .
like a AZ @-@ re@@ porter , it also occurred on the way to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade has listed the identification number of the vehicles that now have to calculate with sensitive stra@@ ins .
shortly after 18 : 45 hrs the second accident took place on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
thus it came to a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group tested &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone already experienced : nothing was sitting in the train and sleeps .
or man is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : exhau@@ f .
comes the conductor and aw@@ ak@@ ens an un@@ gently or stri@@ ates the g@@ ast in the middle of the workflow .
ride control .
but the times of inter@@ ruptions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn has currently tested the convenient card control .
it is just confirmed by phone that you cap@@ tiv@@ ate its place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , wide , we reach it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be available for many other district routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway @-@ speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway clearance without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in order to use the use , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what else do they do for most passengers .
one must also have the App of the railway , the DB Navigator , what is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one climb@@ s to the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the test customers , a button on electronic unloading appears .
the train conductor will get a message to their mobile devices that Pass@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y .
comes with the train guide at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already built @-@ in online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue silent , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the client , one for the rail - which should be used for passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel in the DB navig@@ ator without ticket control by our train @-@ accompanying staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows passengers to design their travel time by train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB tel@@ correspondence .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who often goes through train , knows that next to delay and missed resort controls one of the biggest off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for often , in any case , however , one of the contribut@@ ors does not have all documents , which you need for the recycling of online tickets .
either lack the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document needed to make it .
the result are endless discussions between train conductors and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the part or major room and del@@ ays in the control of their own tickets , and the Schaff@@ ner at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken by the heart of Br@@ itt@@ any .
only one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis building was sitting on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b @-@ Apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ used , since nobody had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly wor@@ shipped on their tim@@ eline .
the z@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live twe@@ ets .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns animated body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; I thought Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for her and community .
she put your mobile phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later on the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people that cried out , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed an live feed in which a polic@@ eman has stood before a group of prot@@ esters with an inver@@ teb@@ ra@@ ked dog .
in another video , she said , as@@ sured another polic@@ eman his defense and sh@@ ou@@ ted : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alled her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us , and we can typically call themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt Sh@@ ake .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two on the next morning will drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a history of survival , love , and loss of power , the strength and resistance to be filled out of the perspective of people who live in the community , and the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Fer@@ rell went with her daughter , who drove a cau@@ li@@ ce and a matching crown , talking to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , pra@@ ises the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning . &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how black people have to fight for you , what will they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what they said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police had killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have to know it and it must be seen and moved in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution , and what we must do to free to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her a experience in which they personally does not have any ek@@ ep@@ ant rac@@ ism , it &apos;s not different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would have a bad service to hold them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became an old camp as the activists on the possible Non @-@ indictment of Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags , add them to prot@@ esters .
slowly , a new way of activ@@ ism began to accept Fer@@ rell &apos;s appearance .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August totally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Women &apos;s Association , and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congregations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met in the evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; what happened .
a question came by Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; you want to document or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism around death @-@ occup@@ ants .
his commitment brought the project closer to the project , along with six other loc@@ als , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brow@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not somebody who speaks for us or talking to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people will be displayed because I will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s experience - to show that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not around a Messiah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but for a community which comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participants in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
consequently , the documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s lives , as she loves and married her woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when they saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and to the human being of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s is repeated the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement which influenced the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Matter &quot; in 2012 following the killing of the black teen@@ ager carrying out the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Matter &quot; in 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in manag@@ erial positions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling to different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must bear the main load of all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really rise by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is however , however , that &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at Fer@@ rell &apos;s heart was chosen as the heart of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who touched this energy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , though she was in front of the fore@@ front , because in life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel its energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long van@@ ished , but the ra@@ cial connections between the municipality and the police remain .
Fer@@ rell is on the way for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : a chaos . &quot;
nonetheless , they have committed themselves to a singing , and she has committed to this memory , since it was three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; magn@@ itude &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although they are not yet built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone has been out@@ dated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
the topic can hardly be cold .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
while playing a bit @-@ gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; this would be real class &quot; ( Nicole swing ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or simply : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates had to build a gallery more customers in the city , of which the remaining shops take advantage of the fact that the pedestrian zone collapse .
in addition , the gallery will be planned exactly on the premises , on which the market market stands in which 13 direct products offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be at the end .
the Gallery @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building , namely the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady again very much gladly .
we have discovered the but@@ cher too for us .
we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there are also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; if you are direct mark@@ eted in a market hall in the gallery , reach the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is likely to be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping m@@ ates in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ in@@ ers or supermarkets , I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
of course there is enough in our city .
one sees how many stores are empty , some have been empty for months and years .
however , since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is so important that at least the market hall remains .
for all , the goods offered is fresh , mostly offered directly by producer , is ob@@ sc@@ end@@ ously inexpensive .
as you can see , stores are rented in a shopping center only from larger companies , because there are often not tra@@ gic for a retail@@ er .
shame , special stores there are almost no more , and what else is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit for Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmers market during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - also in duration if the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
or will it already make the gh@@ ost@@ st bit @-@ gallery previously , all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s easy to work .
and a shopping center that is empty , nobody needs .
with my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farm market , there is no more space thanks to the aw@@ ful many - how I find - sen@@ su@@ al construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no more space .
when the farmers market is broken down , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the center of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ atten@@ tive - to hang in cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ lights and hair cuts created by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ zer has banned a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having publicly traded diplomatic messages over the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called Bec@@ oming Res@@ emb@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline is based in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was converted , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA which could look and out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these genom@@ ic data could not only be considered with these genom@@ ic data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but since her pu@@ ber@@ ty has been openly spoken over the identification as a woman , in 2013 , among them six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fr@@ aud and theft .
by the prison , their image ex@@ presses her , so much that there was only one grain , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , located in the M@@ anning , argu@@ ably sits on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ inum blonde Persian is associated with it .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of stran@@ gers of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigar@@ ette silent and che@@ wing g@@ um by removing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of which people could look like this .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg explained in a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it could not be visited at that time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were conf@@ isc@@ ated with bri@@ m@@ unden , which inter@@ tw@@ ined several letters in the course of two years .
they even created a com@@ ic Comic &quot; Supp@@ liers Images , &quot; which was a future forec@@ asted , in which President chel@@ ated judgment would change , and it was able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama really was only few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings released after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of meeting .
there is also something deep in the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads an war against in@@ forman@@ ts from government camps and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ e@@ able ways to resolve the rigid divisions , which he should actually resolve to de@@ fl@@ aming .
as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a specific reason . &quot;
in one of the artistic statement , M@@ anning , with their over@@ sized signature ( &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) at the end of &quot; automatic attri@@ bution , whose foundation is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - an thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific enc@@ yc@@ lo@@ pedia of the artist ) how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological aspects , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people hopefully take part , our gen@@ ome is not , who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subj@@ ective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece of this exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned Comic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows M@@ anning , like playing with a hands @-@ on @-@ hand side from the disciplinary federation of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your words are cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still looking for go@@ ose , if I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition yet in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by mas@@ ks , from their own genom@@ ic simulation that gathered like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , man St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ ses were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that felt with Chelsea , as the movement looked after their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a nationwide man of lives in G@@ ange for a professor at the North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which had been sought as susp@@ ects after a man had killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .

Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for the social relations , said in an e @-@ mail declaration that L@@ ath@@ em had been buried in be@@ ur@@ ly and be excluded from the admission of the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a criminal case that investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is senior treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokesperson for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail address that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain in contact and ready to help us to help US investig@@ ative authorities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues sho@@ cked colleagues and want to set it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; we will conclu@@ de the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a particular stage in fulfilling the criteria of the schedule R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA chassis was updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of the WA@@ DA for compliance with the Code that describes the C@@ US@@ A@@ DA criteria and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria described in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities tried to accept the results from the WA@@ DA authorized by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in the Russian sport publicly supported by Canadian attor@@ ney .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation since our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we won &apos;t ad@@ mit anything , what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ iny Wor@@ ds agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping commission .
in conversation with Russian sales agency R@@ Sports at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , added : &quot; we had repeated that the controversial positions and regulations now contains .
nobody wanted to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
in November 2015 R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the d@@ oping sc@@ andal in Russia as part of d@@ oping control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of Moscow in July , WA@@ DA general manager Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves into the right direction &quot; in order to be used again .

start @-@ ups that will help your company to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent .
and even if you don &apos;t disc@@ ern on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers don &apos;t trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who is the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Gesellschaft and Madison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it called people from outside to help .
a new breed of human Resources Start @-@ ups is at W@@ ax@@ les to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to provide surveys , employees An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity and complaint @-@ Hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to go directly to the Board of Directors and to contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that they think an improved insight into what your staff think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it features a heat @-@ card of the company , which shows that units have most complaints and which managers can provide low additives results - so that you can drill down , why .
companies come to view that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you do not have the next U@@ ber , which has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since then , a former employee of a blog post , which describes a field of har@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments , where those who have spoken , pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .

Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and identify bad conduct , looking at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
he has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies offer customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , reliable responses in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line , which can be reported to the employee &apos;s specific behaviour .
and when the principal managing director are involved , complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that its staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience precious consequences due to consumers @-@ bo@@ yc@@ ott , workers @-@ flux and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has paid Conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel that said , there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ cent in@@ sist@@ s , problems previously were identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ so@@ fter intern - can be addressed and addressed .
&quot; I can come closer to these hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree view in the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take Ethics , Val@@ ues and Employ@@ ees in 2002 after the publishing company Arthur Andersen conducted for ethical violations of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that businesses knew that you could not prevent their dirty washing online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people &apos;s hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and buttons the company with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that takes the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million at the financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ inger secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
high sal@@ aries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated that your time will give you a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to be happy in a company that you feel the work that you &apos;re doing so it is worthwhile to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global benefits and Employ@@ ee Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors can reach R@@ end@@ ons , when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are working and engaged .
if the Analytics tools are promise to increase commitment and deployment of employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of an enterprise does not attack measures .
in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have a expect@@ ation that is changing to the way .
and if the change isn &apos;t fast enough , or not at all , this is dis@@ appo@@ inting and employees demo@@ tiv@@ ate .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4.000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to rely on the collecting of data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t worry about why , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who now passes monthly assistant @-@ p@@ olls , was able to invite measures on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re @-@ organising several teams within the company and to add several teams within the company to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company always preser@@ ves new insights on employee , and it hopes that in a long view , this leads to a better commitment of workers in an industry , known for high revenues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose men , you lose customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it goes on 23 clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint on one side of the new exercise fields of the team are enter@@ tained on the campus .
some have turned their tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ings and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these un@@ active guest represent a lunch break .
players who have written to the summer courses are returned after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final aud@@ iting before they return to water sports center next morning at 6 : 30 am next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ges @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the players completed already .
the compromise of two days is more than a day when the brood has moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school during Mor@@ as six play@@ hours in West@@ wood .
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . before the start of the formal games preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the change in the N@@ CAA support , even if they add a further point of time to the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place this enormous burden for three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are simply cr@@ ushed , they keep up , and they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really magnificent . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is terminated , according to the clear vision of its fields from an adjacent car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of elevated class , which has already clear@@ ed a protective net behind a tor@@ rent , no slight task .
brood @-@ players are supposed to occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem once the room are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched , that people rent a room , and then you can set up an exercise here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and of a practice , it &apos;s quite good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I don &apos;t have to worry about too big concerns .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with folders by third parties , and their results in original contributions then indicate the world &apos;s largest online social network in Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning techniques to reco@@ gn@@ ise possible fal@@ cons and send them to a fact @-@ check which may display the fact test results from the original article .
Facebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believed that they have also influenced the 2016 Presidential elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has become a major political issue in Europe with false stories in May , and Germany supported a plan according to social media networks , if they don &apos;t succeed , h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings like before the elections there in September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in English that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of the new facts review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the knowledge , what stories of fact @-@ pro@@ of@@ ed parties will try to make people more context to make sure they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature in the &quot; associated article &quot; and in other modifications to his messages feed to decrease wrong messages .
creating a Comic @-@ novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he had an hat@@ ch hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbul@@ ent story of his cozy seat in the G@@ ent River Valley and has now been inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ oph@@ a@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says W@@ eh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; spann@@ ed the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , coming British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acts on the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ par@@ ent in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters w@@ l always upon smoke , because then there was a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives over 300 years later , the smell has an effect as it would even be .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is sm@@ itten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I have thought a little over ) seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the vi@@ kt@@ orial &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and the many treasures and cour@@ ages of the castle , such as the mon@@ arch@@ ae@@ ology on walls and bottles , spent the centuries in the Gr@@ isons .
he emigrated through the premises and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ sc@@ ulpt@@ ors , gar@@ dener , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 when the latest Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he spoke as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats told &quot; Oh that they described it on the loft . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English emp@@ ires , maps , those who poss@@ essed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you could mean that land fli@@ ers be bor@@ ing bor@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhodes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fought for two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let &apos;s go all about it ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter a wider basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which is the newly built castle to join the pe@@ asant revol@@ ved of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ots that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Ros@@ of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ asant began in this area and I thought , a rebellion was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe they are inter@@ connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit priest seven years during the English re@@ formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers is depic@@ ted by Arthur Dar@@ rell in the 18th century when he staged its own fun@@ eral , having filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that had been excav@@ ated only after years later ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are Rhodes &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen to be terrible g@@ aun@@ er to make money again and spend money for things which they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men del@@ etes their school cris@@ es by giving rich old women - I set it to me as a he@@ ap @-@ looking boys , with a talent in order to learn er@@ binnen . &quot;
after the end of its set in the castle , Rhodes is searching for other unique sh@@ rei@@ b experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ her@@ men &apos;s territory , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , I have to be finished with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ us@@ elle clo@@ aked in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ us@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched her campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau von Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team wants to hold Nelson Art@@ z the logo and slogan .
at the end of August , it should be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; great for us .
or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t think that ( of course ! ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t really write it on their un@@ folded web@@ page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make clear that it &apos;s better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm convic@@ tion that we highly know as a bathroom Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
in the action , it &apos;s more than just &quot; a logo and a slogan that is called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a unique promise that gives the city a distinctive all @-@ adjustable feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they understand in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honnef is a medium five @-@ digit amount to the new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fears in front of the army
every year in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es about retirement schemes and transport in the officer cor@@ ps .
such as this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as early as previously , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
he also participated in the advis@@ ors under the presidency of the Heads of Government also the five Vice @-@ Chair , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus civilians were in the Y@@ as in the over@@ sight .
the government draws the bre@@ ed@@ geh@@ ogs in the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the Commander of the He@@ eres , Air Force and Marine survey@@ ed .
since the failed coup , President Erd@@ og@@ an 169 has fired 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as clin@@ ker &apos;s attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly at the coup attempt , this week is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup attempt , Erd@@ og@@ an had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine present &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he gave him the opportunity to clean the forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but is Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s army really under control ?
in late February the newspaper &quot; Hur@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general staff there is concern for an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islamic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army which manifested themselves among other things in the repe@@ al of the head @-@ ban for Sol@@ dat@@ esses , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grand cleaning of the army and the security forces certainly go further .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an re@@ signed by decree for another 73@@ 95 citizenship , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed more than I t@@ amed the military as I have Erd@@ og@@ an .
gener@@ als earlier than the actual gent@@ l@@ emen of the country .
three times carried on appeal to their role as the gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s power pushed forward to the power of the military intervention by calling for the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers are saying that Erd@@ og@@ an drivers are specifically targeted to Islam@@ ization of forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , a well @-@ called officer , who sought for asylum from persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that such development could not allow Nat@@ o to be cold .
in this alliance , there is dou@@ b@@ ts about pur@@ ities , dou@@ b@@ ts about the deployment of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; managers and oper@@ ation@@ ellen were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nat@@ o diplom@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , &quot; said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he sees to lower legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for the authorization of vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed under the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the way by the US as the citizens from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates that speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and will show knowledge of our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
ministry wants to san@@ ize the track for race track
again , in the past months over the future of the race track was denied - now it should go very quickly .
before the end of the year is scheduled to be built on the mar@@ ker track , on which the tourist railway runs .
in order to secure the future of the track sh@@ utt@@ les long @-@ term , according to the traffic of the Ministry of Education , this year construction will start on the track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order the route Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country became important for tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Transport State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was approximately 2.5 million Euros .
this sum will take 75 percent of this sum .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , will presently be tuned , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Thuring@@ ians train as operators are already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the road@@ map that negoti@@ ated the vehicles and the quality standards &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
this means that the race track will be ordered to be regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot business in the past few months , the track of plenty of people was used to re@@ order them again in the future .
the circuit is also highly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the climb of sex robots is real , and we should be wor@@ ried
just as you thought that there will not be crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments within the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we must begin to take it seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ on in the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon , which feels warm , with consci@@ ously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust its robot according to his belie@@ fs &quot; and choose everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot about the form of ni@@ p@@ ples by type or the color of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there will still be wor@@ r@@ ying , as many robots have the &quot; Person@@ alities &quot; that would look progressive @-@ woman progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicon .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example its users to customize their robot to the properties , as well as student mobility .
and then there are the True Compan@@ ion C@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ying and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the True Compan@@ ion website &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she may like what you like , and do not like what you like , etc .
it also has its vocal in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many be@@ ati@@ ful aspects of this scen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but under@@ taking a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : ir@@ regul@@ ating ) Far@@ rah is going to un@@ calm a most .
true on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not only a feeling or simply just another sexual plane .
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a slightly dar@@ ker and deeper understanding in our culture , on a retreat from the Ideal of Gender equality to a desire for sex with sub@@ jection as optional addition .
most men will naturally do no sex robots , and while FR@@ R anticip@@ ates their rising popularity , they still remain pre@@ limin@@ arily on the edge of consumer culture .
but what per@@ me@@ ates out of the boundary zones , can be found in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until them the free market permit .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are present in a time , in which the rights of women are threatened by the White House , who spoke in order to attack women sexually .
the most terrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the bond@@ woman &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the hidden body and the out@@ stretched eyes but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind this sex robots , there is a physical simil@@ arity to actual women to produce so realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , if it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; the robots do not constitute real women .
you can &apos;t separate or simply go away from their companion .
they do not have transmission or background history , nothing , anything on independence , or anything , what the imagination could distur@@ b the imagination .
different terms : you are counter@@ feit slaves .
or to express it in the Re@@ de@@ wise in 2017 : serv@@ icing
Tr@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the In@@ jection of Heal@@ thy Human Rights
it became a Bin@@ sen@@ su@@ ish@@ ness of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions have polarized the US @-@ v@@ oters , which have divided families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ le there was in the U.S. newspapers with advice about how to choose from the hor@@ ror of b@@ ump @-@ selectable relations .
we will appreciate all the supp@@ os@@ edly , around our filter bub@@ bles .
less has been noted , the power of Tr@@ umps and families have been comp@@ assed .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ directed ti@@ lit@@ ter , who lives in Chicago , and has long been dealing with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , who has visited me this week in New York .
they remin@@ ded me that the unit can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
around the dining table , this certainly is a good cause , but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks .
the Left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
if we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens cannot be thr@@ ust anymore .
there is , however , a fri@@ ght@@ ful long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear to appear in comparison to his standards as inc@@ eption of gener@@ osity .
I find me nowadays by active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of dec@@ lining - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , who saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we did , like his tax returns ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild Stra@@ w@@ ling .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans will only be mentally healthy to qualify as an indispensable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of Car@@ ou@@ sel in New York &apos;s park , and the top three dollars to spend in the city if one needs no caff@@ eine .
the horses are enorm@@ ously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs in the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ushing and the animals are turning round about their own shoul@@ ders - extreme dark and clim@@ atic music .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city will dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not be a dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m not all over the day , when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
but the Central Park Car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on and all have a great time .
if I would have been able to rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him full score , but fortunately nobody asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same thing plus the option to exclu@@ de the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down in what actually is a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ ous , while I we@@ ary the experience , you submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us re@@ loc@@ ating chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit to the second time .
in the past year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten , who suffered the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers now need to know
how exactly is the software update instead of ?
must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers on an overview .
at the diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group has offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the emissions of emissions from emission classes Euro 5 and in part 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin by ACE Auto Club Europe are ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the handled software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates are valid only for vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their re@@ arm@@ ament has arranged the Federal Railway Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the coming months , but not yet known for an accurate date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler informed us to write every person concerned .
if you assume an inspection , it will be done in their frame .
how long will the retro@@ f@@ itt@@ ens move up ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin writes .
the curtains of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturer does not act on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming , it could be an appointment .
what do car drivers do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE does not need to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive prize fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving jobs are threatened .
in rural areas there is no value losses for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE does , with sales are still waiting to wait .

we make the city alive
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente in the next year .
the place is already written - suitable candidates are regist@@ rar .
since 31 years W@@ acker City &apos;s Builder is .
and the work makes him still great fun , how he convey@@ s in the press conference .
it reports varied , but challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time I wonder that previously , no application is fulfilled the requirements of requirements .
the city is looking for the next possible time an architect or construction engineer .
that way - considering the regular term of term - still enough time for a preparation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; da Has@@ lach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acts as a Unter@@ e Building Authority , the applicant must refer to respective degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this function wants to retain the city every case .
if they can &apos;t fill this no more , citizens would have to leave for advice until Offen@@ burg .
however , the city is close to the city and itself important , says W@@ acker who reported by a good working atmosphere as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing the city alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure he is about the building office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the future , diversi@@ fied projects can be found on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a centre and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ land parking lot are mentioned .
the Kin@@ z@@ ig@@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the stage san@@ itation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter only will strike around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here makes fun . &quot;
con@@ gest@@ ed is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of large playing space .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construction farm and Gär@@ t@@ ner@@ ei , can be flexibly re@@ acted to many times .
&quot; you can often move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of green plants will often praise citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; a eye that fits , &quot; when new buildings will be approved , emphasi@@ zes the separ@@ ating city designer .
anyway , the cit@@ adel has high responsibility .
he is builder , &quot; at the end everything goes on my table . &quot;
for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for assistance and coordination at the age of ten , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we seek someone who really identi@@ fies and remain with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the other design of the city .
if Roland W@@ acker wants to look after the information of the town of Has@@ lach , graduate engineer or Bachelor with professional knowledge of architecture and expertise in the fields of construction and construction work .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under construction and civil engineering , building planning , se@@ under@@ ings , urban farm house with construction farm and urban hus@@ band@@ ry , as well as lower right @-@ rights including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : southern route blo@@ cked
according to the police , previously unknown offen@@ ders had the blue bike from the railway gle@@ hold on the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were severely damaged so that the her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ating freight train would have to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and looking for the night hours after them .
near the crime there were witnesses of a pink rolling and a bike rider .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ yed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators brought themselves at themselves in great danger and endanger@@ ed the train transport .
in addition to the damage at the Lo@@ k and the installation and the cost of rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen @-@ customers may also meet the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south track could be conducted without disabilities .
almost ten dishes were exhau@@ sted Friday afternoon , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight lifts are not turned out , but it was delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged approximately 200 metres of high lines .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help prevent IB@@ D ( Flamm@@ able intestinal diseases )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims that the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could cause symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the inc@@ ur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000 , causes stomach ul@@ sions and par@@ aly@@ sis , recur@@ ring or bloo@@ dy cr@@ ashes , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the suffer@@ ers usually come to avoid meat and milk products , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins to develop immune cells , which promote toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immun@@ o@@ cells at the Dar@@ m pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes to hide themselves in food , do not penet@@ rate in the body .
cells , which are able to resolve inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is inclined towards inflammation , it can result in an anti @-@ inflammatory disease .
in Experim@@ ents , it was determined that a sort of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell in mice , which contribute to a certain bacter@@ ium in its bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus re@@ uter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an mice had their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and an important tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an diet toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel @-@ lie@@ us encour@@ ages the same system even in humans .
the post@@ doctoral degree in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan wrote a kind of immune cell which had found tolerance as it was found that a group of study mice had such cells , but it was isolated , but that was not isolated .
it suspected that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ous mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i usually live in the gast@@ ro @-@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice have been DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but lack@@ ed mice .
mice were dis@@ ast@@ ered in a ster@@ ile environment , so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was not developed and they were not developed by L. re@@ uter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria results in the immune system , the researchers left L. re@@ uter@@ i to grow in a fluid and then carried small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleans@@ ed from the fluid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an metabolism that is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in mice , increasing the number of such cells by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us can protect L. re@@ uter@@ i in our gast@@ ro @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known as Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an products from L. re@@ uter@@ i to develop cells in people like in mice , but defects in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
the potential , high @-@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values of L. re@@ uter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; Genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against Samp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pounds of Sign@@ ature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA Champions Cup at Tuesday begins , and impres@@ sing at the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
M@@ atic was excluded from the blues @-@ Asia tour of the blues and abol@@ ished only 45 minutes to improve Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in nature , how he th@@ inks - he th@@ inks of football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him , so@@ oner than later be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started at Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent disclos@@ ed in this week , that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wanted three additional re@@ members , but it existed that the club has already accomplished a &quot; fantastic work , &quot; three of its four main mandatory comm@@ it@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , thank you for the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happy if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

new r@@ ash for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns it , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still working as the SPD head , S &amp; D pre@@ sidents succeed in accordance with some concern in Berlin .
only no distur@@ ban@@ ces from the party &apos;s headquarters , only no counter @-@ wind from the federal government - thus , the most important desire of elect@@ oral batt@@ les@@ hip .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundament@@ ally .
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with increasing the events in the SPD @-@ governing state capit@@ als have been observed .
what Schulz has been given from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described by counter @-@ wind times .
there were deep suggestions .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the German Federal Government provides a general signal against Ko@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s once more : red @-@ green can &apos;t be locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU @-@ Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , editor @-@ network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising spokes@@ woman of a Green @-@ M@@ EPs led the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the country code lost its red @-@ green coalition to make their One @-@ votes majority to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German CEO Michael Kell@@ ner turned the back@@ drop Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ling to return their mand@@ at .
the transition to the CDU means a clear dis@@ appointment of v@@ oters .
El@@ ke T@@ ire will immediately return to its mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and Election Manager of Green to the Deutschland Editor ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sig@@ h an SPD @-@ election , as on Friday afternoon , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party &apos;s headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without his own governmental majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small cris@@ es in the SPD @-@ country associations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the com@@ rades .
everything will be different after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
that was then too - and everything was worse and worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to s@@ wap the D@@ usseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the Party .
the com@@ rades looked forward again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just exhau@@ sted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next r@@ ash came .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his city .
and because he &apos;s doing something wrong in the crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz is fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW exhaust gas aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister had already been in criticism of the criticism .
Mi@@ ese circum@@ fra@@ y came .
nevertheless , or perhaps even , W@@ eil tried to put forward in the past few weeks , too , in the Bund Ak@@ z@@ ente .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the order of the former Mayor of Hannover , to expand his power in Berlin , was not hid in the field of Martin Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they let him grant him , as they gave up a stabilization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in that time , W@@ eil meets at the parti@@ ality Between the Lower Saxony that is basically no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz won &apos;t even happen .
therefore , the companions of the com@@ rades have to be closed , which is closed in its own ranks .
their anger rests on the green , and here especially on the tr@@ un@@ ched par@@ liam@@ entar@@ ism in bu@@ oy@@ ancy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Mrs. t@@ om their own career interests through the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the parties in the SPD @-@ German Bundestag Act , the Editor Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ ass is not a direct @-@ did@@ acy because of her person as director , but on the state of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party ( Lower Saxony ) , the Lower Sax@@ on dep@@ u@@ ties .
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Head of the SPD German Bundestag Act , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ oters in front of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil to minister @-@ pre@@ sidents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as a leading candidate in the German Bundestag election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of a future CDU @-@ M@@ EPs set the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked , clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know if there have been more or more additional additions of the CDU Lower Saxony .
conveyor belt for Ort@@ ner III
who wants to walk in the year &apos;s coming house can get soon coming from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ atic urban development received on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review to the previously sh@@ eh@@ ouse .
since 1991 it has been generating units in the rehabilitation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thir@@ ds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote interior development , and not only new construction areas .
on April 4 you will receive the information from the government to Karlsruhe , that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
the total amount will be 8@@ 33 333 Euros including 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church .
how is a rehabilitation area now ?
you will continue to examine the Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it plays an important role in the planned area of all interest , to san@@ iti@@ ze .
eventually , the borders may also be post@@ pon@@ ed .
the St@@ eg stood on Wednesday evening , Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federation of the Federation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will then be performed within the framework . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the re@@ loc@@ alization of inner cities to improve residential and employment relationships and maintenance of infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , is carried out per property .
the sanctuary would then finally set as a stat@@ ute .
the licence period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , only the inventory would be conducted , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation centres involved a questionnaire .
in November or December , as possible , as possible , the Sat@@ anist will begin to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
according to Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann , it subsequently declared that every local Commun@@ e can carry out pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s go to rate and decide on urban mis@@ calculations , when it is sanc@@ tified and in what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will then be entered in the book book for the respective land .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again be received once again and get a picture of the situation , she said .
Got@@ zel continued , a major success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
therefore , there will be question@@ n@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks , until the end of the summer holidays can be filled out .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and plot arch &quot; in which it is among other things about the structural condition and refurb@@ ishment .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; House@@ hold and housing , &quot; can provide information about size , distribution and residents of a residential room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will only fill in the building business premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Go@@ zel showed that there is no application for funding simultaneously at the same time .
restructuring measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ unds principle &quot; works - who first comes , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
you could not reserve any conveyor belt for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project was shown to make the Pres@@ ent a Re@@ furb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself puts a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in the house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country that will be equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his own door , and even with a hand movement can start his car .

the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House decision to fly a n@@ avy hel@@ icop@@ ters to the South La@@ wn for an event that brings American production over the last month , cost tax@@ pay@@ ers to the military service , which have been handed over to TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , is the president of the event , was the heart of the event held at the White House in the White House on July 17 .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and leading officials of the White House , made a tour of all 50 states .
the helicopter shown in Connecticut , was issued alongside a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the White House Military Office requested the presence of hel@@ icop@@ ters in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before helicopter landing at the South La@@ wn , following the record of the Marine Hel@@ icopter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware that it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote the Commander of the Military Marine Minister for Aviation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed , until the lawn was clear@@ ed between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note that if your departure should be delayed from the White House , a second team would require a second team for return flight .
the original air@@ crew was during the helicopter during the helicopter , while the security personnel remained during the time on the ground .
from the TIM@@ E notes provided , it wasn &apos;t clear that ultimately , a second flight crew was necessary .
the H@@ atch Act prohib@@ its federal property to use state property for political purposes .
record datas@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could act the determination .
&quot; a question that we noted , was whether there was a violation of the H@@ atch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; all sounds when you are locked , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was named by the White House and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President issued a violation of the reform of the Healthcare Reform , which was in the Senate in G@@ ange , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts towards ob@@ taining the government regulations .
the use of the plane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly any new phenomenon from politically beneficial .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP , is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump led a study on the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products of all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy press of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently lead training flights in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn through to en@@ force US President in the White House with precise Zenti@@ s .
at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 exercises .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted the airline &apos;s training requirement for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units also flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers had no load for any of the other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
a speaker of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in recru@@ iting the hel@@ icop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintains bud@@ get@@ ary entries for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
record of the unity list the flight time of plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers to be established on the basis of estimates for the equi@@ voc@@ ations is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are contained in the annual funds . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the entry sets for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract statements .
at that time , the former press conference of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ells , defended the action of hel@@ icop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ .
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are proud that they contribute to our national security , and I am from that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on .
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the hel@@ icop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have been rel@@ ent@@ lessly lab@@ our@@ able .
it is naturally appropriate to emphasi@@ ze this . &quot;
it was not clear that Tr@@ ump was inter@@ act with helicopter when he comes to his tour through the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ ling with the media about its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC @-@ White Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at the Tab@@ le@@ third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV starting at 11 o &apos;clock .
despite the five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance , the leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga has received the meaning for reality .
team Chef Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has certainly respect for the opponent .
&quot; that &apos;s a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
straight on the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , mainly the imports come from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whose Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to inserts in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views on Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; that becomes very difficult for us .
you also need good serving happiness . &quot;
the ne@@ us@@ ser squ@@ ad for the trip in the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ and @-@ white might give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .

how America can h@@ urt the OMV
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy , when he continued his signature on the sanctions against Russia as a Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his h@@ ast , the law en@@ act , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adopted a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he contained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels will be ash@@ amed against the U.S. im@@ pet@@ us .
after all , the draft is to be pun@@ ished with European companies that help the Rus@@ sians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
accordingly , since then , investors of the domestic OMV , which co @-@ financed jointly with other European firms , are co @-@ financed by the Russian Baltic Sea Region Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is tremendous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are elected for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to which the Group could conf@@ use and which could really h@@ urt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the town presents 46 coast@@ ers
the city organizes the Kit@@ a @-@ mid@@ table once again .
with fixed contact partners for children and assignment to the team .
the watch is turned back in the municipal day@@ care centres .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) once again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid , is this good news : &quot; we all have very pleased . &quot;
cooked by the house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh@@ ly bo@@ iled bo@@ iled .
the city operates in the area of 46 children &apos;s ven@@ ues , where 44 children are at lunch@@ time a warm meal .
last year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is constantly growing .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who can take care of 45 hours in the Kit@@ a lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour assistance , if children remain up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 partial forces from 1 September kitchen service : heat up the fishing meal , supplement them to make let@@ tu@@ ce , raw food and fruit , feeding your meal , give food from , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a kit@@ a , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group units as well as sevent@@ een institutions - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen staff now belongs to the Kit@@ a @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that &apos;s why it is : healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help , prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen counter @-@ power could be useful .
also suitable for children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the Kit@@ a , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the Kit@@ a @-@ rooms - so far the task of coast@@ line - will now be done by special det@@ erg@@ ent personnel .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power also the charm that they chose in the cost between own reg@@ im@@ y and foreign to the city as the most economical solution , called it from the press office .
and that , although 46 partial forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the Educational Sector not so heavily in weight &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investing in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
with managers of the Bis@@ k@@ ite @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie wants to make some long @-@ term commitment to the production at its work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said , the company was beyond the future of investing in the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work , that manufactures beside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its .
in recent years , Mc@@ vi@@ ties owners Pla@@ dis said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that representatives and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first to learn if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s Fili@@ al@@ head of the company , G@@ MB Scotland asked Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns so that financing for the moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be driven . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies , affecting our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have been working here and the workforce concentr@@ ates strongly on the local community and the large area of Glasgow , an important column for de@@ cent employment in a area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ ageous situation .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , pay@@ roll , and prosper@@ ity , and before the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing cost of life and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently need a fl@@ oral production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ al@@ cross at T@@ oll@@ cross was only yesterday a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to that , as we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate like all businesses that are active in an extremely competitive commercial and uncer@@ tain commercial law , and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
they added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross country , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reco@@ gn@@ ise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . you should change our business processes at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago ?
the page of La League may interest their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave in its persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar after they had an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ sol@@ ve his fre@@ ot@@ al island , but did Barcelona war@@ ned over the world three years ago ?
the sensational approach has been heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than doubled the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds worth Manchester United .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the highest paid professional athletes born in the world . PS@@ G provides wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry with the way that Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way to the outside of the Catal@@ ans @-@ Management , although the club has always given its existence since its arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but was the football world war@@ ned over three years ago from the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City was interested in Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di &apos;s interest in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not concerned , because they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players to sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
this line seems to have crossed this line with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly made that they could not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this inter@@ esses by losing their prices for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report &quot; released Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report on the abuse of ab@@ stain@@ ed by Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the Miss@@ ing andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to discuss discussions .
Christian Weis@@ ner , spokesperson of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained according to the publication of the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Dom@@ en@@ voy Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would very serve the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep@@ en@@ during their own sub@@ missions or their then wrong assessment of operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Chancellor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that against violence at Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the convic@@ tions in Regensburg , no one would have to be prevented for &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; handle , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church , as a source of all evil experience , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also inter@@ ce@@ de Gloria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be happy to go on the church and this is a little f@@ aint Fres@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it pointed out that in her youth , &quot; be@@ ats have been quite normal &quot; ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; to be done , &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one . &quot;
they fires un@@ fair , today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger frequently appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who written with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Bro@@ ther of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written in 12 languages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented to the German di@@ ocese of Regensburg by the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; summar@@ ize that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. were applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emo@@ tion@@ ality , the punishment for pupils could also be severe .
in contrast to numerous other certifications , many victims fell by R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are linked with him . &quot;
in an interview Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the Miss@@ ing sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger behind his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ation of Viol@@ ation at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for an lifting many students of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it appears as ch@@ anc@@ eric and perf@@ ection@@ ist , one of the Ö@@ f@@ teren , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz made no top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and reads all 440 pages long report from the front till the back , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all at all .
it is just eight pages dedicated and it will be clear@@ ed from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the middle or co @-@ witness with the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the force of violence on the pre @-@ school happened outside of its active sphere .
you can disc@@ lose him if it &apos;s too late or first clari@@ fications do not have taken seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ d@@ ents - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents an excellent witness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; popular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correctly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and always be surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority is committed to its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emo@@ tion@@ ality , which also led to anger qu@@ arri@@ es .
that he did not only threw those with chairs and laid the keys on the ground , but also ear@@ mu@@ red boys in the hair or ears , he has abandoned himself , deeply re@@ gre@@ ening , and ap@@ olog@@ ized for it .
however , to his honour , however , such correc@@ tive methods in frag@@ ment@@ ing time , the 1960s and 1970s were widespread , with parents like in teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think of us was born before 1968 .
I &apos;ve also experienced that in a sec@@ ular school , a state Gymnasium .
compared to that , in fact , in this report , it goes in this report , namely the ab@@ norm@@ ality of sexual abuse and violence at pre @-@ school , the liber@@ ated Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
then you can &apos;t ask if it did not think to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and his role as brother by Benedikt XV@@ I. , that many media over@@ threw him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many who never have understood him , still e@@ ager@@ ly .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the context , a lot about the subject of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant was reported in connection with this report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger become at the final report also in regard to sexual abuse during the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual gri@@ ps claims to have entrusted to the cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never get@@ ed me to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There was everything very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem in the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse has been , however , most victims of jack@@ als are silent .
if they didn &apos;t listen to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral conductor , who would have been working as a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to sexual abuse ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had a tim@@ ely findings and could have the respective off@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it ... also for really absur@@ d , to accept that ... Bub@@ bles have urg@@ ent or clear@@ er or even more , than against their parents , Inter@@ nat@@ s@@ conduc@@ tors , confidentiality instruc@@ tors etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report on the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance , the pupils and / or their surroundings could not be entrusted to him in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free of all fellow citizens .
thus , it cannot be accused of having taken him or brought him not .
therefore there is no reason to bring its good name with these contra@@ dic@@ tory crimes , as it was unfortunately in some cases .
in the media a lot of &quot; violence to be read &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former cathedral @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of the &quot; Path &quot; report .
do he have to live with this cast ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the great problem that in the reporting is mixed and men@@ stru@@ ed anything from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , exactly this is an abuse of the report .
it is so clean : between the pre@@ school and the school of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
Moreover , the report deals with events from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger isn &apos;t the Chor@@ us of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole hor@@ ri@@ ble ped@@ agog@@ y ped@@ agog@@ y , cases in which the boys suffered from s@@ adi@@ sti@@ cal teachers , and of them suffered tremend@@ ously , occurred at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have prev@@ ailed .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
in fact , as the most witnesses believed , the theme &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was just happy to come and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ ental &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was discipline in discipline , but no s@@ adi@@ sches violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at the conclusion of the report that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fell by R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment , most of the pre@@ ach@@ ute have to be moved away .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods , in which it was reported by the conditions at pre @-@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and took part in a school , at which he was not working and responsible , ( so the Wit@@ ness ) wanted nothing to hear and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shut down the ears before the conditions ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which was even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will continue to practice the test penalty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre@@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative pres@@ u@@ als , he received urg@@ ent advis@@ ing .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was not banned in Bavaria , even in Bavaria .
before , they happened in a legal au@@ au@@ zone , as everyone knows we know .
it was difficult to estimate him , where the suffer@@ ers may have been ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatically , where the permissible limit was exceeded .
you can &apos;t say , but he would have always st@@ owed away .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 the test sentence of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Für@@ y Gloria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ori@@ ans talking about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ ach@@ a@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus the Dan@@ ger , last to today &apos;s moral . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princ@@ ess has already quite right .
but this is not true for sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able to all times , and not for what happened in pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s camps , which goes far beyond that time .
that &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it is finally asc@@ ended .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipline and punishment , so ear parties and ears to draw , were widespread far in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also kept strictly confidential .
which picture from his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Period , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My Bro@@ ther of Pope ? &quot;
came the subject of testing also to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , the cathedral spar@@ rows played only one side .
nevertheless , I lost no means that it led a str@@ ingent reg@@ iment there .
but this must also be said once : without these perf@@ ection@@ ism , without having un@@ question@@ ably un@@ condition@@ ally known reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , it would probably have been possible to form a nation @-@ known reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone there is no big singers but in front of every success , equal to what area , still discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what people have you experienced for George R@@ atz@@ inger in the conversations regarding their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I &apos;ve experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well and always experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep @-@ heart@@ ed , deeply gl@@ amor@@ ous and heart@@ ed people , from which one can &apos;t imagine , that he could do just a fly something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regularly receive with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his embar@@ king , regularly visit him to visit him - he &apos;s almost blin@@ dly - and how to treat him as a member of her family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who didn &apos;t forgive him until today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are today gr@@ ate@@ ful for him to en@@ riches their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he always was a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict Father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ or@@ son , to which they still watch and honour it .
and , once again , clearly : everything that acc@@ uses to him are correc@@ tive methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it &apos;s very un@@ fair , a man , only because he was promin@@ ently and has a prominent brother to make medi@@ al sin@@ ks .
since is the evil intention that behind it is only too obvious .
for the report , which was just released , was reli@@ eved .
now the applicant would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and probably no one without the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Germany ) would finally know in peace .
