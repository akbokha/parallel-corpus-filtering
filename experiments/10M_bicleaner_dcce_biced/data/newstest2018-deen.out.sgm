<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your look at the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where youths should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A cryptic chapel, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gardeners manage the rusty ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everybody who had to have had to play a green meadow instead of a bypass road instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the Digital Bavaria-Atlases, an area of the Geoportas Bayern of the State Government, are everything other than the current - but is therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then there will be clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of Munich's Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a FlickenteppI, which one can not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the Great Supervisors for cities and municipalities, more detailed maps, so-called primitive leaves have been incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">The first survey of the Bavarian State Surveyors were created between 1810 and 1864 and decreasing the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon requested a survey of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey Bayerns on behalf of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even when the French troops moved with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, today's neighbours, who carved the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max. Joseph goes further ahead, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian State Administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition of Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all other items on the Bayerische Staatsoper's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is most impressive in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is submerling, which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was donated 21 years after the drawing of the card, i.e. 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses subtracing focus around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian farmers in Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is, there is nothing more than fields - at first sight: when entering into the first glance a small-part card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called "Urination," derived from the base tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots prove there today no farmers more - but the gardener of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfests, was actually a meadow and no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the context of the present district Au-Haidhausen, in the context of today's district au-Haidhausen, you can not just read the street names "at the Gastens" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you unlocked man with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt 'was created on the Auer Lüders.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "it was advanced to his time and ended for example the dressing of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he is prohibited to apply force violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has occupied an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circus institute in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people are now meeting in the Munich Salesanum at the area of former auctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth house with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residence in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was erected in an architectural reference to the origins of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raid.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "" "Head Square" "", "the merchants called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the bombs of the Allies broke out many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a cryptic chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at Marienhof, where these days work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights published travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Advancement of Farming has issued a warning for colored people, based on discrimination policy and racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which aims to enter into force by 28 August 2017, urges country-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of fragmenting, road-based precases occur throughout the state and here," said in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved law of Missouri, which makes people heavier, discrimination-discrimination, as well as the prosecuting authorities of the state, disproportionately on minorities, said the group to release the travel warnings, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of the civil rights which people will happen." ""</seg>

<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency, which we haven't heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group reported incidents like racist persecutions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "Sanders died in fragmenting circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline more by the state and was accused by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime." ""</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report of the Office of Missouri's Office of Missouri, where black car drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whiteness.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that human beings are aware of and their families, friends and employees, what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring out their money money, or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the Hassverbial report of the FBI, who settle the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Act that would make it difficult to lay a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States immigration laws had to undertake people because of immigration authorities, which will contribute to further ratification.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent days, stakeholders have been applied to reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Crossover project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Weiheracher Weidezvn-Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-German parlorded Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided a painting on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies, representatives of the CDU-outskirts of the family Schwendemann met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann, initially acquired insights into his operation in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest cultivated, 40 dairy cows and also many young dogs and houses five apartments arranged.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "SchwarzwaldMilk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Panama's table tennis table comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also called BLHV-Chairman from Fischerbach, he described the 'elementary project as "elementar."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit on such areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area should be processed for much work, many mills with the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the elteristic operation and management of this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, also being able to conduct biooperations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider is clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the decanter project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers in the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the surface of the land could still be undressed as a whole wropes.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture, and thoughts are making their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often standing in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The opening area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be stopped until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half of the leader was funded by the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers stay for 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat debris.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and Farming it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter White:" "" "the best foods are produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscapes Zone (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pastoral care.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR-recorded promoters.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "furthermore, the unflawless area should be non-deductible (slope up to 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the collection." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">The application is currently running on the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 km of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs of more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty now</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is, when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these equally as every other - therefore the sorrowed downfall of Saddam Hussein's Firm place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did, when he did a symbolic act in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta by CNN about the expo-restriction of the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty-Imitators have asked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to her, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta, "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, the world lightens.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, which was added later and not part of the Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the stumblest of the poor," "" "Your labor, your poor, and your distress," "" "to breathe freely," "" "the waste of your rich coast." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time to look better in the "eleventh waste" on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Don't care in literary criticism - he clearly made that those people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who use their words to place their death after their death, did not know that they have completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show links between French and American Republicism, in an unused classical image representation the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus modified this meaning: in their poem is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there himself is a very different name: mother of exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a disastrous attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change this long wing in the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great terror as Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no longer an early neo-conservative, that bring American flame into the converted world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine through the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusual is Limbaugh to stumble here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great-imaginative approach of Lazarus was composed of Lazarus in it, as they seen from the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the Decks of Ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Your statue speaks to them the words of hope and will of the welcome which they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, don't recognise the perspective, the Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not shine through the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black loaves Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two carrots belonged to the United Kingdom's team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the World Championship can make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to find out," "" said Black. "" "</seg>
<seg id="134">"I say with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that something has done with him what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has done something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butler, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5000 m circuit, while Eiliie Doyle was chosen to Team's team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, regardless of it, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and genuine sensation that Eiliie were quite natural, were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, which is in their fifth world championships for the 400 m hurdles, says it "incredibly" is that 16 scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">In this way, Muir runs on this path and has positioned in five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman to observe the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminds on her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team capitalists says that they are "enormously proud of" the fact that many of their countrymen do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also among medals and in the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "this is special about team capitalists, so that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that anyway, my team colleagues have voted for me and voted for me something very special for me" "" "added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the carrots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows just how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to Podes.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech concerns as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think they went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home Championships.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefiting from that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it's just like that a great atmosphere there will be outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of Critics about Facebook: vertebravel not to a public office if you don't tolerate the voters of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him for everything, from the Domestic Policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He chimped in criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he does not have his critic to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in the year 1783, Washington said," "" "the freedom of freedom can be taken away - and, dumm, and silent, as sheep are led to the battles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work for more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked the contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union condemns him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counter-action with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor, in an overwhelming democratic state who is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the doubleed approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He showed a firm hand in leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as primary means to combine with his voters and play his hairless head to chemotherapy on his page.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, blocking of those who come to the Governors page - which is officially designated as official, and by employees who are paid to public tax-Dollars, unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogan Interim Interim Chasse the activities of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing further than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of Trolles or spikers or boiling people that swinging online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post said with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>

<seg id="191">But exactly what happens especially digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials, who is criticised for it to implies Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users, blocked by Twitter feeds.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, known to have a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of an affordable portrait had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers often spread between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mailens based on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even then Washington had anonymous troubles.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius-Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church on the old cemetery-area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30 o'clock to a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius plant a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth benefit-serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tumour to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini states: "it is a unique döriodine."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was mentioned for the first time in the Württuerttemberg urbook: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the present parish church on Tumlingen and the Vogt Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, upon the Tumlinger mountain, besides the former parish church, a splendid farm, belonged to the church or the Patronatsworth, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the subvillage and the Oberdorf, which is still visible today in the town of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the romantic settlements of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps of the period around the year 1600 subwalls these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The Patronatsworth was created from the early medieval owner church.</seg>
<seg id="477">A Lord, who built a church, was buried with a pastor, and remained with a pastor, and was able to inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus, the right to insert a pastor, or propose a new pastor pastor.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars were in the church, and two bells in the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger of the two pieces at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created Glocke was first released in 1692, but later was released during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windbreaks were cut and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was unsealed.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops encamped in the vicinity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke the chancel and church chairs and used them as a firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to overthrow in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger's Helarius Cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche is broken.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of 1834, a storm flushed the bell tower and half a storm.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the Turmzwerg still existing today was the witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallenberg and Rolf-Dieter Wem maintain the "Schaffhauser penders" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant.</seg>

<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (International Settinalverket) started with the implementation of the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish migration Authority (Migrationsverket) for mistakes during the assessment of the correct age of some refugees was criticized.</seg>
<seg id="887">Until today, Migrationsverket 6.880 sends to testant cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.</seg>

<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "possibly under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests will only be conducted in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, in his first working day with leading employees, he set a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information that are in the hands of the president.</seg>

<seg id="1397">President Trumps regarding television runs decades - and now, where he is in the White House, its TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Candidate has failed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs," "" "said the former electoral advisor Sam Nunberg in February compared to POLITICO." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter habit is under control, according to six former election campaign civil servants, to ensure that its personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something, what we don't know - that Trumps Tweet would have any more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets, the trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees manage it already several times, practicing him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevent it, that trump controversies are caused.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House, which are composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Material, which may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - something busy with this history - reported in May on the preference of consultants, dubious President of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former tachuting officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he has stiffened to it, where these originate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody accused the president of the Internet-Provocateur, Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banned from Twitter, or that he had not offered a concrete evidence, or that he expresses false accusations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask people to ask about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper tray."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried to do three months later, the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove itself as Priebus as Priebus, but trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still looking for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1535">The melt of Shelmelt and Eisberg increases the sea level, as they swim on the water and swift as much water as it yields the melt.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the snib leads that glaciers can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, however only in a small size, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institution CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence was effectively endangered because the plant has been suspended over the past few years, which has much less rain in spring and in autumn much more.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually come on Wednesdays to check their plans for the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unstoppable drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what safer: they are supposed to take their children with the office, which were the goal of an attack with Grands, or leave them at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, ally, ally.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter, to suggest the name for every column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartridge, a catalogue of crime that make chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no quiet break of violence, and throughout the country, there are more journalists there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 have been standing in attacks and threats under federal guard and by now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their publishers and her Inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez, Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez, wrote in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is deeply perceived, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle-finger with the word "Justice," by Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-shirts, that show the smiling face with glasses or its typical panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their divided themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special edition of the Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010, it was initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organizational crime, the murderers of journalists are only rare from court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are ironically, and although the terrain is still tragic now.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without Justice, the meeting has little benefits to the discussion of security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to turn my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why we don't miss it all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the Newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men, and was shot at him for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which was translated with "12th River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter went away in his car and damaged it close.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing than silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlefield of the country, as riveting fractions started to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It turns nothing to be shot in Sinaloa every day or several people on the road, or that the cemetery is full of galvanized, two-storey Mausoleen for drug may be bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "for a minute that there is a state of" "" "quiet" "" "if only a chair is the control of coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February, in February, the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalizing cartons in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may denied the sons, the voter turnout bought each copy of the issue as soon as they delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error occurred in the Valdez, nor force Valdez, following the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country to his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survives that his friends and colleagues draw up that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, joined the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without annoying the space-poison problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the newspaper used a reputation for courageous and honorable reporting, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to publish hard tread investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, nobody else had to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce it received the prestigious "Mary-Moors Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntarily to that he had afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done?" "" "why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He always would go to El Guayabo, the bar, opposite the office and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Then ask them: was his love for the routine?</seg>

<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>

<seg id="1871">Outside, there are two policemen protection against the heat from 104 ° C (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the regional government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in Culiacan district of central Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joking, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who were not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drugs are facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has led out three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former renowned boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the State spending, focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was kidnapped, or how it happened, so was caution that everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite local drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">Reporters from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a Politician, which heard the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who ruled the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locomotive, including one, in which a son of "El Chapo" went into a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers wanted to describe the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage compartment for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murders of journalists, because the employees had become something that they had never expected: activists in the press-name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez laminated a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning after a further journalist for the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western part Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and civil servants say that it is based on DNA tests.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists became loud, by organizing themselves in organized protests "SOS Press" on enclosures and builders.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez was gone into Washington and tries to collect international support for judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to send out journalists and said they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has since then asked that she is assured by the government, because she worried that their rage has injured their objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant stress is covered, although it is covered with a armor, and resembles a shifting tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from space and used a shielding technology which is known as counterparts, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to soak his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now able to see at Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and studied at Boreopelta brandmitchelli after the museum engineers Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours, it has been carefully to cover it.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the convoy, a widespread defence method in animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature darker was less than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the convocation is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Boreopelta is far from far the animals live today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that dinosaurs has had enough pressure due to the carnivorous dinosaurs. the evolution is favorable to the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the countershady approach - think of Rehe, Zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and injurious than prey, what's signalling that this nodossier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1950">They believe that dinosaurs died when he died, was driven into a river and driven into the sea, where he sank into the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two on the next morning will drive to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11.</seg>

<seg id="2047">You have to know it and it must be seen and moved in it.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became an old camp as the activists on the possible Non-indictment of Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags, add them to protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met in the evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came by Ferrell in the sense: "you want to document or tries to find a story that you can use?"</seg>

<seg id="2063">Folayan already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around death-occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browns.</seg>

<seg id="2068">Consequently, the documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells lives, as she loves and married her woman.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when they saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells is repeated the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement which influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012 following the killing of the black teenager carrying out the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "magnitude": TV-reader discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves the people, although they are not yet built long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic can hardly be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While playing a bit-gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "this would be real class" (Nicole swing), comes from the other side: "does not need a human being" (Siggi Baking) or simply: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates had to build a gallery more customers in the city, of which the remaining shops take advantage of the fact that the pedestrian zone collapse.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be planned exactly on the premises, on which the market market stands in which 13 direct products offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building, namely the Beda-Platz, with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady again very much gladly.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have discovered the butcher too for us.</seg>

<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping mates in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, driners or supermarkets, I find it superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Of course there is enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many stores are empty, some have been empty for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is so important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For all, the goods offered is fresh, mostly offered directly by producer, is obscendously inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores are rented in a shopping center only from larger companies, because there are often not tragic for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Shame, special stores there are almost no more, and what else is left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit for Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the farmers market during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - also in duration if the bit-gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or will it already make the ghostst bit-gallery previously, all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's easy to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty, nobody needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">With my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farm market, there is no more space thanks to the awful many - how I find - sensual construction projects in Bitburg is no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market is broken down, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the center of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost inattentive - to hang in cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuplights and hair cuts created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyzer has banned a 35-year prison sentence after having publicly traded diplomatic messages over the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline is based in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA which could look and out of the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data could not only be considered with these genomic data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but since her puberty has been openly spoken over the identification as a woman, in 2013, among them six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, their image expresses her, so much that there was only one grain, black-white Selfie, located in the Manning, arguably sits on a driver's seat and a platinum blonde Persian is associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strangers of forensic artifacts such as cigarette silent and chewing gum by removing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of which people could look like this.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And it could not be visited at that time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse were confiscated with brimunden, which intertwined several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic Comic "Suppliers Images," which was a future forecasted, in which President chelated judgment would change, and it was able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama really was only few days after the book was released, Mannings released after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep in the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, as Donald Trump leads an war against informants from government camps and against Transgender troops to find new, tweeable ways to resolve the rigid divisions, which he should actually resolve to deflaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">As Dewey-Hagborg, after the weird timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a specific reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one of the artistic statement, Manning, with their oversized signature ("i" in her family name is provided with a heart) at the end of "automatic attribution, whose foundation is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - an thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, in a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological aspects, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people hopefully take part, our genome is not, who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece of this exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, like playing with a hands-on-hand side from the disciplinary federation of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if your words are cold, then they have won," "" "says it." ""</seg>

<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys from certain teams, it features a heat-card of the company, which shows that units have most complaints and which managers can provide low additives results - so that you can drill down, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to view that at the top of the workplace culture, so that you do not have the next Uber, which has been involved in scandals since then, a former employee of a blog post, which describes a field of harassessments, where those who have spoken, punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish for an overview of a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion, according to the financing technical website let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and identify bad conduct, looking at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">He has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent companies offer customized "pulse" surveys, reliable responses in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS-hotline, which can be reported to the employee's specific behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the principal managing director are involved, complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of Public Opinion has captured the Regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that its staff is poorly treated or inethically, it can experience precious consequences due to consumers-boycott, workers-flux and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has paid Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel that said, there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company Convercent insists, problems previously were identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unsofter intern - can be addressed and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can come closer to these holistic, 360-degree view in the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies started to take Ethics, Values and Employees in 2002 after the publishing company Arthur Andersen conducted for ethical violations of the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint as well as Convercent offer your software as service, and buttons the company with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that takes the approval of Venture Capital Investors who both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million at the financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzinger secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>

<seg id="2239">"" "" "" "there is a growing complex of research, which shows that today's employees expect more than before." ""</seg>
<seg id="2240">High salaries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects.</seg>

<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools are promise to increase commitment and deployment of employees, it's no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on the employee's commitment to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of an enterprise does not attack measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks for your feedback, it may have a expectation that is changing to the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change isn't fast enough, or not at all, this is disappointing and employees demotivate.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4.000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company to rely on the collecting of data.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that there will not be crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments within the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of FRR, we must begin to take it seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more common," "" "said Mr Sharon in the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon, which feels warm, with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust its robot according to his beliefs "and choose everything from the eye-color of the robot about the form of nipples by type or the color of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will still be worrying, as many robots have the "Personalities" that would look progressive-woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to customize their robot to the properties, as well as student mobility.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the True Companion Cxxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relying and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>

<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many beatiful aspects of this scension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but undertaking a step on Frigid (called here: irregulating) Farrah is going to uncalm a most.</seg>

<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "when women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" "" "is it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a feeling or simply just another sexual plane.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement indicate a slightly darker and deeper understanding in our culture, on a retreat from the Ideal of Gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally do no sex robots, and while FRR anticipates their rising popularity, they still remain preliminarily on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeates out of the boundary zones, can be found in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>

<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the Injection of Healthy Human Rights</seg>
<seg id="2426">It became a Binsensuishness of the trump-era that the political divisions have polarized the US-voters, which have divided families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankle there was in the U.S. newspapers with advice about how to choose from the horror of bump-selectable relations.</seg>

<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-directed tilitter, who lives in Chicago, and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family, who has visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me that the unit can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House, everyone knows them, including the republican relationship, with which she had fought for decades of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this certainly is a good cause, but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The Left was strengthened by Trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the gruselly possibility that his kittens cannot be thrust anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, a frightful long-term scenario, in the Trump Republican of the right wing "normalized," which suddenly appear to appear in comparison to his standards as inception of generosity.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find me nowadays by active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of declining - the dog on the Autodach, who saw 14% income tax (but at least we did, like his tax returns) - both in comparison to trump in fact occur as a very mild Strawling.</seg>

<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm not all over the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience, as there are two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I would have been able to rate the carousel, I would have given him full score, but fortunately nobody asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims that the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could cause symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes stomach ulsions and paralysis, recurring or bloody crashes, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the sufferers usually come to avoid meat and milk products, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells, which promote tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immunocells at the Darm patrol to ensure that harmful microbes to hide themselves in food, do not penetrate in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are able to resolve inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is inclined towards inflammation, it can result in an anti-inflammatory disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In Experiments, it was determined that a sort of tolerance-promoting immune cell in mice, which contribute to a certain bacterium in its bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan mice had their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an important tryptophan diet tolerant, less inflammatory bowel-lieus encourages the same system even in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral degree in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan wrote a kind of immune cell which had found tolerance as it was found that a group of study mice had such cells, but it was isolated, but that was not isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It suspected that the difference between the intestinal microbious mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi usually live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice have been DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but lacked mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were disastered in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal microbiome was not developed and they were not developed by L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria results in the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri to grow in a fluid and then carried small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unmature immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleansed from the fluid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism that is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, increasing the number of such cells by around 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us can protect L. reuteri in our gastro-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known as Tryptophan products from L. reuteri to develop cells in people like in mice, but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">The potential, high-yptophan values of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain won't leave in its persecution by Neymar after they had an offer of £189 million to dissolve his freotal island, but did Barcelona warned over the world three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has been heated in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than doubled the previous brand, with Paul Pogba in the past season for 89 million pounds worth Manchester United.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the highest paid professional athletes born in the world. PSG provides wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is angry with the way that Neymar has forced his way to the outside of the Catalans-Management, although the club has always given its existence since its arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of him.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned over three years ago from the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City was interested in Blaise Matuidi's interest in the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each association to sign one of the best player from PSG.</seg>

<seg id="2874">This line seems to have crossed this line with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG clearly made that they could not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interesses by losing their prices for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen Report on the abuse of abstained by Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the Missing andal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to discuss discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisner, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are Church," explained according to the publication of the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domenvoy Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would very serve the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deependuring their own submissions or their then wrong assessment of operations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Chancellor" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that against violence at Domspatzen (" "" "two measures" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the convictions in Regensburg, no one would have to be prevented for "shameful and shameful deeds" handle, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit, the Catholic Church, as a source of all evil experience, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also intercede Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk," "" "you will be happy to go on the church and this is a little faint Fressen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, it pointed out that in her youth, "beats have been quite normal" pedagogical means "to be done," to be done with naughty children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They fires unfair, today's standards for earlier decades, because the world changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope Georg Ratzinger frequently appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who written with Ratzinger the" "" "My Brother of Pope" "" "written in 12 languages." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "said Hesemann," "" "For all this had nothing to do with him," "" "evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented to the German diocese of Regensburg by the Enlightenment, lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 regensburger Domspatzen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "summarize that by Domkapellmeister R. were applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for pupils could also be severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other certifications, many victims fell by R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are linked with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the Missing scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger behind his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violation of Violation at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for an lifting many students of his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">In addition, it appears as chanceric and perfectionist, one of the Öfteren, when a Domspatz made no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and reads all 440 pages long report from the front till the back, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is just eight pages dedicated and it will be cleared from any suspicion of the middle or co-witness with the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The force of violence on the pre-school happened outside of its active sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can disclose him if it's too late or first clarifications do not have taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents - as literally - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent witness," "" "popular" "", "" "", "" "" "correctly" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "," "" "," "" "," "" "," "" "," "" "," "" "," "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "" and "always" "", "" "", "" "" and always be surrounded by grapes of children. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is committed to its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to anger quarries.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only threw those with chairs and laid the keys on the ground, but also earmured boys in the hair or ears, he has abandoned himself, deeply regreening, and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his honour, however, such corrective methods in fragmenting time, the 1960s and 1970s were widespread, with parents like in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I've also experienced that in a secular school, a state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to that, in fact, in this report, it goes in this report, namely the abnormality of sexual abuse and violence at pre-school, the liberated Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then you can't ask if it did not think to do with his acquaintance and his role as brother by Benedikt XVI., that many media overthrew him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many who never have understood him, still eagerly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the context, a lot about the subject of abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen plant was reported in connection with this report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger become at the final report also in regard to sexual abuse during the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual grips claims to have entrusted to the cathedral-kapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never geted me to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said a affected representative for the others," "" "There was everything very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in the clarification of sexual abuse has been, however, most victims of jackals are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't listen to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral conductor, who would have been working as a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "concerning sexual abuse..." "" "I don't see..." "" "in regard to sexual abuse..." "" "(Georg Ratzinger) could have had a timely findings and could have the respective offender." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, to accept that... Bubbles have urgent or clearer or even more, than against their parents, Internatsconductors, confidentiality instructors etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report on the very clear result:" "" "that in advance, the pupils and / or their surroundings could not be entrusted to him in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free of all fellow citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be accused of having taken him or brought him not.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring its good name with these contradictory crimes, as it was unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "violence to be read" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former cathedral-master Georg Ratzinger is accused of the "Path" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this cast?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "this is the great problem that in the reporting is mixed and menstrued anything from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2949">However, exactly this is an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is so clean: between the preschool and the school of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report deals with events from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger isn't the Chorus of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible pedagogy pedagogy, cases in which the boys suffered from sadistical teachers, and of them suffered tremendously, occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Domspengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In fact, as the most witnesses believed, the theme "preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to come and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "parental" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "there was discipline in discipline, but no sadisches violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at the conclusion of the report that" "" "many victims" "" "fell by R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the moment, most of the preachute have to be moved away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods, in which it was reported by the conditions at pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and took part in a school, at which he was not working and responsible, (so the Witness) wanted nothing to hear and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger shut down the ears before the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspengymnasium, which was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "it shows that," "" "I will continue to practice the test penalty" "" "in the preschool." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative presuals, he received urgent advising.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was not banned in Bavaria, even in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, they happened in a legal auauzone, as everyone knows we know.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate him, where the sufferers may have been exaggerated or dramatically, where the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">You can't say, but he would have always stowed away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test sentence of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"" "" "" "Füry Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed" "" "it was not fair to apply today's pedagogical standards to time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "we orians talking about" "" "parachack of Anachronism" "", "thus the Danger, last to today's moral." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true for sexual abuse, which was abominable to all times, and not for what happened in preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's camps, which goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all terrible and I'm glad that it is finally ascended.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for discipline and punishment, so ear parties and ears to draw, were widespread far in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also kept strictly confidential.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture from his Regensburger Period, Georg Ratzinger played in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of Pope?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of testing also to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, the cathedral sparrows played only one side.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I lost no means that it led a stringent regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said once: without these perfectionism, without having unquestionably unconditionally known regensburger Domspatzen, it would probably have been possible to form a nation-known regensburger Domspatzen (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone there is no big singers but in front of every success, equal to what area, still discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What people have you experienced for George Ratzinger in the conversations regarding their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I've experienced Georg Ratzinger really very well and always experienced as wonderful, humorous, deep-hearted, deeply glamorous and hearted people, from which one can't imagine, that he could do just a fly something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">"" "" "" "I regularly receive with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his embarking, regularly visit him to visit him - he's almost blindly - and how to treat him as a member of her family." ""</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who didn't forgive him until today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are today grateful for him to enriches their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict Father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectorson, to which they still watch and honour it.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, once again, clearly: everything that accuses to him are corrective methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it's very unfair, a man, only because he was prominently and has a prominent brother to make medial sinks.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Since is the evil intention that behind it is only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just released, was relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the applicant would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and probably no one without the Regensburger Domspatzen (Germany) would finally know in peace.</seg>
