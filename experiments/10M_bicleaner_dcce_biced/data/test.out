Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I will always be attached in drawers
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on doesn &apos;t have to be perfect or successful .
this was clearly mis@@ understand@@ able in an interview with Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; I always plug@@ ged in drawers or can be glu@@ ed from the outside label which have usually little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only lau@@ gh that they are known as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as described in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
preferably , the act@@ ress del@@ ights her time at home , in front of TV with lo@@ cker@@ ish D@@ ut@@ t and Mexico &apos;s food , it is called in the magazine .

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the p@@ ile pyramid
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
at the end of a Gol@@ ft@@ ur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variety of variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes , the horses had remembered their celebrations , they said in fast gal@@ lo@@ ping home to the feed .
a kilometer during this temp@@ o , I had to be afraid .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the equ@@ est@@ rian guitarist also ended again .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
with his family , he left the AL@@ RV on the line of the AL@@ RV on a horse . he could not have a photo shoot .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe presented the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala , the Golden Sport pyramid .
it does not lack the lik@@ able athletes .
Federal Minister of Transport , Silver Lor@@ be@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ owed him .
long winner is the 18 pri@@ ze@@ winner of the pyramid of pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this distinction means a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for spor@@ tive achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
since decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of EUR 25,000 .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ point prize winner was captured on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ck and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ eng , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , who is mar@@ vell@@ ous and pos@@ thum@@ ously of the hand@@ bo@@ b@@ aller Erhard .
many of these sports enthusiasts were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ate company emigrated to the stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za @-@ Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept spac@@ ing to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy compared to IT &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreements - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are , however , in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep the dou@@ b@@ ts more small and war@@ ned , as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation .
Clinton wants to climb the economy and regul@@ ate death , he says .
in contrast , he would be quite different , claims t@@ ump .
he will establish regulations mas@@ sively , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for individuals and businesses .
Clinton says : the state has established particular tasks to open the dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes for friction would therefore increase , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
to be invested in the m@@ ills , tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ t@@ ently .
the democratic applicant in announces even the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the nation@@ alist Te@@ w@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so , at tr@@ ump , you could get @-@ in @-@ internal discussions .
clearly the differences in the energy and climate policies are evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and again driving coal mining in the USA .
oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris@@ ian climate agreement wants to announce it .
Clinton &apos;s investment programme aims to expand and demands renewable energy in their investment programme : &quot; a country becomes the super@@ power of clean energy and creating millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I don &apos;t want it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even for international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the body @-@ fish trade agreement , both don &apos;t want to sign .
at the same time , both don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but just keep American jobs better .
the should then be paid better , calls for about Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger @-@ wages .
she wants to raise him up to $ 15 per hour .
what is going to do in this question is not clear : once he says , the minimum wage must arise , then he says he shall not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
at one side , tr@@ ump , which wants to re@@ lie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critic adher@@ es to him , that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton Hill , who wants to pay more taxes , and their critics saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more taxes are also not the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
escape : &quot; every cre@@ ted woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women sitting .
each one has a baby which is a year old .
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he gu@@ sts with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table top .
until she noticed that she is ob@@ serving .
she sm@@ iles short and k@@ issed the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social support in Bavaria , focuses on women with the theme of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alized accommodations for temporary women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs stopped the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munich &apos;s help .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men no - do not exist - even as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man ahead of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who comes here , has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee to wars because they are politically persec@@ uted , because their families are threatened or death , because their families send them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ers to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many are secret@@ ly ste@@ amed of it , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , honor , slavery or for@@ given birth .
it is driving them away .
on the run this continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ g for example for a bottle of water is a sexual action , no r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they live in Germany , ir@@ re , tells truth .
even here , women in refugee advice would be regarded as inf@@ erior and worst if used .
this leads to that about 90 per cent of women who live in the North of Munich , are traum@@ ati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are as usual , that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t believe , openly about the living , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because they often don &apos;t need to help others , there are more properties only for them , calling B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria seven governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether they w@@ anting from a similar project like in Munich in its authority of jurisdiction , some respon@@ ds with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ al@@ z and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are some places in the governments of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben , women alone are not divided against women , &quot; says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ es of the Government .
in the Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are available in some common sub @-@ shel@@ ters or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study that was published for the Committee , it says , &quot; It &apos;s very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will be accommod@@ ated together , women and women can come to - for@@ nic@@ ation - violence against women &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women of this protection experience can be seen at the con@@ ges@@ tion , giving it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been dealing with us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily stop a second house .
Regist@@ rar : demands according to new labour measures
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) asked his entire advice to appro@@ ve more work measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that there was Minister of Minister , to worry about the concerns regarding the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assist@@ ants and medical studies have agreed upon the re@@ jection of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who have voted in the elections .
in a letter to members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained peaceful &quot; to problems that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC member voted to fully re@@ ject the proposed new contract and to be wor@@ ried about official new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC member states today a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of employment creating measures in early September .
the disputes led to this year , that assist@@ ing in this year , the first complete incid@@ ents in the history of N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A Assist@@ enz@@ y Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election to re@@ jection of the agreed contractual conditions that were advised by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants and medical studies , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health said Jerem@@ y Hunt that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was an gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and proc@@ laim the official end of the words and economic sanctions during the end of eight months .
but as Vladimir Putin won his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded Hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in a gil@@ ded room , I can &apos;t protect myself from pressure , that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation .
there was the envelope , yes .
but Put@@ ting smile worked dirty and he radi@@ ated hardly warmth , even for its rest@@ ra@@ ined circumstances .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , spoke about his &quot; loving friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could not count anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to its old level before the crisis , but even further improve .
next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have thought that Erd@@ og@@ an would never happen .
I seemed to suggest my enthusiasm to the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustained , showed that Russia &apos;s state of Russia had nothing .
rather , the cause of crisis has been the first thing which he mentioned in his introductory statement : the shooting of a Russian fight aircraft on Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin distributed and accused Ankara to please the back in Russia .
leaving was even bigger , as it was committed by a supp@@ er friend .
the Vet@@ rau@@ en will re@@ build up again , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a fier@@ y , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed as would carry the Turks to bl@@ ame for everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the serious adverse officials , Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the president Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s exc@@ use , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind win .
for Ankara , the advantages of an ar@@ mis@@ tice is clear in hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is primarily all the friends who he can get from a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat that he had failed during the last month .
he repeated terror attacks on Turkey .
but there are also economic motifs .
Russian sanctions strongly met Turkey - especially the ban of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they belong to the Mediterranean Sea on a late afternoon .
this week , the public TV set aside fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports will be allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is w@@ oun@@ ding to the West since its reaction to the tried feasi@@ bility was considered a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this , the sustained impact on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ v@@ et@@ ousness is to move from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian leader won a claim that he asked for the elected coup d &quot; é@@ tat of support for the chosen state of state .
that &apos;s well @-@ established for Moscow , self @-@ intellig@@ ibility , which himself has a deep fear of ra@@ iment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this beautiful Palace on the sea allowed it Russia and Turkey , as it once described a analy@@ st , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allianz from outside the side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries that stum@@ ble from the west and are po@@ or@@ ly treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as peace sti@@ ckers , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual pages .
it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial talks both pre@@ sidents appear on the press conference that they would not have been stri@@ ped .
the president of Turkey canc@@ elled it clearly on a question about their differences , while Putin was decided to emphasi@@ ze this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in view of the potenti@@ als for a perfect disp@@ at@@ ement , as the NATO member turns Turkey &apos;s mar@@ tial mar@@ tial , it is certainly better that the two heads of heads speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that R@@ BS brand has joined the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has gone down since then , when they had almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
in this time , brand str@@ at@@ egen &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumers .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds , sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Rug@@ by up to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now it has decided to rever@@ t more national brands in focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is available only for customers in Scotland , but will not initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B testi@@ moni@@ als , the dec@@ entr@@ alized headquarters and the stock market will switch to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private clients that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be part of our Invest@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the brand that will be employ@@ ing our staff , since we are now more about a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has been introduced to the global brand .
I say now that we don &apos;t pursue global goals , but local targets .
each of these brands will be completely different for something completely different and our employees work among those brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing will no longer be continued and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop for the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked you ) to make this a better bench for customers ? &quot; said the board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago it would have been very angry when we had said that we have launched a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come .

I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
there is no big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - there is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am facilit@@ ated and very mo@@ dest@@ ly .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the le@@ ver when he wins the victory at Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; &quot; &quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s have reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record career . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey world &apos;s best , and it is no surprise that he achieved this milestone in just a few years ago .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical int@@ ell@@ ect that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma has been thr@@ illed fans for years for this sport .

three years ago , he had first encounter@@ ed difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his branches and to return to his efforts .
and he is not yet a long time at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier once he wants to continue in competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ age of life .
Russia &apos;s Putin mo@@ ist Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
the Russian President Vladimir Putin did not expect his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the close trust of Putin &apos;s trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed a special representative for environmental and transport matters .
in an opinion of Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged Putin without st@@ ating reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered by his duties as chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ ary office . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a deputy chairman since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he graduated in the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later becoming a protocol director and director of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of government to support their activity as head of law and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared Russian TV broadcast@@ ed on Friday with IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V asked that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made mysteri@@ ously .
Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time one of the most eng@@ ined confidentiality Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , it was broadcast@@ ed on TV , both males claimed that the Chief of Staff has with@@ drawn at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , there are only few of them - especially ahead of the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power ?
nobody is nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once appeared as potential president , who wants to forward Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to large sk@@ ep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin , quoted on the Website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you to trust in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - it could almost say - compl@@ aining in four years .
as it asks , I have been chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ ary for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , as Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , the K@@ GB was appointed to his deputy .
as Putin was going to power to power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people , whom he trusted in most .
it was assum@@ ing that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V could be President of Russia &apos;s second term of office , as a third term of Putin would have lost its constitution against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally &apos;s allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Minister @-@ President before he was again president of the President three and a half years later .

puzzles for fish , who landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff ur@@ ged by the identification of the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain think that there could act at the 75 f@@ ishes around Sand@@ als , which were captured by a fountain .

Queens@@ Ferry Crossing : bridge next to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the North deck of the Queens@@ ski Cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - what does the bridge have to be connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four sealing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is finished for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 shaft parts .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
the construction site Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ ski Empire .
we are all witnesses of a tru@@ ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a native activity which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of total mos@@ quito l@@ acks at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to his place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , Project Leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a considerable milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the sh@@ utter forward @-@ looking high @-@ quality and civil engineering .
after installing the last street section and its connection with the North tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap close to the North or country .
this was achieved by pulling the northern Zub@@ ring@@ er@@ brücke 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive , and at the same time very hei@@ k@@ le activity .
mas@@ sively , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled from a gradient of about 3 % upwards .
hei@@ gh@@ le , as the tolerances , on which the team works , tiny - on each side they were only bet@@ rot@@ ated only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot;
three men still have &quot; happiness still on life , &quot; after having been thrown by their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station was on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert , after an crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swi@@ m security , while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned in close to itself and set us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said head of the rescue station from Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds b@@ aked the boat apart from its range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a boat hanging without life@@ jacket .
they came all aboard the coast @-@ rescue training and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who have been thrown into the waters were lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot engine had an emergency stop , however , this dissolved , however , when the boat controlled by the person who controlled the boat .
today someone has weigh@@ ted over these men .
bad@@ ly viol@@ ated - man handle on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police had split yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had to get the key to get his personal things .
instead of the alcoholic do@@ ers the clothing of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when they came into the apartment , he st@@ oned twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and on the body .
the police could take the off@@ ender .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ ar@@ ming then his sister .
together with their lives , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but you could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her habitat out of the house .
on the road , they met the ex @-@ life end@@ anger of the man .
when the two women ro@@ asted the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got his sister to the side and attacked her ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds Braunschweig budget apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green : investors shall be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is it respon@@ ding to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD also suggests a &quot; action concept living &quot; to the next rating .
yet argument is programmed .
first line is about the question : who should actually build the favorable apartments ?
a control is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD @-@ president Christoph Viola believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are proud to build us with the green : those who want to build urban areas in the future 20 percent of all apartments as well as social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable apartments can also be found in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great conflict in the town hall is , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you want to build investors , who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at least 10 per cent , but as possible 20 per cent of the apartments as social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal residential construction program , which will cost millions , will have to be financed and will provide incen@@ tives for incen@@ tives .
the problem , as Viola : &quot; there is currently no agreement between frac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left still wants hardness levels for investors .
despite whose , br@@ mann , b@@ ah@@ ne establishes a dis@@ appearance of the situation on the housing market .
the action concept will be implemented , which ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it is unc@@ le@@ ar if we get the skilled workers .
but the program doesn &apos;t stand completely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be arranged anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 favourable apartments , whose promotion is going out in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the planning @-@ planning speaker Nicole Palm , should now be bought out by the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about to retri@@ eve apartments again into the price binding .
this is possible in the western town .
the problem can be solved on a blow .
because in the West @-@ city walk the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could get there back in price binding for cheap homes .
only : those who do not want the owners , which do not belong to houses .
because the number of social dwellings in the western town is dras@@ tically increased , from the aim of the so @-@ called re@@ mix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social gu@@ ards in just a few districts of the town shall not be more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens therefore expect that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CDU must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is focused on more buildings for one @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean , however , that not even a compromise could be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it is fascinating , how the world is changing .
that teenagers and child can &apos;t go without outdoors , but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens up for rigid , was su@@ ed in the last decade of many cases .
with Po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go , it is therefore about to get people from the sofa and to be active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last limited to smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and activities are not inter@@ connecting to each other .
I am looking forward to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app that is based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it emerged from a cartoon @-@ series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank during the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smartphones go outside and looking for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS , once they were found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( on a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the guard and sp@@ rang up for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which reduces the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
cardio , an app for Apple Watch , which followed up for 35@@ ,000 users , followed by Washington Post , announced that within two days after the market launch of the game , the number of followed people train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it simply looks the raw data for performance improvement .
many public awareness campaigns for health , people who want to bring about 30 minutes to take away , &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; and &quot; every day they &apos;re working on de@@ af ears , because many public messages are bor@@ ing to health and come from people who look forward .
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be evaluated .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances to climb from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of advantages , which is too long to conduct them here .
but the wonderful to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , making them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people even join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always , there are also wor@@ sen@@ ic toys which must always be surprised .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even when phone apps like Fit@@ bit could follow earlier our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new one will lose his maturity and use it with time .
due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , more games will be combined to combine apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world , and so many people will be helping the hunt to be active , itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the immune system .
dynam@@ ically on the jump @-@ horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
for full line brilliant .
and now Olympic champion is finally available .
19 @-@ year old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi @-@ championship titles and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly seen in front of silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; teams in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze medal winner in Ali@@ ya Must@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ f at the Swedish bal@@ let for women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ championship title , and a total of the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of its generation or even ever .
she broke in t@@ ears when her end result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
this success set them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world @-@ medals , including 10 gold medals , which includes a mixture of ambi@@ tion and precision , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Ret@@ ton said that she ever saw &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was an last examination in Brazil , a contest , which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather , between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the American singers Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man sur@@ t@@ ted after they have won gold and silver in the single competition of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es picked up the first Medal on Tuesday , while she retired at the f@@ are@@ well celebration , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi minist@@ ered in retirement .
although Bil@@ es existed , during their long way to the top , never planned the future , it &apos;s not really true .
part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would take home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl which was adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man .
she has lost no multi @-@ competition competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning stre@@ ak , which is as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ ina was slightly led by two rotary switches , the image over@@ looked .
Sweden and Bo@@ dies - in which Bil@@ es holds the world champion title - l@@ ur@@ ry .
she resum@@ ed again with 15,@@ 433 on the Swedish bal@@ let and set a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man h@@ ug@@ ged it gently when they expected their final form - a pure form - and t@@ ears @-@ po@@ inter on Bil@@ es glossy red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision , which it once described in their collection book , to reality .
the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a depth of Must@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man cap@@ aci@@ ers , who is called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after her ground exercise , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes was dou@@ bt@@ ful .
so what is concerned , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old , has a very new significance for the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims of mass mur@@ der@@ ers in the car shot in the car
according to police reports , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were killed , who had been killed in one of the most fatal attacks since one decade in the first series of mass mur@@ der@@ fall by Phoenix , when they list@@ ened to the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were killed on the 12th of June , while the car was par@@ ked in a passage , by the authorities .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand feu@@ dal weapon while it stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled to another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police dealt with that the triple murder could not have been the result of a prey , since the attack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took possession of an adult victim .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ ers of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting down has led the investig@@ ator to get a closer look at which it is connected with four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed in h@@ isp@@ anic residential neighbor@@ hoods in nine months in nine months and two others were injured .
&quot; it is in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to off@@ end the evidence that they were linked to the conclusion that they were associated with the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for it to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities , also published a police report on the shooting , which was imposed on an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the plant of the mass mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing and toys , toys and mother .
but like the least of his anti@@ quity , Edmund Mikro@@ co@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , knew the result of his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought I was not .
I don &apos;t manage this .
I didn &apos;t let it om@@ itted .
what &apos;s not correct -- of course , one has left to it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund she never may know them under circumstances , and that he may not survive once .
some doctors actually went so far that they beat him to institutional .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a secret aid .
Edmund could not sit at the age of his third life , neither would he still talk about it .
but he makes slowly progress .
he can run and cycling with support .
he also loves it to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth is showing the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please give me something about &quot; thought out . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring a drawing language with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is no typical drawing language -- says she . Edmund has invented a number of characters alone .
micro recipe has a variety of causes : genetic as for Edmund as well as infections with viruses like meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how to influence life with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus in@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an uncer@@ tain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t really know .
I &apos;ve been looking for a long time since long time , because I &apos;m not waiting that someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , floods gives reason to rescue in Louis@@ iana , Mississippi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana is forced to call the governor , on Friday the emergency stand . it will be counted throughout the entire Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Mississippi River floo@@ ded their banks and dro@@ pl@@ ets with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Louis@@ iana John Bel Edwards told us that state officials are standing in constant contact with local authorities and help the municipalities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the governor , told that the en@@ quiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags .
ste@@ els said that alone , the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used for widespread parts in southern Louis@@ i@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided an additional 3 to 5 inch of rain in this area .
in the South Al@@ ab@@ sent a flush system was deployed on Friday , while it continues to reign in the mobile region .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , will reach all probability of breaking record levels .
the met@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ fluctu@@ ate many houses in the subur@@ b of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that an alternating @-@ back@@ ward floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these are slowly flowing through the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the ticket ti@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level , ever recorded at 0@@ 9.00 .
rescue teams are still people from the floo@@ ding in the Americas of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the Sou@@ thwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Han@@ s@@ ford , his wife and his wife , were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Han@@ s@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from its house , rose heavily on night .
he said that it had been another step@@ son , who lives in the vicinity of lives , war@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are asc@@ ended and pulled in the water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Han@@ s@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Han@@ s@@ ford , in whom they lived there in the 48 years , in which they had never seen such a flood of the river .
Han@@ s@@ ford said that he , and his family members would have had all the disabilities , and he was the only one who can swi@@ m .
Han@@ s@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer said all three in a great military @-@ truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , since it continued heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , and that the authorities engage in ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a ob@@ servers close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13,@@ 75 inches rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground had been significantly full of ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities proved that heavy ra@@ ins and road floo@@ ding people out of their houses are caused by their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and schol@@ ar in five districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a sub@@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had over 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both were floo@@ ded now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven domestic animals , which were r@@ ushed by the floods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency houses were furnished to accommodate ev@@ acu@@ ated .
&quot; once the water starts to come back , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads are closed due to high water and sandy beach for residents who hope the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood which we had , was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in Mississippi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it continues to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his details , a hand@@ ful of houses have been reported to be reported on Thursday , but they were not reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police divide that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is poured out .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia than Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents indicated that Brown suffered several sn@@ uss@@ ing violations , including in the L@@ ende , B@@ one , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was with consciousness in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has made a lot of pier@@ ced his small body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boys of the boys were classified as critical in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys told the broad@@ caster that he is expected to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were killed in German@@ town .
there were also three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old boy .
one of the 29 @-@ year old men is in the critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who found itself in a critical condition , reported on the transmitter .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I found under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ning Observatory , which consists of more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been at any summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA never became dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who insp@@ ir@@ ational for many young girls .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Kath@@ oli@@ kin is round , everyone &apos;s proud .
this team is finally reflected in the United States .
it has consolidated the black and Hisp@@ anic female presence at the top of these sports art .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
over the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympics winner and in America .
now the world was able to be the incredible performance of the three @-@ time world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , but most hon@@ orable Gy@@ mas@@ tic routines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual meeting event for women .
man member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of these sporting art , but they do not see turn@@ around in the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck them all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic Championships will have four gymn@@ as@@ ers in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi is a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like that there are a expensive sport and Turner at first line in private gy@@ ms , which are maintained by parents for training , training , travel , travel and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and families ) . the list can be continued in any time .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that support business .
in these societies , Turner will receive its total training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since then starting with the Tur@@ ning .
we have to be inspired by the communities of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an efficient and easy @-@ to @-@ access gy@@ ms .
I founded my Turn@@ Foundation for 20 years .
we have free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September , we are expanding to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth of high quality tiles that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sports .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and education and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this squ@@ ad , the thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison , for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by bringing together so many young girls with different background to begin their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
Assist@@ enz@@ y want to organize more strikes after Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal rejected
the ministers had hop@@ ing to end the dispute over the changes due to adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ .000 Regist@@ rar , who voted upon a vote , refused .
in July , Hunt &apos;s plans have revealed that the N@@ HS advertis@@ ed and said that N@@ HS would be dealing in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients were harmful .
the first assist@@ ants are to receive a new contract , which contains amendments to night and weekend , to improve care of un@@ likely times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Commission for Assist@@ enz@@ sts gave birth to the proposed Treaty : &quot; assist@@ ances in particular , in particular that it is pre@@ h@@ ust@@ omed to pre@@ heat the current staff of staff and to deal all doctors . &quot;
in only eight weeks , the first group of doctors remain under the new contract must be made adv@@ ances , and the time runs out .
efforts from the BM@@ A to solve disputes within the government strug@@ gl@@ ed with regard to counter@@ s and sometimes di@@ min@@ ating silence .
that was what happened to Jerem@@ y Hunt for the last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act to raise up the vibration and speak the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ence . &quot;
if he do not do this , the assist@@ ants have made appreci@@ able that they are ready to perform other workers .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since n@@ urses and professionals were included in order to grant doctors on strike postoperative cover .
the ministers had hop@@ ing to end the dispute over the changes due to an acceptance of the reform contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ day re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 Regist@@ rar , which are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , demanded the assist@@ ants to end strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers do not achieve a little , but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , pl@@ anners and their families only wor@@ ries , dist@@ ress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the assistant of the assistant and minist@@ ries with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries to be answered positively on the wor@@ m@@ ity and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ ings .
the employers hopes that the continued positive commitment to other major topics - such as resolution , flexibility for training , training , mutual recognition of education , education , mutual recognition of course , education , mutual recognition of education , education , education , health education , and health ministry relating to compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medication that can reduce heart health risk
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine , after the authorities recommended that more people are given for a longer period .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke , or a further heart attack .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended four years of intake in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended four years of intake in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and p@@ unch emer@@ gen@@ cies are caused by an@@ tivir@@ al material in the arter@@ ial walls , which form the flo@@ or@@ ings .
when the exposure breaks out , it may cause blood flow to hide the blood flow through the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood flow and flow blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack , are subject to higher risk to have a further risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is driven under the Bri@@ li@@ que trade name , reduces this risk by un@@ likely the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month dosage of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg daily with a twice daily consumption of A@@ spir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ols Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Healthcare System , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack , or stroke , often with des@@ ast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively improves the reduction of other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand treatment options on thousands of people who can benefit from that .
information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - mainly the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . introductory design recommends no treatment that proceeds over this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves elect@@ oral fr@@ aud in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on dism@@ iss@@ al of an Inter@@ governmental report for corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that far @-@ prolifer@@ ated election was wis@@ ely igno@@ red in Muslim communities as a non @-@ government @-@ governmental report today .
Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , the former cabinet member of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , is access@@ ing the evidence of elect@@ oral abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ations regarding eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who now is a ant@@ corrupt of v@@ oters from religious mo@@ tives , said that the police should be allowed to make shut@@ ters outside of elect@@ oral cabins , to protect v@@ oters from v@@ oters to protect v@@ oters .
he recommends that v@@ oters should carry out a reference to their identity in order to demonstrate their identity .
at present a v@@ oters must only call his name and address .
the report proposes , un@@ removable ink on the finger of a person when they give up their votes to prevent someone twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have access to community documents and decisions from not official comm@@ enc@@ ees or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only for elect@@ oral fr@@ aud , but also the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial support culture , which goes down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election square in the East of London .
last year , a Special Court decided that the acting Mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be ab@@ sent to corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ big@@ u@@ ary practices .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in Cyprus way , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ en@@ an@@ ow@@ ments to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man shall have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its campaign on the basis , that it is the religious duty of Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a after@@ mat@@ h , with one person as someone else sel@@ ects .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fr@@ aud throughout the country .
he has expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming for fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent letter of letters - at the older members of the Muslim community , they had made a candidate to choose their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to su@@ ck the elect@@ oral system , including the fo@@ xes of evidence to prove the identity
in his report , &quot; as proof was noted that pressure on protection needs of some ethnic minorities was carried out , especially women and young people to choose between the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Lebanese background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns ... state institutions explicitly ign@@ ore such behavior towards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convic@@ tions regarding eth@@ no and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to su@@ st@@ ain the system , including the ban , that political activists , correspondence documents , to stop &quot; election @-@ harvest . &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in consider@@ ations , also requires har@@ der registration checks to prevent the elect@@ oral directory to immigration and social stri@@ ves .
taking options in consideration , v@@ oters want to ask out of your selection after your notice .
not removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as they released their voice , someone has to el@@ ect twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three year old limit to applications on a automatic letter selection .
prohibition to process political activists complete letters and envelop@@ es from let@@ ins .
the police force the power to establish back@@ stops for elect@@ or@@ ations .
a law change , which facilitates the prosecution of in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ wir@@ l Law 1983 ) .
photographer offered in elect@@ oral stations .
requirements that only English can be used in elect@@ oral stations ( except Wales ) .
Inten@@ si@@ fication of the workout to ensure that the employees work rule , that v@@ oters will go in the cabin .
Sir Eric also falls on Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets fall , no criminal charges was made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elect@@ oral court ruled Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , for a lit@@ urg@@ y to corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on a number of reasons for in@@ sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - found guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the Imp@@ acts of &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ ul@@ ls &quot; of the Rath@@ au@@ tions of Rath@@ au@@ tions .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the trial in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
our country acts as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and the spread of elect@@ oral fr@@ aud and Leu@@ g@@ assing some authorities threatened this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger Olympi@@ ad in Rio
fans of the Olympics 2016 in Rio are over the French cycling team Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , except of border and band , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ coach in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Games is far not the only one who had gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least , if you cannot give the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , created at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a lists of Olympics , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s most famous .
the h@@ unters and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood
besides K@@ ates double @-@ singer on the race track , many people listening to the Internet , like a certain arc @-@ cap of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secret@@ ly .
in fact , the archers hit the mad@@ ness into the social media and gave it to listen to it since his childhood , he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself see no big simil@@ arity , with the exception of the visual hair@@ y , &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so don &apos;t miss it as compli@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be more in focus : the rising simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ z@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the SA s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der burgh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Morrison for years .
one step higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the Inc@@ lusive acting
another successful comparison was pulled between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the rus@@ sian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von Fans was att@@ ested , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others are similar to the simil@@ arities to others
theory in Space : according to that user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps one reason
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter username explained that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet think that Hope and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbelie@@ v@@ ably similar visual form and eyes .
another popular compar@@ isons are Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , who like her own beautiful , wide smile , res@@ embles that of Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought into the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; Color , &quot; he could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;

the Cri@@ tique Against Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard to talk about him
Twitter @-@ User did not go back when they heard how un@@ sensi@@ tively Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter username in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you first look at the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like Ras@@ si@@ sten . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel that hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ olog@@ ize that the commentary was broadcast@@ ed on a swimming performance . &quot;
it was a un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation , it &apos;s sorry that it &apos;s happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ olog@@ ized to the people at the end of more than 90 times , who answered on Twitter
the commentary Edition Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ olog@@ ize for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s behalf
C@@ BC copies and added his ap@@ ologies for more than 90 other Twitter browsers which have decided on the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ olog@@ ized quickly and issued a message .
we re@@ gre@@ t it correctly that these statements were made and that it was possible to be broadcast@@ ed .
yesterday we ap@@ olog@@ ized for our viewers yesterday night and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ en in the social media .
to be clear@@ ed , Byr@@ on comments related to the service of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ happy chosen formulation . Byr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ olog@@ ized in the show and tried to jus@@ tify his re@@ mark saying that it was not its intention to support them as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment for me to ap@@ olog@@ ize for the comments using women &apos;s floating aff@@ air in C@@ BC Olympic , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referring to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not related to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , there was no cont@@ emp@@ t , and doing it very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ ör@@ t over woman who tast@@ ed in the middle of business in@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where they should see , when a woman moved their clothes in a pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants .
in order to intensi@@ fy the situation , she numbered them as she looked , and put them back into the shelf .
they continued and tried four pairs of sub @-@ tro@@ users in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried under@@ p@@ ants before she finished them back into the shelf
one mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son , who was at the same time in the store said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and store the business without buying a bit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of sub @-@ tro@@ users from the out@@ lay , with@@ drew from their own ti@@ ghts and tro@@ users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did not even find a somewhat discre@@ te place to do it - it &apos;s just as little Oskar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every star@@ ters , when they returned to the bottom , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before it finally decided that you didn &apos;t feel right to come and r@@ aus@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not distur@@ b that any one observed , or think about the person who would have under@@ gone the under@@ p@@ ants who had tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. David@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as opposed to think that someone would take home with home who had another person and were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. David@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tries to draw up the garments from the sale after it went - what is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate them to go home with a new couple of underground and find out that another woman went and went out and washed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speaker from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident happened on Tuesday 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before ce@@ ase@@ fire
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him a little bit saf@@ er .
we talked with Rh@@ on M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to reach out with armed rob@@ bers .
regardless of whether you approach the front or behind , this video will show you how you turn away for your pre@@ dat@@ ors .
when you turn back from behind , you should turn the first turning back , so that you can see your attack@@ er and turn from the track line , &quot; says M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free ell@@ bow .
then beat him with the kne@@ es in the vest and rot@@ ate , while the attack@@ ers turn from pain@@ s , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move forward , while they make the weapon on him .
at attack@@ ers who are approaching from the front , the technology is similar - move your body from the push line , sei@@ ze the weapon and rot@@ ate it , so that attack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot them .
simultaneously store the weight on the weapon and beat the arms onto the chest , then turn the weapon out of his handle before moving back and turn on the weapon onto it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly as it makes M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi Pres@@ ence .
but remember that it is with a rob@@ ber@@ y of the saf@@ est , your money - if you don &apos;t have a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Reis@@ er Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t his tongue for a guide to the most dirty places of Europe
a British Reis@@ er under@@ went his immune system and saus@@ ages a serious test - providing some of the most dirty and ek@@ el@@ est locations in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk will shut down its course on a euro p@@ one , a ban@@ ked on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ge head of a tractor toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
in front of the rec@@ tan@@ gles of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show and show us what he will leave .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought to de@@ comp@@ ile the pur@@ ge of a pulling @-@ toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , but actually , in a kitchen , there are more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and their own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , nothing left what he wo@@ ke up , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by passing through the world , and ate strange and wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations to pur@@ ge buttons by toilets , the job provided its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned , what my health concerns and I have plug@@ ged all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and slaugh@@ ter . &quot;
in his film he was just a reputation for his reputation .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his dent@@ ure showed a lumin@@ esc@@ ence of over 4000 units .

Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the growth of bacteria in different locations like the bathroom
in the film he says , &quot; That &apos;s the worst thing I have landed in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I &apos;ll show nothing here , because there &apos;s inside here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria , as well as vitamin C and D in order to support intestinal bacteria and immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers something new .
something that is fascinating for watching and simultaneously explained the advantages of Pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ b@@ ings , who ended , that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumers more information on an interesting way .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense to humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lost my respect for Ian , if he had made some of the things that I have given him to l@@ end as the ek@@ y Russian toilet which will be shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things , in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them up and others , in which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty le@@ ak@@ ages . &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ d@@ ents were associated with the well @-@ being of gast@@ ric and intest@@ ines and 58 percent , that they contain at least occasionally products that contain l@@ actic acid bacteria .
the A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ing social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social in@@ dwelling after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50.000 , because they terror@@ ized her neigh@@ bors .
Tan@@ ya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing association , found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls ear@@ marked holes , wooden panels were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was decorated upon the walls .
the family were filled and it is assumed that they now lives in private accommodation .
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they don &apos;t have to rep@@ airing the apartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute Night@@ mare , and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious , and its reputation is also known .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police had said that the terror which joined the family had joined forces , police viol@@ ets , drug traffic@@ king , drug traffic@@ king , drug traffic@@ king , drug traffic@@ king , drugs and flu@@ ency .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name stood at the le@@ ase , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old litter became found
there were also found in the estate in which drugs were traded in the past .
neighbours said that she had strug@@ gling her on the street , and asked that the police had to be inv@@ oked upon the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing For@@ ced her and her partner this week violent by the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to go voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation had che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours , they said that her life was made to hell .
one said : &quot; they wonder@@ ed around anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times , which we say the police are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have been given the family to co@@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long
gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down on the prev@@ ailed side of the Municipal House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a shame that it was given the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ og@@ ing is always taking into consideration the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was a very difficult case since the behaviour of extreme and their deeds had to be terrible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community , who have been bra@@ ve to us and have given us the information provided .
I hope that this development is consol@@ ation consol@@ ation and the message provided that anti@@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck told that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 .

in 2014 , the police introduced a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ ons and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ don hasn &apos;t received a fine , after she pleaded guilty to the owner of a class B in commercial view .
she claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who arrived at a car accident in 2013 .
after having been without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that Tan@@ ya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many carp@@ entry of the house were seized with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she is ten@@ ant to hold ten@@ ants , which do not hold on the assignment
Angela C@@ row told by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall with that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , which do not hold on the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is thinking about those who can sei@@ ze themselves without self @-@ repro@@ aches , as well as those who were damaged by such a behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavi@@ ors who continue to co @-@ operate with partners to protect our communities .

the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans will be wor@@ ried by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative federal states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can high@@ lands Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported as something like concerns .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside the republi@@ can camp of the race , dou@@ b@@ ts grow on his success in battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ump against evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be bl@@ ame , false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can high@@ bur@@ ns
Utah normally is a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Surv@@ ey@@ America from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitors by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , stood up .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that can be custom@@ ary for republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as endanger@@ ed , Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endanger@@ ed .
in an interview of the transmitter of CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as he would stop the advance of Clin@@ tons again : &quot; as I did so far . &quot;
and if leaving : this will be &quot; either successfully , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he do not doing anything else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Olympia : three sc@@ am sc@@ am at d@@ oping test
the IOC wants to establish a disciplinary commission to the fall .
Ken@@ ias meet after the second d@@ oping aff@@ air during the Rio de Janeiro 2014 Olympic Games .
after an attempt at a d@@ oping control of a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee dealt with a disciplinary commission immediately to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function , the former Sprinter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village , had given a ur@@ ine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ äu@@ us@@ on Ro@@ tich .
this was reported by the team leadership of Ken@@ ias by D@@ oping control .
the International Association of IA@@ AF has searched for information on the case to strict own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF is an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called it in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone on the D@@ oping control station and issued himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ tich , handed down the sample and signed , &quot; stated Kenya &apos;s chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was owned by the Ac@@ cred@@ itation of athletes who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ tich was in 2015 in Beijing WM @-@ four@@ ter over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics leader Michael Ro@@ tich was with@@ drawn from Rio Olympics .
he should have informed about bud@@ s@@ ements of his country on the above d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly arrested his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been under special observation at the IOC according to the number of d@@ oping associations .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls in front of the Rio Olympics , unusual especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into consideration .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency held a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
a few weeks ago , the law was passed at the Olympia @-@ beginning .
subsequently , the WA@@ DA Kenya adopted from the list of countries whose D@@ oping fight conform to the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
most of the country won by the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of television reports , the ARD has always been repeatedly collected , that in Kenya D@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there should be a substantial ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IOC Member Richard Po@@ und was recently asked for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had employed them in Russian Athle@@ tics .
in this process , we could prove that in this sport , surface @-@ wide and systematically th@@ ron@@ ed .
Russia &apos;s athletes have subsequently been excluded from the Summer Olympics .

in the orchestra the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he is war@@ med .
we always say that she is quite Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have become Bern@@ st@@ eins , music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a older Mary .
she remin@@ is@@ cent of her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
Mary always fascin@@ ated me .
first because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then Mari@@ as would be the personality .
she says it &apos;s song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh such as Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she res@@ embles me very , my Italian character , whom I love as a red@@ dish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is fully responsible for the opera @-@ singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor for us to work with her .
she is an immen@@ sely spacious human being .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in every one of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that &apos;s all important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece , it &apos;s about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we didn &apos;t have the refugees to go to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want to know .
they are the same themes , and they are as well as meaning@@ fully as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and lo@@ aves ge@@ og@@ an , sits on packed caff@@ eine , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gü@@ len &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kur@@ dish congregation in Germany anticip@@ ates short @-@ thous@@ end with tens of thousands of seek@@ ers coming from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard drive of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , Kur@@ dish congregation anticip@@ ates a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands of people from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Pro@@ mis@@ chief Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already attracted nearly 500,000 stran@@ ds with criminal charges , 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were on the run .
after the failed coup , sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ able ethnic Turks were added .
many will begin ane@@ w in Europe if they will continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state who took refugees to refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consortium led to Syrian Arab Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in evidence of evidence .
thus , Erd@@ og@@ an will thus increase the travel pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , known to Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who also was the CDU @-@ member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of government demanded that the federal government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ch hunt &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics .
I won &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition .
the Brand@@ mark@@ ung as a Gü@@ len @-@ followers destroyed teachers and other academ@@ ics of professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and lo@@ ps Erd@@ og@@ an , sitting on packed caff@@ eine , also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialogue and Education &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already announced the largest group of asylum @-@ approved asylum rights in Germany before the coup .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als receive nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia shall not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
2021 will not take place at the end of summer holidays at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy Parliament voted already at the beginning of the year .
because it doesn &apos;t work as far as until now it is not : summer holidays , heat , and landing battle .
the loc@@ als that are convinced by the cho@@ ices are to be convinced of the vacation .
most tourists who are in the countryside are on Use@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no loc@@ als , so may not choose the country day .
these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ per , the plac@@ ards are hanging , air ballo@@ ons bub@@ bles , fl@@ yers and end up the end of the end , only lab@@ our@@ ism .
until 4 September 2016 , the elect@@ oral and final day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again have passed over to the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if one can say at all , has just begun .
and there is also something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , which has been most powerful since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
it will be exciting , as strongly new@@ com@@ ing AF@@ D remain and what remains at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , has an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign .
he travels across the country , spread ros@@ es , and pl@@ ums a little with the people , as it did already his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , the soul of cold will get cold feet , and Angela Merkel has the gu@@ ilt on the b@@ lossom of the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I accelerates the R@@ ise of Sp@@ ok@@ u@@ ties , which will presum@@ ably cost him this beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with their top candidates , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced , as it is when one makes for wrong time at the right place campaign .
she invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Grand Duke ; Merkel &apos;s German Bundestag is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Sachsen there as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; lam@@ ented Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently on NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel must listen .
otherwise , the northeast @-@ CDU dri@@ es largely on the usual elect@@ or@@ ings on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
that , so co@@ ached , plays only one &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also has master@@ ed that you need to move on the ground , that they must find themselves very strict again to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it goes like the Left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the times of the country hardly exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CDU campaign , Kok@@ ert to his fellow @-@ war , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go there where there will be away where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has now inv@@ oked his SPD with a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys the S &amp; D Group recently ended with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election 2011 , the SPD was still clearly won with 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Small Party , with seven percent in the p@@ olls , would probably do the leap into the country day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e out of the holiday of need and place their campaign towards the internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; , it is called Claudia Müller &apos;s state .
otherwise , there are green sel@@ ections to domestic search for domestic stim@@ ul@@ ators among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ k@@ an@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat by the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it still beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed of speed , which is sanc@@ tified with the B 27 , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ed .
for the persons responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 am , and until at least 20 o &apos;clock , there are all pra@@ ises praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made all quite sk@@ chy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a superb team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved to the half @-@ time scheduled to be south until the end of October will be all finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the escape will also be praised for the construction works , approximately when it comes to the establishment of housing cru@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen is abol@@ ished and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg was rev@@ amped and the traffic situation has been relaxed within the resort .
citizens can now return from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
check @-@ out traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Vice @-@ President Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ u@@ ach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to struggle with more traffic noise , because many cock@@ tails searched for themselves as the sign@@ posts .
what this led to man@@ oeu@@ v@@ ans in residential areas .
since the speed lim@@ ousine does not have been adher@@ ed to the congregation re@@ iter@@ ates the v@@ icious car from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable consider@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who made herself more about the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were actually two to three per minute .
the fast @-@ speed was on the pace with 77 kilometres per hour .
however , since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become calm .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that is open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg to open the road again .
business@@ men don &apos;t want to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 has led to their net sales in terms of sales , each one of them can be ques@@ tioned .
however , some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , so for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decrease &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also note that of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cat@@ astrophe is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most explo@@ ited are the local ones along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ent threat@@ ening .
not only him , but all the inn@@ s have met &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil were missing .
we must be glad over each Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the net sales rose to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking have thrown his operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must have dismissed the half of his associates .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , the policy would have responded to politics .
instead , the leader President Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise it benefited from the advantages of the position on the B 27 . now they are also the dis@@ advantages that contribute to the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where such a lot of funding has been added .
in all the col@@ lagen , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family company has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
due to the complex traffic management less frequently , it can understand that other family passengers should be less frequent , then he can understand .
if one can &apos;t drive it , it &apos;s also very different .
after the completion of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the cris@@ es with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner re@@ tains the effects of the B 27 works to its customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
constantly under the name of the terrorist fight , laws shall be screw@@ ed .
after the recent proposals , the interior minister of the Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thic@@ ker security package .
but what does a fung@@ us status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Finance in the presentation of his new security package .
they are demanding anyone .
others , additional points would initially be discussed within the parties .
too , I pray for me too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister of Interior , however , to him results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach demonstrated a little time before he presented his conclusions for the safety in the republic .
but these are however , however , more extensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot is announced , announced that a new security authority to worry about the neck of encrypted communication is not new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives to flight data and tru@@ ce law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reputation for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities are equally surprising .
to become part of the Mai@@ zi@@ ère , a second race for proposals which have not been doing with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ ise for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ bs with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU @-@ Mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still hold this nevertheless for reasonable and challenging anything , which had no chances for the coalition partner .
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in himself : it plans the procedure for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation .
refugees to be brought to the land before their smart phones , let social media accounts for security check @-@ in before .
with Dul@@ ce for expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to continue worse than to date - about such that off@@ ences or disc@@ ern their papers to wear their identity .
some of them is politically and legally hei@@ gh@@ tened .
man@@ ches also works even un@@ balanced and leaves any questions openly .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ ser for example - is the question : what exactly does it have to do with security and terror ?
yes , it says , Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it would not be in speech that the assassination of Ans@@ bach and W@@ uer@@ z@@ burg were inc@@ urred .
in addition , many people rose by the high number of refugees to worry about security .
and things that are deeply sum@@ med up , were not allowed in election hours even in election hours .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ security is great .
and yes , they stand sel@@ f@@ ights .
the Union and SPD are increasingly bringing about inner security increasingly in position .
in the past few days , it was high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then concerning a security policy collection of some Feder@@ alist interior minister , also called a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was too lab@@ ori@@ ental here in more con@@ cili@@ atory tones .
nothing can hold from a return to return from double pass .
we will meet the discussions in Germany .
it will be re@@ charged , unless otherwise useful .
and on a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition , he constitutional obj@@ ection .
whether his own package at all corners is un@@ constitutional , and if it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; is not yet to show .
it &apos;s a lot that could be something for war .
but the SPD also tries to pro@@ ving inner safety on the subject of internal security .
party Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes a c@@ auti@@ ous conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contribute to increasing the security . &quot;
Volkswagen still comes close by Volkswagen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite diesel emissions , output figures are increasing worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not in all markets it runs around .
with the feedback action , there are inver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e around a term .
in the second half of the year Volkswagen , Volkswagen starts to start supplies in the second half .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s largest motor@@ ways can continue to make an increase of well @-@ run markets despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
however , in July , the VW &apos;s core brand en@@ acted mainly in Western Europe and thus maintained the total sales , as indicated in the D@@ ax listed company .
in July , the VW brand sold a 1.8 per cent of 1.8 per cent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries are almost a six @-@ st@@ el .
Group president Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the we@@ aker numbers from July , mainly on two sales days in Europe .
in addition , there have been in some core markets by &quot; changed economical framework &quot; a purchase price .
in addition to the situation around the Putin &apos;s attempt in Turkey , British V@@ ot@@ um suffered a talk of talk about the EU .
in the U.S. , where the exhaust gas aff@@ air initially es@@ cal@@ ated , is also further a min@@ us too be@@ ech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the most affected table stamp of Lower Saxony is fore@@ seen by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an output minus of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is limited .
Group leader Fred Kap@@ pler managed to present a sales growth from January to July .
Volkswagen has delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust @-@ tests .
in Germany alone , VW is calling approximately 2.5 million wagons for retro@@ fitting to the workshops .
in the wake of retro@@ fitting Volkswagen , the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
after conversion of vehicles , it is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output .
after retro@@ fitting the customer to the re@@ arm@@ ament a &quot; warranty &apos; certificate , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; warranty , &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate circles .
reason are legal entities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen has now wi@@ ped his German customers a guarantee for diesel @-@ equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were confirmed by the Federal Office of Office in the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday .
from the traffic department has been confirmed that there was a meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has accomplished the editions of my In@@ quiry Commission and the KBA &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations of these are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has acquired the warranty for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output after re@@ arm@@ ament , no wor@@ sen@@ ing , and all type appro@@ vals relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
in Volkswagen itself , Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not how it was called in corporate circles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen is the possibility that customers go for example a half year after re@@ arm@@ ament roughly with a engine damage in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in customer interests , it is important to avoid that there is no other damage to any other damages , which comes to safegu@@ arding any warranty policy , as it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , VW will not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demanded from rich austerity plans - as the second institute in Germany .
Chief Financial Officer Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 clients that park 40 million euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily bank accounts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German Banks speaks of one single incident and does not see any signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not to be afraid to pay for their austerity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wareh@@ ouses in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , banks must pay by 0.4 percent of pen@@ alties at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100.000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary accounts .
&quot; the first 100.000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will start € 400 per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ski@@ pped 40 million Euros that could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other , and could not be able to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the banking chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie for every million 4000 euros . &quot;
the cost is now giving following the cur@@ sor principle .
the cash just in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four transi@@ tions , I do not like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank &apos;s Chief Financial Officer .
most clients have understanding and sel@@ dom based on other investment forms .
only few moves to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of ECB causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you alone can wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business economically permanently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could not be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or credit transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger was made head@@ lines with its sk@@ ate bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Banking Association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private clients to pay attention to deposits . in addition , the competition in Germany is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see it is &quot; a client@@ ele that is equipped with a fortune cookie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a little bank for the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it sh@@ ook money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently not known as other banks , who calculate the compensation for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German People &apos;s Association and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banken - BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold , negative to neg@@ atives , is very high , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition is hard , and it threatened the migration of investors for competition .
customers in Germany will not enjoy that in the width of the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who bu@@ ys Sound@@ records ?
lon@@ ely males like middle ages .
before comm@@ ent@@ uation @-@ parts , in order to over@@ saw him under the pseud@@ onym @-@ non @-@ bal@@ sam@@ pler of age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most popular recovery of sound plates do not want to be a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a record , are the fore@@ sight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
there is no hor@@ des through hob@@ bies - it has an emotional significance : older Platt@@ form@@ ers keep their feelings rather to spend ( 56 % vs 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time to spend on time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow my camera , while I move in a bu@@ st@@ ling street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest gray suit , my hands hold and something better tell us like : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at a glance . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart rate So@@ H@@ os goes slowly at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices , now fill up the buildings where once independent sal@@ es@@ man are located - there is a hand@@ ful fantastic business specialised .
I would probably ask the camera to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in the immediate vicinity of different men in such shops , try to assess their age and mind of observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I recorded by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men aged middle ages ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men aged middle ages , a woman probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , question ?
&quot; I guess &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates .
this Schall@@ platten , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not yet followed at home ) , dress the walls of its residential room .
the reason why he has a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records , which he could not aff@@ ord to buy them when he sold young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early &apos; 70s , who had appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I thought some too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted , and like this time to spend time , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I smoke , and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is my L@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , which works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets for You@@ Go@@ v @-@ profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the medi@@ ator , people who have heard about com@@ eback , and you will see to buy their old plates again .
from the conversations which I have led , people generally have ap@@ olog@@ ized for about 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their boards to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their boards again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to trailers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like phon@@ ica to recognize that record stores a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ est@@ ants .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of familiar record sleeves , from objects , happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ ts of a emp@@ tin@@ ess or possession of material property than a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that &apos;s with me as a collector so I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put a staff of a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April disclos@@ ed that almost 50 % of the people who have purchased a record last month , they have not heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I was looking through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( number of people : three men of middle ages ) has been producing a &quot; t@@ roph@@ ic asp@@ iration &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone recently returned here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Sound plate , so I can ask them into the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music las@@ ci@@ ously .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who come first slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has an evil public than I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make the photos , teenagers and women aged middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops , wild syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ tet pop instead of experimental Jazz were used from the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks strange , but n@@ ag@@ ating psychological gra@@ mat@@ a are hard @-@ det@@ ectable , if you stand for 30 seconds in length .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and consider the vari@@ ance of the panels for sale .
it &apos;s more a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ette b@@ um@@ bs than a big one @-@ one .
it doesn &apos;t deser@@ ves much , therefore it &apos;s no real option to collecting disks .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from one computer or to other ways , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; they drives them with a sweet s@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of self @-@ lovers will be inspired by Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the licence to sample the Je@@ ans hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager to group@@ ed for a moment about Polar@@ oid Cam@@ eras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics that essential panels for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to hold them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most of luxury objects like plates .
even though my research results , that the results of You@@ Go@@ v can vote , at least in record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the great number of female Coll@@ ectors in S@@ oh@@ o , which exist in reality , business shops and online in online .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety by hanging by hanging shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they cope with the star@@ ring views of an infinite , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who runs out over the shoul@@ ders of middle age .

French Court re@@ jects offer of demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , live in the thousands of refugees .
in order to negoti@@ ate this week , the authorities moved to Cal@@ ais that the state should be able to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ al shops , in which persons can offer or buy tea services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be over@@ thrown because they would not be paid a parallel economy , which would not be paid to tax and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups participated in the court that the shops and restaurants are important , since the free meals that are offered by the state @-@ supported Association and other groups are not enough food for the growing numbers in stock .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants will often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the deportation of people who run the 72 Pro@@ vision@@ al transactions , however , that the concerns of Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture will be completely re@@ trac@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food business , caf@@ és and restaurants will play a lot of major role , when only people live , living in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas can provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Camp , which is non @-@ profit @-@ operated and 200 meals a day , in English and French , and one consultation on asylum matters for hundreds of protection of protection , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in stock .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was called the closure &quot; for this children of a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
the two relief organisations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants are estimated on Friday that the number of people rose up to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers in the summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hon@@ est@@ ly difficult to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he would like to analyze in peace , what are the reasons for de@@ ac@@ el .
Martin actually wanted to fight the title at the Time World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will have everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the en@@ forcement trailer
Germany R@@ aser must be set to the next generation speed control : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested especially effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement Trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for the accident , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on highway construction or to sanitary bridges with temporary Tem@@ p , there are often no necessary infra@@ structures to ensure compliance with speed lim@@ iter .
a durable mobile building , however , can be dangerous or elabor@@ ately .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery resist@@ s five days , the case data are transmitted via a modem .
with laser @-@ measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously through several tracks .
variable speed lim@@ iting as well as passage access according to time , passenger and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly poll@@ uted state , one can move the trailer to manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling .
so that it is not simply cl@@ amped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ es and by the way will van@@ ish out @-@ safe outer man@@ ure .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system will protect the gl@@ itter in front of v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
even foreign authorities flash@@ es with the new technology : recently , France has re@@ ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 copies last year .
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gold ob@@ sol@@ es
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday night at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji granted a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , night @-@ back , liner and raw power to gain gold - their first Olympic wa@@ ist of any color .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat was failed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Silver medal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ots , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals of the same day could fall on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have sm@@ itten with this form a 15 @-@ man @-@ team .
it could be for GB a consol@@ ation - but it will probably not - that at least one sh@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal to his neck ; Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult road behind .
eight years ago , they lost among Ryan any game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they lost only one .
this s@@ lap will we@@ ave , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and left the attacks of GB@@ S from Sp@@ ass .
it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co . kg , when running in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au walked in the corner .
at another four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai played a further attack out of the right corner that he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly opp@@ ose the ball .
a h@@ ack@@ ing fli@@ ck@@ le of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa , a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua spar@@ ked a touch down in the right corner and it stood at 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ over by another weak t@@ ack@@ lings of GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is so , when Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while Britain is still studying .
it is like that too .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for almost four minutes , what was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua had crossed the Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant stop@@ over of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton , launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favour of the South @-@ cat@@ chers , his fans s@@ ni@@ sts , b@@ bs and dance on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ams put the i @-@ door posts with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ber@@ ship emb@@ ell@@ ished , the fi@@ j@@ is enc@@ irc@@ led and the GB k@@ ick@@ ly beaten up in the lawn .
earlier in the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK ur@@ ged South Africa in a cris@@ p @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton on the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late t@@ ack@@ ling of Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ seaside teams , secured the gain - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the Train@@ ers
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eres of gold than those games , and that wants what will be hot .
from the first rowing machine to the last , 220 hard hits that go down into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if it was only the Bei@@ ds who sat at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams was all present for the second Olympic woman in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , who put on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all of her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ disp@@ le@@ ased operation , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins that gli@@ des on the surface of the elegance of pigs , which does not reflect the type of the Tri@@ umph@@ al Ar@@ ch .
behind each gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on suffering from hel@@ pers that make the difference and it was no hair@@ y than the trainer , who would not know that day at all , he was diagnosed at all that day when cancer was diagnosed .
how he spoke , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not do that , he spreads anywhere .
it would have been a rather narrow situation .
a little bit changed .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had happiness that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which could start to a minimum , if this is the correct term in such circumstances .
I needed money , therefore it had to go to me again soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was at the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet to 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
it begins so .
the rowing itself is a challenge , but it makes it an even bigger one .
in the in@@ ability of victory we went their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ding morning to do something more than otherwise , and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , which was a cent@@ ur@@ ion of the Royal artill@@ ery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ rack . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repeated , how much I and Helen and Helen also have worked with Robin , too .
it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would not have a better person for your train@@ ee or better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up close .
even during the last 500 meters , they began to catch the teams from New Zealand and Denmark , st@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to let not break down .
we had a good start and at the same time , we were not making something big .
we didn &apos;t want a fireworks , we wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take one year for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have been much pressure .
in London there lasted approximately six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .

the managing director of the water purpose &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water purpose association as an example for the large water producers .
this is what happened to the original Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , some time ago .
a little later , the water @-@ forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken denied the ken@@ nel association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ emeyer group emp@@ tied &quot; Bavarian &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twen@@ ties , of which 28 years as managing director .
he was retired at the age of 65 at the age of 65 .
the drinking water purpose of the V@@ ou@@ estones Group headquartered in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , supports about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants annually .
member states are the churches churches , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water delivery contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ is@@ cent of that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller worked as a water @-@ wart in 1985 and has been appointed director of the Zw@@ eck@@ ter Association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extend from water management and repair work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new foun@@ tains ( 1994 ) , compensation in the area of the new foun@@ tains ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer control system ( 1999 ) , the creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water lines .
there was no stand@@ still to have been given , and I always picked up new additions , because water rep@@ ented and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lu@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water sports , and he lived in the water sports association as if it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practition@@ er , he had to present the success of the V@@ eit@@ emeyer on nit@@ rate limitation in front of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken &apos;s Water Forum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , he received very much recognition and praise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the hand , sang pra@@ ises Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he &apos;s the best water@@ keeper and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from its view@@ point he described the well @-@ called Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ organisation of the ken@@ nel association .
the biggest challenge and most difficult applications were the sl@@ ump in the floods at Kirch@@ sin@@ an on a 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees , the whole night had to be working , so that the towns could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n have to be maintained once only because one filled the bu@@ ckets of P@@ ett@@ oh@@ m with hoses .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man was shot at a family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock and killed them in its partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called ourselves with us and given to their li@@ ken@@ ess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a ze@@ ze@@ al woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator be on the run , after him will be public@@ ised publicly .
now Sven S. could be on the way with the car .
the man is approximately 1,80 meters tall , musc@@ ular , brown and has a gl@@ itter .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ itter .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could bear the weapon with himself , so the police .
who sees Sven S. is to call the 110 call .
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship with relationship . &quot;
the sacrifice was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to do no information about the ather@@ land or relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it &apos;s a k@@ is@@ diction . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a political scientist in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the cra@@ cking and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions @-@ height .
financial loads , which are threatened by the industry from the green electricity generation , are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Liberation of Renewable Energy Transmission &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for existing electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission planned accordingly then planned to use steel producers to ask gases from the oven to power generation for your own consumption .
according to German industry associations , the steel industry has an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , which is now giving a certificate with the EU Commission after talks with Com@@ peti@@ tive Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators will be replaced in steel units , all an EEG compensation of 20 percent .
but these will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for self @-@ stro@@ king production .
this means the status Quo from the previous regulation become largely defined .
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our Campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even during the reform of the emission standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall @-@ head Jörg Hofmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis of 2008 under surplus capacities and a substantial price .
last year , the situation has intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s largest producer in China , given the we@@ aving domestic demand for mass demand in the world market .
European producers take China &apos;s steel conc@@ ert@@ ante price sho@@ cking .
in the course of this spring the situation has relaxed .
to a show , import tari@@ ffs on impor@@ ter effects , for others , the economic prospects in China have increased .
it is unc@@ le@@ ar , how sustainable is recovery .
the German industry pri@@ gg@@ y Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp c@@ auti@@ ously lodged there on Thursday .
last , the prices could be stagn@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp always wanted to un@@ lock the last works of individual plants .
at the end of 2015 , some 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July the German steel producers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced approximately 3.4 million tonnes of a good six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous month , as the Steel Division had taken place on Friday .
after a short increase in May the crowd went back to one another in the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year .
in the coming months , the association expects to increase in improved order situation with increasing output .
Community , mind , health : singing sen@@ iors good
since young girl , Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied all her life : as young girl she was in the school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today he s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir .
&quot; singing me - emotional and physical , &quot; describes them .
after a rehear@@ sal , it feels balanced , mer@@ r@@ ily and a total of life , says it .
Incid@@ entally , they do something good with her health and her mind .
because singing is equal to several perspectives : a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard Hack@@ ler from the German Academic League .
most sen@@ iors are singing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes Hack@@ ler .
through regular mer@@ gers , sen@@ iors can establish social contacts and maintain .
because frequently dis@@ solve social and family structures in age , one choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to arrange themselves and to organize themselves on the others , a choir is a special form of compositions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , supp@@ ose h@@ ack@@ ler .
he exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who ur@@ ges his lung regularly , is not so fast as fast as the pu@@ rest .
even though it comes to receive the sound of voice in the age , singing is an optimum hobby .
for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour Community for Sen@@ iors .
in the older generations , the common S@@ ingen had a much higher job value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz observed often that singing or list@@ eners of songs in elderly people are aw@@ ak@@ ened , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by song lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , human beings ab@@ hor@@ red themselves in long @-@ related events .
when singing , a special performance in the singing , L@@ enz will also be required .
simultaneously on the own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great co@@ gni@@ tive challenge .
even older people who alone are living , practic@@ ing themselves , don &apos;t just concentrate on himself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one goes through the singing in the choir , Hack@@ ler writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing through singing in the choir .
to show itself : if I &apos;m a long time for something I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing with singing , is there enough .
whoever wants to try out a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he believes , little talent , does L@@ enz have .
man does not sing alone - at 50 singing people , who list@@ ens to it when a tone is coming beside it ?
looking for the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says Hack@@ ler .
anyone s@@ ings someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ability in a n@@ udi@@ or , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer views of choirs in the surrounding area .
who wish to sing in a religious choir , can directly contact the church or church leaders .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
whoever has no access to the internet can ask family , friends or neigh@@ bors to ask help with the Internet calculator .
who &apos;s desire to sing , should not be connected to a choir , that h@@ ack@@ ler h@@ ack@@ ler .
singing the soul good and has something completely liber@@ ating - this applies to every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as cr@@ ater on the cry of the young
biolog@@ ists have studied in Hannover , which effect the ru@@ pul@@ ls of cat &apos;s bab@@ ys on adult animals .
for their surprise , the Mi@@ racle took not the males , however , however , in contrast to the females always stopped .
female cats may recognize the ra@@ inf@@ ant of Kat@@ zen@@ Bab@@ ies at the r@@ ust of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens which have found themselves in great dist@@ ress , such as scientists from the veterinary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
although tom@@ cat react also to the ru@@ b of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always immediately .
&quot; obviously , the acou@@ sti@@ cal differences between the r@@ ust of less and heavily er@@ ra@@ ined young are either non @-@ perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of importance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o @-@ Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is the first author@@ itative study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the team had already found that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ scre@@ ech@@ es differenti@@ ates with the ur@@ gency of their help .
a total of nine adult males and eight cr@@ aters were observed from the MH@@ H hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a little bit of little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from Mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
in addition , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger ra@@ ined k@@ itt@@ ens , which were added additionally high .
the researchers hold their results despite the small sample for meaning@@ ful .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned back faster to the speaker if this ruins of the very well @-@ known k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males respon@@ ds at all , &quot; said the Biolog@@ y@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in baby noise in the past .
some studies show that women re@@ acted sensitive to su@@ peri@@ ors , although they were already mothers or not reported that the Biolog@@ y@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes action with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sou@@ k@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an South Coast .
it is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
an important soccer game for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between B@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis , Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already in the suspension of acceptance after the crash test in July , the government , the daily life of normal brushes must not be imp@@ aired .
but this does not apply to those who suspected the movement of the Pre@@ dig@@ nity Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for Putin &apos;s attempt .
football is not made before the football .
against the earlier Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Southern Tab@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office provided an arrest warrant .
accordingly , the southern region of South Pacific is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
the Pre@@ dig@@ nity Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len be responsible , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
this is true for 90 days of exceptional circumstances until October , actually the life of most Turks , but as good as no effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy gu@@ ards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places in the whole country has been officially declared on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into trailer and opponent &apos;s Erd@@ og@@ ans .
especially fans of the working @-@ club Fel@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what was the Gro@@ wing &apos;s Gro@@ s in view of dramatic experiences in history , strict re@@ jection of military coup .
there &apos;s even the fans yourself - no matter whether you be@@ ats their hearts for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Po@@ kal@@ sieg@@ er &quot; Gala , &quot; there will be a very special message to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Cologne season recorded its sporty value in the past season , with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ lin@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atik &quot; told him : &quot; he was the best on the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the t@@ rophy for his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master took a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; would also look early in the Europa League .
in the south of the south , it only ran@@ ged to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the playing year was better .
above all thanks Mario Gom@@ ez , who scored 26 seasonal number of season as the South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ tor@@ ch as the basis for the 14th titles .
this is also the reason that fans hope to return to the return of 31 @-@ year @-@ olds .
at the same time , the AC Florence had agreed upon contract and passed on B@@ ik@@ t@@ as only bor@@ row@@ ed Gom@@ ez after putting the attempt to return on the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ik@@ ret F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this , the stor@@ ms would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce for roughly one @-@ third of its valued at € 7.5 million , Or@@ man clear : &quot; its salary in Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes have even medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin had been closed twice because of d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa is not going to start in Rio .
others , Athle@@ tics sin@@ ner , can only lau@@ gh - they are fighting in Rio around medals .
the theme d@@ oping is determined by the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics Games .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had been compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping @-@ lock , was bo@@ iled right before the games , was caught and hat@@ ched at their start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
there was a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scene : with an upright smile , she was still proud to stum@@ ble into the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
as a noted that they will not get gold , the audience broke into a junk@@ yard .
but there are still numerous sports@@ men that go to the start despite d@@ oping past during the Rio Olympics Games .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
it was closed for two time because of d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion goes even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ times world championship in 2010 had to sit down six months after taking the pain using Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , they had a severe t@@ ooth@@ ache to defend the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European championships have been positively tested to the forbidden stim@@ ul@@ ant drug of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the insur@@ rection and was blo@@ cked for six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters in this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ av@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sh@@ awn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was closed positively in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a means for penis enlargement was responsible , fired Mer@@ rit Mer@@ rit .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes won &apos;t be noticed so many medals .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost its World Cup title , nine years later , after having been identified testosterone d@@ oping .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ Title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
due to the judgment of the 2008 Olympic Games , the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille has returned to the CA@@ S decision on the basis of a sentence .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is on the rank of two of the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and Gold@@ av@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but still may start in Rio .
during the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championships , references to a banned food supplement have been found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA was mild , and ran already on July 13 .
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Sa@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
she suffered s@@ ni@@ w@@ ounds and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left this again .
she planned her hom@@ eb@@ ound trip at the beginning of September .
whether from the other explo@@ sions on the vac@@ ations of island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on , Austrian citizens are still not unc@@ le@@ ar .
in this regard , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , in constant contact with local authorities , says Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
on Thursday night , the Hu@@ a H@@ in &apos;s capital , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , two bom@@ bs explo@@ des .
according to the police , they were killed by Thai police and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning again two spr@@ inkl@@ es went high , according to the authorities a further human being killed .
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the Det@@ onation in the popular seaside resorts Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded by a municipal employees .
according to the authorities in a flower bed , the spr@@ inkl@@ es went into the air , according to the authorities .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations called on Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
in connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was named .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb det@@ erg@@ ate carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ar@@ me@@ eg@@ en@@ eral Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re assum@@ ing that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express itself to possible mo@@ tives - probably , it was about the works of Muslim reb@@ els .
also Thai media wanted to reco@@ gn@@ ise a pattern on the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police stated that attacks are not related to Islam@@ ist interventions or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it rather , rather , from that the bom@@ bs of the ruling of the ruling j@@ un@@ ta were laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities have received sec@@ ur@@ ly comments on the upcoming attack in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and place of locations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still be unc@@ le@@ ar , which group behind the stro@@ kes .
the police pointed out their civil servants to intensi@@ fy safety around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement neighborhood .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge any way to tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ ib@@ ol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason of the years of bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs advis@@ es to the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high level of safety ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ands and its envir@@ ons .
according to disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary travel in these provinces are not necessary .
increased safety risk ( Security level 2 ) to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this would also become a major influence in the military in the coming years .
j@@ unk Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha , the bom@@ bs would have been an attempt to ass@@ ure chaos while maintaining the country towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloo@@ dy un@@ rest , is self @-@ evident , the kingdom return to stability and order .
however , it is also not managed to get the military in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , Bangkok had been killed in an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; identi@@ fier movement &quot; is in the vis@@ or of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several different offices , the constitutional complaint in the Federation also made the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ fication Movement &apos; for asp@@ ir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Military Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , growth of Islamic Faith or from the Middle East will be diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore we watch the movement now .
the &quot; Identi@@ ties Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
she turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of your own identity by survi@@ vors . &quot;
the constitutional court in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - watch the &quot; Identi@@ fication &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority is closely align@@ ed with the provincial offices .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identi@@ al movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
generally extrem@@ ists try to arrange them with young women , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the open Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ trem@@ ors .
that &apos;s no bet@@ tered advertising for your own thing .
propaganda will appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are vulner@@ able there in special way .
this is dangerous .
recently , there were reports from several federal states reports on the contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; to AF@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he had no knowledge .
possible contacts this type is only relevant for the constitutional protection from a certain point .
it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the AF@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , changing their objective and so extrem@@ ist .
so , if such people control the control of the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a look at the clear increase of legal @-@ bo@@ tivi@@ zation and assault on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights in this context .
but we have established ourselves in recent years that there can be legal frozen structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be quite true that further illegal log@@ istic group groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing @-@ wing motifs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal ror@@ i@@ ism , however , is not recogni@@ zable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups were created on regional level or social networks .
however , Ma@@ ate expressed that many convic@@ tions went to the account of people who previously appeared not in the right scene in appearance .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ icious attack on asylum houses were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences that were with right @-@ sex@@ ist even nothing at the hat , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who , however , have been radic@@ alized by the right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ sburg becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic Games or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bra@@ ve performance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the Rio de Janeiro summer Olympics .
in the aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly above @-@ important s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he was not able to see more in the TV images .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was selected .
subsequently , Hab@@ its was subsequently joined as a viral intervention in social networks .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old has finished his fore@@ front and took the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
it was rather his un@@ just sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ up from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to do swimming in many different countries .
most sports@@ men run in e@@ uri@@ di@@ ia , willing to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ ed is ready for the big race .
quickly , the first nick@@ names signed the round .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL der W@@ al . &quot;
based on a &quot; welfare service &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ sheet &quot; The Sun &quot; made me fun with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot;
his time he struck only with a minute and nearly five seconds over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle , while no role played .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i cat@@ ered for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the gig of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy of E@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea that he had to compete in a subur@@ b of 100 m Fre@@ estyle alone .
in then , Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at the time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swi@@ m eight months before Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the new place has been fo@@ al .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ sh@@ rie@@ der@@ ers leave their business on Monday at 17.@@ 30 pm , and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when they came back next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , the c@@ asse had disappeared from around 250 Euro .
traces of the perpet@@ rator could not be found .

tr@@ ump does not see the threatened elect@@ oral situation not so tight
Republi@@ can Presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks at a election campaign in Florida .
should it be aware of the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already been an alternative video .
he traveled to vacation .
he loses Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential elections in November , would it be either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a phone interview with the US TV channel CNB@@ C .
if it is not rich in political correc@@ t@@ ness to the end , that is right , t@@ ump said .
thus , he signed the U.S. President Barack Obama and the Can@@ did@@ acy of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist organisation Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more resistance formed always .
next will increase in trade with electrical supplies
an electric feed vehicle from the German Post in action .
the interest of other firms on the pl@@ um@@ age is apparently large .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ scooter .
shortly the Group wants to start trade with the transporter .
next year , the post plans to offer their electrical transpor@@ ters from the next year on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go to third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been veri@@ fi@@ able for months , whether they are to be supplied with their own Stre@@ et@@ scooter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell other firms .

Ger@@ der had announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and long run a complete conversion to environment @-@ friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we represent the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Scooter has been active in Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
Gf@@ K Leadership occurs after dis@@ appo@@ inting business numbers
the consumer research company Gf@@ K de@@ af his b@@ oss Matthias Hartmann .
although the back@@ packs suddenly appeared - but not surprisingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficult situation in the Gf@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Research Group Gf@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caused that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann became more uncer@@ tain , longer than that of him promised successes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the resignation of corporate management stands the global number Five in the industry in front of a person@@ alised new start .
Gf@@ K @-@ Management @-@ CEO wants to leave the company for the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K @-@ Supervisory Board Ar@@ no grinding has already been leaving from the Supervisory Board effective 12 September .
the management of the Executive Board had already taken over the previous board member of the Executive Board , Gerhard Haus@@ scher , issued the company on 1 September .
he is supposed to take over the function of a &quot; executive officer &quot; until a successor for Hartmann .
as a reason for the back@@ ward , the company called &quot; different views &quot; to the long @-@ term corporate social orientation .
details would not call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
whoever will lead the market research company in future , is still unc@@ le@@ ar .
on Friday , during the shareholders , there was last dis@@ appointment on the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the restructuring that occurred prior to years .
Mr. Hartmann has been working at the Gf@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of re@@ structur@@ ings are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business numbers each shareholders will eventually take un@@ quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be in case of BMW , this would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to return trips in the pre @-@ quarters , the companies could not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
sales of EUR 36@@ 1.2 million was 6.1 percent below the level of the prior @-@ year figure .

the fees per cubic meter of wast@@ e@@ water will be 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage plant New dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ igh@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( earlier 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( earlier 2.@@ 18 Euros ) .
in the facility in Az@@ endorf the wast@@ e@@ water treatment will then increase again , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
after an outstanding calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 Euro per cubic meter .
as mayor of Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported to the land@@ fill of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ et Kul@@ mb@@ ach noted that wast@@ e@@ water treatment plants was established .
the Casino Market is oblig@@ ated to carry out public foundations due to legal foundations .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens , as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ is@@ cop@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se .
the rate increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Chairman of the Board of Directors of Herbert Schmidt was necessary to re@@ charge the fees for wast@@ e@@ water treatment facilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ weight and uni@@ forms are equal to the previous period of the previous period .
the gra@@ ce@@ ful crime increases , Schmidt thus established that with all three wast@@ e@@ water plants with relatively small wast@@ e@@ water treatment , lies between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
due to its low distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs would inter@@ ce@@ ased out of several thousand Euros .
in addition , the wast@@ e@@ water treatment is slightly dec@@ lining in all three plants .
furthermore , in the past calendar period during all three plants , not least due to their age , re@@ financing and repair expenses in a considerable extent .
the facility in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the is@@ os@@ cel@@ ess , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage during the wast@@ e@@ water plant in Az@@ endorf .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sh , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ looked after almost 20 years of operation of the first clari@@ fication pond , the se@@ wage slu@@ dge dischar@@ ges and an additional ventilation facility to be installed in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the responsible care and maintenance costs agreed to take into account accordingly in the new cold period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 still clearly under the current level .
stone houses considerably made that small wast@@ e@@ water treatment in the three plants will propose the expenditure for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
in this respect , Schmidt has remained the market community of great consumer cost for wast@@ e@@ water treatment plants over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned installations will continue to remain pre@@ valent , as to maintain the supply area of the water sports association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to make these plants could not be enlarged because it concerns de@@ pri@@ itarian facilities .

snap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ e &quot; Effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ises
snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e insp@@ ires , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , it allows for Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily u@@ users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders even the absur@@ d .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichten@@ stein painting .
the filters are un@@ covered , self @-@ driven tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ enium per day .
all failure arrive to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have taken criticism of the past in the past , in which they accused the app to prop@@ ag@@ ate or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week , some browsers struck a filter , which gave them mud , false teeth and un@@ dark che@@ eks , there was some critics a ra@@ cial car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ or@@ ating h@@ awk . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated contro@@ vers@@ y referred to a bigger problem , that the company has over diversity .
the messages and the in@@ dig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Motherboard , one day after Snap@@ chat hur@@ ried that it would have changed the feature disabled .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was considered homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but exterior , rac@@ ism experienced , remin@@ ded of the filters of injury c@@ lich@@ és .
other refused the anim@@ e comparison decided .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et has been widespread far beyond the photos that the filter was &quot; infr@@ ing@@ ling and un@@ comfortable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult to ar@@ gue with the return of a very contra@@ dic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter has not bo@@ ther@@ ly sigh@@ ted , but that the j@@ aun@@ dice has been drawn to the extreme extreme .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that crossed this cultural year @-@ dra@@ ining .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration fight , of conference rooms , up to Hollywood and the devices that we keep all in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audi@@ ences of young people - who are in matters of various other than their older opponents - could be expected to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters are generated , &quot; this is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , which works as Product Manager and Engineering in Medium , is working to er@@ ase your Snap@@ chat account , calling others to do the same .
she said in an interview for medium and a telephone interview , she said that r@@ allies @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y reflect a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices of the Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu cri@@ tici@@ zed the great part white , only male leader and finishing her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t have different representation of people with other skin colours , so that they can meet such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat , mostly un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers on diversity of its staff and points to its status as private company .
on Thursday , it refused Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company has recently focused a personnel responsible , focused on under@@ lining population groups and focused on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu told that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. is . &quot;
military leadership of IS@@ IS secret information , constitutes the committee of Congress
military member of the United States Central Command imp@@ aired local information to mark an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , a committee committee of the Congress allowed in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Armed Forces , Intelligence Committee and Military bud@@ get@@ ary Council , reported that great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command &apos;s secret services , reported to clari@@ fy their ass@@ ess@@ ments to American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News service information , which were typically registered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , regularly recorded a posi@@ tional picture of American efforts towards terrorism as it had the actual conditions on site , and were consistent positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com , is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer from bad analyses to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership error in the Cent@@ Com range until the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi Armed Forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government pointed out under Obama , shows the reports to change reports , such as analysts saw the pressure of their prim@@ ates , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ sil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , comments and statements before the congress were clearly positive than it represents the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s have already begun in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city of Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can convention from Kansas , in a opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the summit of Central Command changed the retro@@ active reports to play the danger by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after they were played , analysts wor@@ ried about the manipul@@ ating from reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigations will continue .
additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are additionally by the General Insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defence in G@@ ange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Democratic Members of the news service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on Thursday their own insights that agree with the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com introduced a moder@@ ately restricted process for the creation of recent ass@@ ess@@ ments to I@@ sil and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest priority to Adam B. ship , in a opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of re@@ conn@@ aissance reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opposed the moral under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proved moder@@ ately little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence for a intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts in regard to &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through the &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General Insp@@ ector General , which were recorded after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon &apos;s premi@@ er , gave an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the convention , while investig@@ ating the general insp@@ ections were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also provided that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes certainly have asser@@ ted opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics concerning national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ating the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , during the past year , however , President Obama challenged Obama to Central Command for the military operations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the hearing information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago when an Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a font in the recommendations of many analysts at Iraq and some time looked forward by the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker had noted that Mr. Hoo@@ ker had no significant impact on the financing of the government &apos;s attacks against the terrorist organisation , since this provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
but this realization was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ ri@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the Labour for a moder@@ ately positive assessment of war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US gains fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with great Britain .
one day after they had shot three gates over Japan during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two gates in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not belonging to the people who retain their goals in memory .
they know however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are still in their group with the Brit@@ ons in their first place that remain un@@ defeated by Japan after their 2 @-@ 0 victory .
great Britain and the United States will arrive on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide on which the two teams compete in the first and second place .
the first place will take a little longer lasting from the road that leads to the other group .
as always the game will be going out on Saturday , the Americans lost a surprising Host through their success story , four years after they landed the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time a ho@@ ckey ra@@ cket in hands ( their two older sisters played the Sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , because it could not qualify for the he@@ aders .
then came the year 2012 in which she went to her team and her team .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , thus began to apply things to better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we had not the workplace in London which we now have .
we can fully tear the ru@@ in completely .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the goal in the first half of the game with a set@@ back cover .
India was without victory in the game , but the team showed surprisingly tough and kept the game stood from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until the end of the game took place in her hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the ball in the middle and lu@@ te the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the tor@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a barrel .
exactly like b@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will be on Saturday from the result of the next game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and un@@ break@@ able , a permanent relay of Staff@@ ord between competition and stri@@ ans .
the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself is a burning staff even , which will protect the swimming pool from the bracel@@ ets into tri@@ athletes .
you cannot listen to TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neigh@@ bors in the qu@@ eu@@ e in the Coff@@ es@@ hop , without knowing Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and Ch@@ ad le C@@ los .
and there &apos;s still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a Frauen@@ feld with dimples , would definitely be sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he would have a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ encing .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , strug@@ gling for gold in the Olympic trampoline .
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow , the sports , which are not generally accepted : air @-@ guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swi@@ m and may have it long .
but if I should make a modest arguments for my particular favourite , then the attention to the discre@@ te charm of the trampoline .
although the jumping event has been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it &apos;s debut in Sydney , it was so anno@@ ying , so many that I asked , I didn &apos;t know that there is a Olympics competition at all .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA was competing for competition , it never won a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and won an athl@@ ete up to 2012 , who made it up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians are able to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese , and the Canadian to divide for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend this year their gold medal from London .
the trampoline jumping has a certain outer walls , partly because it sounds the un@@ re@@ conn@@ aissance ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should ad@@ mit that I am no expert , but just a failed enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ ography of his never @-@ to @-@ end dev@@ ils - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym and pi@@ g , which combines two sports , which essentially combines .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much like &quot; dive board . &quot;
up@@ lifting winner jump on a gig@@ antic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling mo@@ tions ( turning , H@@ real and sal@@ tos ) before joining the feet .
they will be evaluated according to the official Olympic Institute for execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
branches of 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go on in their stri@@ ve after gold , qu@@ icker , walking up and down , sometimes until the finish , sometimes go back and down@@ wards on the playground .
they hunt &apos;t just the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV @-@ transmission also another cav@@ ity : the world or the Olympic champion .
the targeted stri@@ ve is Nobel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atically - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a viewer to t@@ ears .
but it &apos;s also what I think about the watch of these games as something more fatigue .
this trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline jumping rope is above .
the forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ un@@ ing , se@@ em@@ ingly he@@ avier than an ast@@ ron@@ aut , go down , then down to the top , then effortlessly back up .
also here is a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is so Zen like the competition during the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualifying and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also around 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
am@@ id@@ st the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , which will probably be over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved through the ang@@ ulation and the object of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its air @-@ ring@@ ing , new fan community .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long A Verb@@ al of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demand political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gling to violent opposition by the government .
witnesses say that heart@@ y prot@@ esters were killed during c@@ lashes with the police during c@@ uss@@ ing .
is Ethiopia just doing that ?
over the past ten years , there was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid association with a fast growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government had reno@@ unced the country , expanding into more areas .
last week , thousands of people fell on the streets and desired fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was in@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave up witnesses to shot and killed polic@@ emen on zig @-@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos on protests , probably from the last or early this year , show how security professionals suggest young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN authority for Human Rights now calls for incoming research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to meet this country , and in future , Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services closely collabor@@ ate closely with Ethiop@@ ians , to combat terrorist attacks on the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western help .
Ethiop@@ ian Economy expanded in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there &apos;s a new pend@@ ulum suit in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the Stre@@ ets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led through the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ sidents become effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or imprisoned in the prison , put to death in the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press people and do not have any other options , it breaks off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m T@@ icino , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth is prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use to cover the ruling coalition in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
following a far @-@ review election last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions along the border to Eritrea ; a struggle for this c@@ ack@@ ing , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analy@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less forced in recent years , could generate turbul@@ ences and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of delay after years of origin now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ian were able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones were ever more common and the Internet services improved .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they &apos;re in regular intervals , especially with protests , do many people still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide they arise .
several young Ethiop@@ ians reported that they gathered themselves to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ co@@ vis , Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since minist@@ ries , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from offices of mainly Christian countries , in politics and economics , while they explo@@ ited the Oro@@ sei , many Muslims are living in flat @-@ areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a guide of the Oro@@ sei . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ sei .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ sei the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the Eth@@ ical group of Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military , in trading and politics are dominant .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death at a non @-@ public @-@ owned illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister .
he was viewed as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts predic@@ t that he was particularly vulner@@ able to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundament@@ alist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .

many fears that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia lived in such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ esting , according to the government of analy@@ ser by the government and subsequently stolen .
while the following ra@@ ids were killed , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of turbul@@ ences were gone relatively quickly .
development experts pra@@ ising Ethiop@@ ian leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning , as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously this does not have prevented the intensi@@ fication of internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month &apos;s prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , from Tig@@ ray , managed business and hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray becomes ever more common in social media .
analysts predic@@ t that protests are the US and other Western allies in an independent position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for gl@@ aci@@ dic flights about the neighbouring Somalia , even if they had h@@ asted , that it closed that basis .
while the West wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to join forces in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin grey emig@@ ration &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his multiple repeated claims , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
in order to clari@@ fy new questions on the communication skills of the Presidential candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clear and understand@@ able with the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings forth his fellow worker , who would take him to protect him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to whom he could not gener@@ ously meant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having made the participation in a election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had returned to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and in@@ sist@@ ed in interviews that he really didn &apos;t int@@ end to declare the President and Mrs. Clinton in IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning call on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said it &apos;s exc@@ use serious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to destroy the testimony that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , wanted to know the republi@@ can Presidential candidate .
the last storm of criticism directed against Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to med@@ itate the focus of his campaign because of falling transition values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held Spe@@ ech@@ es in Michigan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump attempted to return to this issue .
in Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and have found their speech bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m into his defense .
at the end of July , he went strong criticism , when he meant , the Rus@@ sians received Mrs. Clin@@ &apos;s E@@ mails , but he later said &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then go back to ru@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of its ways to test , like certain messages from his fans as they arrive , and then may be clari@@ fied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think it &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that it can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of taking the sound for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even bur@@ ns , since its re@@ frac@@ tory values have gone further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour of North Carolina North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general , he must not ap@@ olog@@ ize for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expression , he accused his critic to dist@@ ress his statements , or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he has strengthened the attention of attention in the past few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps are his loy@@ al co @-@ war into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of it , like prov@@ ok@@ ingly his statements may also be his statements .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps most prominent inter@@ c@@ ession , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I think what he says is legi@@ timate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ ben@@ der , completely wrong and so it happened because he ab@@ ed the troops from Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am re@@ public@@ ans tend to ar@@ gue that the government minist@@ ered under Obama as an Minister for Foreign Minister , had allowed IS@@ IS to investigate the situation in the Middle East as aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump put his attacks on the media and threw them before , on each of his words to turn and against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They cannot be ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ cr@@ ats of Mr. Tr@@ umps regarding Mr. Tr@@ umps , than just a further evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential ministry .
once missed the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a unique café in William@@ sburg , which is only able to pay for free Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years in good coffee .
of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front has been displac@@ ed .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , set the ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap into the form of Cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people worked as last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ gu@@ ing town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but when New York is change , it is also new finding .
a restored ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began to work with ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when an client offered to provide money for a new outside place , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept many things .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ ress@@ age model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment with experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and auti@@ ous onions .
there is natural re@@ iss@@ anc@@ ake .
the café serves no beer more , there is fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez told that he had noticed a st@@ oned current of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also forced through William@@ sburg prizes , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a such customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived early in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after being drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee r@@ ink , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on coffee and in the ver@@ b , which was right in the ver@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even if they arrived at this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees form a Bl@@ ended Ch@@ ai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ standing and loy@@ al customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there in front of work and stopped always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day as a Swiss @-@ pocket watch and prepare my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with butter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he moves his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no group@@ ed in the past , that the soap business has taken the old business area .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to make a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold cooked coffee of coffee shops as ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Poland and Rodri@@ guez , said that he will present soon , so that his neigh@@ bors feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ fried coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expan@@ sive to a dis@@ b@@ art@@ ed building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favourites .
Joseph W@@ itt was regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café was closed .
when the new Café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bet@@ ting of the location and the best coffee is felt like a return .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after moving to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt had a pen@@ ch@@ ant for refined delic@@ ac@@ ies of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ t@@ les soup .
his menu on this day was somewhat modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ au@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your husband Andrew Co@@ e added &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; There was also a message to Americans that should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery stores .
Co@@ atings last book &quot; Ch@@ op Su@@ ey &quot; was the Chinese cuisine in the United States during Z@@ iegel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A gra@@ zing meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they presented culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ic@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the beginning of 1929 .
Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh sal@@ es@@ man with olive gro@@ wers while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables .
when the re@@ porter took place , this was appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a somewhat cheaper , which is scattered by the ingredient .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be in the stomach , as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ ves for male field workers and it was served fresh ro@@ asted past@@ ors for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans that sent to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; distinguishes the trails , with which the country went down to be no longer the archipelago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central , sp@@ itted theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ ets : mysterious foods such as lo@@ aves and water no@@ d@@ ules were re@@ comp@@ uted to basic food , the casserole , as &quot; wonderful kind , eating @-@ remains , &quot; mer@@ ry Z@@ iegel@@ man , because coo@@ ks could hide past@@ ry ingredients under a cold sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the focal point of the American kitchen , was too rare in a rare luxury .
strange mixtures were tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction prior to taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research on the book , which also includes recipes , bri@@ cks prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no popular addition on the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions don &apos;t fit each other .
it was typical for many business recipes .
as never before or since then , in @-@ house household waste - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the country hab@@ its of the country .
by combining recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged to become a challenge to become p@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carr@@ ots in delicious meals .

while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farms in his kitchen , he sp@@ elled as the one @-@ million@@ th man of the world , to whom he has become .
&quot; he mo@@ red continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost @-@ gil@@ ded dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was delight@@ ful real@@ ign@@ ity .
President Roosevelt might have had the same mistake , when not his wife El@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ute an ex@@ amp with his stomach .
as described in the book , An@@ chor@@ age conducted a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt , that the White House brought the long @-@ lasting food in Washington , but also one of the longest prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected once the country returned to the legs again .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man , as well as for as science was applied to food .
in writing , the pair gave to better understand the eating hab@@ its of Z@@ iegel@@ man &apos;s mother in law - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a genuine fear of food waste , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ man remembered : &quot; they actually did people sick . &quot;
there was the wind explo@@ ited .
after the plates have been clear@@ ed at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ au@@ men@@ ities , the president of Roosevelt , the south of Roosevelt ,
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that there was a common tri@@ ck to miss a fancy name .
there wasn &apos;t the cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .

he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar dedicated his life to human beings in Syria .
he ris@@ ked all that save lives .
now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died when the Assad regime has already died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Hel@@ mets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civilian control group that res@@ cu@@ ed life according to the Image @-@ Zeitung of almost 60,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game to move people from cr@@ ushed houses and to make first aid in the war .
they are the her@@ oes of war in Syria .
Om@@ ar &apos;s face was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house from the tru@@ ff@@ les of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans for the shining symbol character in the hor@@ ror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as her@@ oes , he never seen himself , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real J@@ ih@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I am dying , save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ y@@ r in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Om@@ ar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ icop@@ ters have igno@@ red four façade bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlor@@ ophyll .

Greenland : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ rates is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swimming with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks get offspring only with 150 years .
on the ground , the Greenland shar@@ pen@@ ed ends on the north of the North Atlantic , in an average of 1,@@ 220 meters far .
only when it comes down , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal accelerates at a full 2.6 km / h - and is as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this kind of lon@@ el@@ iness lifestyle seems to be a cylinder recipe for a tall age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report their findings in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commenting Alexander Sch@@ ed@@ lein at the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signi@@ fies this life span for ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the evolu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist assumed a long time that Greenland .
only lack the evidence .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks are difficult to watch , they live mainly in the ice sea , especially in the ice @-@ populated c@@ rest of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they are water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface only in winter .
researchers have correspon@@ d@@ ingly little about the lifestyle of the Greenland hair .
their Time @-@ pent@@ emp@@ o measures they set up six animals with one transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this shar@@ ks still make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
possibly ch@@ ase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the reason of the Ice Age and look for Kad@@ aver , which places higher water layers down@@ stairs down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues therefore studied 28 Greenland @-@ h@@ ates , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 as a b@@ oul@@ ders from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ metres long , while the largest 502 centimeters in diameter .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye is created already before the birth of shar@@ ks , which the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks still had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in lens core .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s as atomic @-@ aff@@ en@@ tests greater amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in contrast with 220 centimeters in length , the len@@ tic@@ ular nu@@ cle@@ us , however , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of nuclear weapons , so that in 2012 it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
in contrast to the normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities , all larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had created normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities that is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ centi@@ metre Greenland shar@@ pen@@ ance showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k should be 3@@ 92 years old during the record shar@@ k .
that Greenland @-@ females can only get offspring if they are longer than four meters , it was known .
now the researchers have been able to arrange an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ze with the multip@@ lication of at least one and a half centuries .
this could also be the world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such Meth@@ us@@ al are mainly living in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , placed on the neck of a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on pointed , was caught before Alaska .
by low temperatures often the organism also runs living animals on spar@@ king .
so they mature later - and s@@ lower s@@ lower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal warmth .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram Ele@@ ph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives dangerous and should focus on it , as possible as possible as many descendants as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Evol@@ u@@ tionary biolog@@ ist Sch@@ ro@@ lein &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big beast should still invest his resources more in a long life .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city &apos;s best opportunities to attract jobs and companies in the competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most of the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ anders , leader of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ sure whether bud@@ gets can continue to operate from London financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass it is enough to access them in the UK .
this is just big US banks .
several banks have already announced , jobs to store jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying Association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects a 10000 new work@@ places on the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the Eurozone , and further important authorities as the European insurance policy E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg , a large fund branch , cuts as well as Dublin for the infrastructure .
thanks to the great airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve .
in addition , the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ anders .
at the Seine , the rent for commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt also offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer &apos;s ranking , the city was on No.@@ 19 , Luxembourg to No.@@ 19 , Dublin , Germany , 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th .
even if life &apos;s quality is a question of pre@@ ference : &quot; with his already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; consequently the I@@ W .
however , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um .
for this purpose , the forces of power : in London , according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people were working in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives right @-@ charge from the hepatitis C Patent At@@ traction with Mer@@ ck
a US @-@ judge decided that Gilead @-@ Sciences are eligible for re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of legal costs , which are created from Hep@@ ati@@ ca C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a damages deposit amounting to $ 200 million for violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was re@@ united in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drug Sov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster of Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ l and other inhumane acts .

Clinton &apos;s earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton released its tax return on Friday , which resulted in the Presidential candidate for the Presidential Candi@@ date of Democrats and its husband of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million in Re@@ de@@ hon@@ ors ; the former Foreign Minister delivered a income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine , Virginia , published his tax returns to the last ten years with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continue to continue with regard to financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ &apos;s Kamp@@ agn@@ enh@@ el@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mit@@ i gave an opinion in a opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hi@@ ding behind false extinc@@ tions and returns to his previous promises .
it is common for US presidential candidates that publish their tax @-@ expl@@ aining , although they are not obliged by law .
tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argu@@ ed as a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al to the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Cohen , Tr@@ umps Special advisor to CN@@ N said that he didn &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to publish a bit before tax insp@@ ections are not concluded .
Tr@@ umps Cri@@ tics , among other things , also the republi@@ can Presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already leaves that his ref@@ us@@ al issues relating to assets , its donations for char@@ itable organisations , its business partners and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already been over@@ thrown on the subject and will publish a video on the Internet in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax declaration .
on Thursday , the subject spoke also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do that any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that tr@@ ump has paid for two years or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers that could still be the case .
Federal authorities have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that would ensure that people would pay a tax rate of at least 30 % after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ et .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ kshire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate has his seat to exchange tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their tax ev@@ asion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also subjected to a control panel of the IRS , and I have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before v@@ oters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has with@@ drawn tax return to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , live on average for an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax statement of the 2015 Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that it was only USD 100 their income as a reward , unlike most of all Americans .
its main monetary system was an affordable index fund from which the Clin@@ &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 was controlled .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director disin@@ teg@@ rates Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ bund@@ led a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ fix , since it had requested Arabic guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Shoah &quot; made his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotels .
however , the country was not listed among countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel rooms .
what is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , eliminated that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via an own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the reception of the hotel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer , which he received , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel had said that the measure has been a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that behind it , dissolved in the director even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix was er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Israeli Ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were aston@@ ished and troubled by this event .
that is really very comfor@@ ting .
the fact that this has carried out in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , even greater shame is even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect that the Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dissolved a quite large reson@@ ance on the Internet in which people called for a sc@@ andal .
some under@@ min@@ ed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given the alleged ex@@ changes of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compens@@ ate you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located on the very sensitive Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all charges of himself and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ sight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not include the quick@@ set list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker from the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds , that the country code has been added .

Russia &amp; Iran trade is suddenly rising to 71 % - RT Business
according to the sanctions imposed by the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions imposed against Iran , interest in sites of Russian companies grew strongly in the country , divided by amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
naturally , the further commercial construction is one of the largest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 % compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports climbed by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade down@@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
last year the Russian foreign particip@@ ations around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , came to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affects the tourist number in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists can be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Rus@@ sians visit Iran , somewhat , from which the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gr@@ otto Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home , when Br@@ ite Gold tries to win
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in the male team @-@ car in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory , when the British team def@@ ends the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ standing role that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y went to E@@ y , and made the legend hau@@ gh@@ ed for a victory over the New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the tri@@ ck after they took place in March at the train World Championships in London despite the back@@ section Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driving Jamie Staff .
they did just as execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement a gap produced by K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they remained , when they saw the potential in the vill@@ i , which now un@@ fol@@ ds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - that consisted of four years with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner sat down into the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ings winning the New Ze@@ al@@ anders in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
there was almost back after his turn , but Kenn@@ y stopped the team forward and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy changes made a large part of transformation , at the execution of a higher gear to slow it down and to make Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at the BBC expert from his position as BBC expert , Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ doo fell on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a sh@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and make me a name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final round , we set up a Olympic champion and defeated the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there was a weak start confi@@ d@@ ently to the railway .
he later returned this statement later , and there was no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
for such a victory there was no such problem for this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Behin@@ d the entire UK flags of the grand@@ stand like London &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the last three months as a team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are so bad with so many world tit@@ els so it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an event , a gold medal for the Nation that won seven of 10 tracks both in Beijing and London .
if this is a cash flow of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the Form Kenn@@ ys it is in the area of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the me of Ho@@ y equals .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels some in@@ tim@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be defeated to the kn@@ ight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts competition of the day , but there were another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ke W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the World Record , who won Gold in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of competition , with the focus on W@@ ig@@ gins .
he was cont@@ ested yesterday with representatives of quali@@ fications , as officials to call him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , tomorrow continued and terminated , av@@ anc@@ ake Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Arch@@ ib@@ ald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the UK team is leaving its strong platform team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a shot at medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute dom@@ ination in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down .
it played drums in the background , as the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April am@@ id@@ st the after@@ mat@@ h of sex@@ ism and Mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ so@@ ils as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ o@@ drome , the legendary reputation of GB@@ S , which reaches its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the m@@ elt of Portland by increasing the energy contract
the future of the aluminum mil@@ king of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at the game since the system operators shall announce the energy agreement and in order to provide all delivery jobs as well as the supplying energy company .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operation the plant .
a sub@@ sid@@ y is scheduled for 20 years in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland are standing on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be endanger@@ ed at a closing time .
in addition , it could become dom@@ ino effects , as the m@@ elt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point Henry M@@ elt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the m@@ elt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and risk a closure .
this step follows the year @-@ long spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a consequence of the Australian Dollars and most recently due to the electricity price .
AG@@ L , which delivers the big aluminium sm@@ ashing with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told that three other owners will run their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority owned by a joint venture between AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp will hold smaller shares .
AG@@ L comes from that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity through m@@ elt , &quot; shared the company .
AG@@ L still said that the contracts were called &quot; securing transactions &quot; that would have been in force since November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of period so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L goes out of that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong dates for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L told that the value of contracts concluded in its annual slu@@ dge of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to make the contracts to make the &quot; Sk@@ ill Alco@@ as ... the m@@ elt or the power supply to ensure &quot; not imp@@ aired .
the U.S. company said that it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang that would have been in power by November this year , even though it is still a statement , why it came down from the contract .
analy@@ st thanks to the bad economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of the Portland m@@ elt in Victoria and Tom@@ ago facility close to Newcastle .
referring to the statements of the analy@@ st in the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mic@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland consume about 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ watts .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said .

the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Card@@ as@@ hi@@ ans ) , as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ biz and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn , as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as well as the cover of their sister : you have planned to plan all a surprise @-@ party season .
this represents almost every birth@@ days of a child dispatch ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kri@@ s had to participate in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the V@@ ogue , security has started a new era of car@@ dan shafts .
Kend@@ al big sister Kim likes them what the V@@ ogue cover goes , beaten ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league .
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for V@@ ogue .
with a circum@@ ference that res@@ embles a photo band as a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut @-@ Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) from the 8@@ 32 pages of the ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of its Co@@ ver@@ stars are expected to see that in the last two years of the journal , the journal is un@@ related to official announcement .
women who were already on the cover already include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner &apos;s lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga the honor had honor .
but even with the low chance that Ms J@@ enner - which is described by the peri@@ odi@@ cal as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under the previous category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related with famous people related or reality stars or you@@ ths of today , who know how to watch a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is hop@@ ing for yo@@ bi@@ kers ) .
they are really talented women that character@@ ize in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always somewhat cl@@ amped in the fashion world .
in June , the unanim@@ ous Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues from Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and her colleagues called &quot; the Mist@@ ake of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings come again high , when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but to turn on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to be stopped at the point .
Antonio J@@ enner is based on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your gro@@ unding of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you images of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
you are sold by Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers offer 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief providers are rejected annually by the municipal centers , while the industry accounts for the impact of further mid @-@ shortest transactions .
in Queens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ true del@@ og@@ ations and similar rights - at their request for free legal consultancy and legal entities .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ crow@@ ded , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , the legal centres will lose further 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the municipal centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell told that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Center , which resulted in tens of thousands of people every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a repe@@ al of the decision of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ land Municipal coun@@ ties are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and pressed debt , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems legal way and this survey shows that they don &apos;t need the assistance that they need .
the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpful people from Queens@@ land will be forced to help with their legal issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the Federal Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Justice and Federal Minister of Justice of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis who will immediately withdraw this medium , so that people need help to obtain under legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the national government had its promises to raise funds for rec@@ tan@@ gles to the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of communal centers and their customer communities as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work .

&quot; weapons must not be fired , to den@@ si@@ ties damage , &quot; gave B@@ ord@@ i .
the acc@@ us@@ ation occurs only two days after the republi@@ can Presidential candidate , said that &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; said that &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; should take action , if his ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton elected and appoint judges .
Tr@@ umps is clear that the media had torn his words from the context , and that he would not make violence against violence .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of the country @-@ election : SPD and the CDU
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , substantial losses for the SPD and the CDU continue .
this received representative surveys of Outlook Research Institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black coalition coalition can continue to continue in the north , this is not possible after the demand in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would have been the strongest party , thereby making good chances to present the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party will only be just under the CDU , which could return to 23 per cent .
third place is fought between the left and the AF@@ D .
the lens bears 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would represent 19 percent of the first time in the Parliament .
the Gre@@ ens are hes@@ it@@ ated despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) once again in the Schwerin Parliament .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented in the Parliament with 3 percent each .
according to the members of the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD in the survey was still only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
thus , they are still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D would represent 14 percent of the first time at the dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return soon , pir@@ ates would not miss in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator assembled on the market .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ ly and bigger , it wasn &apos;t good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite cum@@ ulated .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , that would be sufficient for approximately two sel@@ fish with high resolution .
a iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can still buy tools in the internet , but they origin@@ ate somehow from the Stone Age of Internet paper .
however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received via fax was the Communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser if too , too , too .
a pocket calculator is available , an digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the phone could be turned out like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the prize was quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , so it was about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price for smartphones in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to pass in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell division experienced an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , was finally sold and wrapped in Microsoft .
today , suppliers domin@@ ate the market today , which were all much later than Nokia .
to be online and everywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ running business of countless app vend@@ ors and telecommunications corporations are coming .
a whole of around the smartphone has been created in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then the Apple b@@ oss Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , one phone and an Internet communications , all via touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ ant success began , today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the night .
eventually they disappeared , Black@@ berry has strug@@ gling to fight .
the passages now have Apple and Asian vend@@ ors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ intellig@@ ibility for 20 years after his invention .
on average , each Deutsche Telekom currently watch 88 times a day on its mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to be able to drive the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now applicable as a curse and blessing .
England needs to guide the Olympic spirit and bro@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only supported in our local communities and throughout London , but in all the country e@@ wing and prosper@@ ity .
for me , the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ rows sold , just as in 2012 in London , as we had a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will achieve again by making new opportunities for local @-@ resident and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we have already been able to create 10,000 new jobs , 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment will be an end .
as for us in London 2012 , there will be such a thing that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows are too big .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and we will be able to bl@@ ame us on the world stage .
the dou@@ bl@@ ers had de@@ pri@@ ved in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles for over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every man asked question .
like the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
the extension is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in we@@ ath@@ ering growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row that has chosen a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme from T5 , which was chosen five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the heart of the world &apos;s two @-@ frequ@@ ented balance bike .
now they are ready to deliver a third running time , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we bro@@ aden this Olympic spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ ole@@ um &quot; regarding ad blo@@ cked
for companies that earn money advertising attempts according to one of the software manufacturers , advertising blocking , &quot; a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would blo@@ cked ad blo@@ ws on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus would update a blo@@ g@@ post in which users could update their filters to block their filters in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook was dealt with that his des@@ kt@@ y would change the coding regarding its advertising display , in order to identify the adver@@ ts that part of the site advertising is to be troubled .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to move the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle has been on display between the upcoming Open Source Community and the envelop@@ ers already since the invention of ad @-@ b@@ los@@ ers in the g@@ ange , &quot; and that it &apos;s possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has left in the struggle , is a powerful indi@@ z that has become a wor@@ r@@ ying display panel for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people use the adver@@ t@@ rophy ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook about their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ ving makes 84 percent of the advertis@@ ed fac@@ ebook .
the company has found it on display block@@ ers on desktop PCs which have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenue , so Facebook seems that the investment of such a stri@@ de is worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook was dealt with that it would update its &quot; ad @-@ called &quot; display tool &quot; to have more control over it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed to concern the new filters , because they would also block content on the page that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to arrange the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shared the problem of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad blo@@ gs are a st@@ ump means that we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control over the hands of the people .
woman with suspected self @-@ suicide on Swiss highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected self @-@ suicide of several vehicles on an auto@@ bahn .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman rose in the Dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police spoke in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss @-@ born @-@ in at the age of 49 , which was driven by several trucks , including a load of trucks , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been ques@@ tioned , but some are still not identified , the police , which , as well as each voucher of the incident .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Mr Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter granted the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait , whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a c@@ lash avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not drawn to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers didn &apos;t want to go out in the middle of the night , as it was named in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ e@@ woman is acqu@@ itted of neg@@ lig@@ ent killing , after having killed a man and killed one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had dr@@ unk , and has become un@@ conscious of the street .
the court stated that the polic@@ e@@ woman calls for a justified manner -- on a justified fashion , and that the presence of a man on the street was an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judges .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday close to Morges should sign up at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably un@@ inhabit@@ able according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms which res@@ emble climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere could once inher@@ ited similar conditions .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere , and still slowly turning .
the model illuminated also the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably proved more dry @-@ oppos@@ ites than the earth , but had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and con@@ serv@@ iced on qu@@ icker evap@@ oration .
early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus exp@@ on@@ ates their daily side of the sun for almost two months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS Scienti@@ st Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a news release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that affects a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of much of the sunlight .
the result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus that res@@ embles evolution that was suspected of planetary research .
although it was probably supposed to be li@@ vable , the Venus -- in the course of the years --@@ zu@@ n heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was fired off by ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers believed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy joins the Aval@@ an@@ che coach
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and introduced a decision to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ad@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy has expressed its opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I thought in the summer and much thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth and bring it to higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of Trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a decision to determine who influence the team &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had arrived to Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Adams Awards .
he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed within each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot at the Western Conference by five points .

Nor@@ des@@ e@@ e@@ ö@@ lar@@ er join talks back , strike strikes out
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea oils are exposed , while all armed parties are set for a new round table on the table , said negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions , that we have agreed to re@@ launch the winding process of the current stre@@ ites , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some full day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next next year to rest@@ art problems .
the unions said that its last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible pay@@ roll payments of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group has shortened this year to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s ratings were followed by a 10 @-@ percent drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional reductions in the company needed the required space to get through market down@@ turn .
shell has released for its part of thousands of people and have announced plans to stop its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as a result of its business activities , as a result of its mega @-@ flame expansion with the British energy company BG Group .
due to their lower cru@@ de oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation , which was decided by the British decision in June to aband@@ on the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament , Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers leaders to discuss one of the greatest work disputes since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion spending will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler World teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers help collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ads .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in star cluster on different inst@@ al@@ ments , as well as in which related areas of rotation with the planet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that at the same time , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a news release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 445 light@@ years from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster , which emerged about 125 million years ago , can now reach adul@@ thood .
it now turning the fastest .
to peak load rates , this tri@@ pled stars gain large amounts of star@@ ters .
as this win@@ ch goes through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
if a star is al@@ tert , his rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by acknowled@@ ging the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ zable star spot -- such as sun@@ spot -- recognis@@ es .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational points indicates that massive more massive stars can be lower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull res@@ embles the stars with dancers , with bigger than larger stars s@@ lower than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we see that slow @-@ wave rot@@ ors should tend to be massive , whereas faster rotor blades to be higher , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare qualities of rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cluster of Ple@@ j@@ ads offers anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is much more to know what we want to learn more about how , When , and why stars lost their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ bel and her colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the astronom@@ ical Journal .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the field was so controversial , its occurrence is outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first Dop@@ pler cases
caught : due to a positive Dop@@ pler Sample , Wei@@ ght@@ li@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ts .
a caught party would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day the first official d@@ op@@ ho@@ res became known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obst@@ acle in Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive and excluded immediately before the start of the oh@@ ist@@ le athle@@ tics competition .
in Ch@@ en , this last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been demonstrated , which is used as a massive means of Dop@@ pler sub@@ stan@@ cies .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court in CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the finals over 100 m Butterfly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the prec@@ urs@@ or over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association taking the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will collabor@@ ate with the International Sport Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IOC will not be responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes by positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an unbelievable shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the lightweight shooter .
according to the report it should act in the banned substance to act the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ stuffs EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was provision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should have been positively extinct .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w critic@@ ised immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ ali@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men go not the right battles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians have been under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , about all weight of wei@@ ght@@ li@@ ds from the chron@@ ically @-@ op@@ ted nation could not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known as the London Olympic champion in the class of up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested positive on the an@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both cont@@ ests that both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is particularly serious blow for the reputation of the whole sports art .
the World Federation IA@@ AF had not permitted the complete Russian squ@@ ad to the start because of systematic d@@ op@@ ings , the Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , former tre@@ ach@@ ments were cat@@ ered in China for heavy disputes between the athletes .
thus the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt Purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun stood at the centre of a con@@ frontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping fu@@ gi@@ ers , &quot; said this .
sun was tested positive in 2014 with the Chinese championships positively on the stim@@ ulus of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
datas@@ he@@ lau : how per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ s@@ om
programmer by Er@@ press@@ ungs @-@ Malware are up @-@ to @-@ date companies and are successful .
according to a current survey of the malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies have been at least once , partially with multiple victims of a pres@@ tige software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a ran@@ som@@ atic press@@ room .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to re@@ compens@@ ate by the perpet@@ rators required by the perpet@@ rators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their compression software according to the observations of Par@@ eto@@ Logic &apos;s observations at the company &apos;s premises .
if they &apos;re successful there , the potential @-@ saving soldering tip falls significantly higher than for individuals .
&quot; we currently observe a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes @-@ chief Marc@@ in Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ p@@ olls still have been designed to send advertising .
then the Daily press software discovered itself .
only private use to the goal , however , the change to company attacks was overwhelming in the past months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , she sear@@ ches specifically for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos .
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software will then be presenting the demands of the press .
to get the final turn@@ key code to get files , the victims have to have money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ si@@ tional Bit@@ coin - sur@@ render .
but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , there are companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage drops off if a ran@@ som@@ ware goes .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported in net loss by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to completely break business activities , in case of a fall , people were in life .
in Germany , several hospitals had already been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by loss of acute acute ac@@ utely .
&quot; we say the victims always : paying not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay , get their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to appro@@ ve the demand for perpet@@ rators in the operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the Security for@@ scher of F @-@ Secure investig@@ ates the use of user interfaces and to the results : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to form a type of customer service to take more money .
you explain your victims by chat as you can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free @-@ to @-@ access support websites or dec@@ ryp@@ ting free example files .
and will rede@@ em individuals after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must pay partly hard @-@ negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get lost their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware Er@@ press@@ ors , the h@@ acker will always be professional and share of the antivirus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write an ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
the probability is , however , that it is about three or four persons .
the programmers sell their dam@@ aging software into the form of a software construction to the actual creation .
the previous malware kits were created by malware , consulting and additional tools for a single @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the press @-@ presses are then looking for further h@@ acker to spread the fresh@@ ly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
thus , in one of the forums on the Underground , the set of a crimin@@ als , and commissioned a further way to install the software on as possible .
payment is per in@@ adequate computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crimin@@ als apply then sp@@ ammer to the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is known now with many companies that secure their data .
over 50 per cent of companies responsible for the IT @-@ IT data processors have confidence in the Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators pursue new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful recovery , instead , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ eto@@ Logic @-@ b@@ oss , Marc@@ in Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the damage potential , depending on the type of data by a more multiple higher than before .
too , the perpet@@ rators could now take completely new goals in the internet of things .
during the h@@ ack@@ er@@ conference def@@ aults , security researchers demonstrated how to get a controlled thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the connecting of a der@@ art blo@@ cked heating so man@@ ned sacrifice could be worth a ran@@ s@@ om value .
if the Daily later blocks a whole production street in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in the industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
it sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V works rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first line and in the rear , it works in any place .
materials of the interior space are well @-@ processed and are pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top falls off there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
it is not just a boot space of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ quality and 10@@ 26 l when working with back backs , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically , as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be set up like pul@@ leys and provide storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high .
the boot space can be loaded well , but the charging height is 650 mm somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp will accelerate the HR V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of speeds .
he would like to raise his work somewhat more quiet .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another motor is still available : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be somewhat direct .
in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; the equipment can be desired to be desired .
the city @-@ emergency assistant belongs to the security systems ( works at speeds 32 ) , the precision warning system and the trace assistance .
sometimes , the coll@@ ision warning shr@@ ines sometimes , because it has been assessed by many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ating objects . &quot;
the remote care works very reliably .
and the intelligent Tem@@ po@@ regulator re@@ acts to traffic sign recognition and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t when needed .
the full connectivity is only available for top features : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI socket are below the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat controversial .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are all right .
those who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 euros , the diesel starting from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday suit@@ ably car .
Airline is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger bridge
it is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the air@@ lift .
the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) shall be argu@@ ed for any liability whatsoever that are typical of air traffic .
the sm@@ iling had broken at the fall of a kne@@ ading .
however , the accident could happen everywhere - it &apos;s a common risk of life , as the dish .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
disease case : when paid the organizer
after their journey , only money will get money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel .
this is , however , only the case if more than ten percent of the guests will show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family on the second day of their Turkish lau@@ rel was severely affected by di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their disease did the vac@@ ation@@ ers on a def@@ ective swe@@ ating situation , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey was so poor - and def@@ endants against the promot@@ ers .
K@@ lä@@ ger had no success before the court .
although the wast@@ e@@ water was indeed def@@ ective .
but the organizer reserves just before departure of the sm@@ iling .
he had to go out until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he didn &apos;t h@@ urt his information , so the judgment .
especially contaminated in the samples of water are not found im@@ pur@@ ities .
the disease of several hotel guests - perhaps due to infection amongst themselves - belonging to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violence dealt by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people had care for further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we will not treat the terror@@ ists .
if offen@@ ders have to leave the country , but the safety and strength is also the consent of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of proposals by 2017 in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another staff of personnel forces , namely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ sized orders for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ise for terrorism again under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , which is ce@@ ased to be amended , above all the purchase of weapons in the Internet .
the last much @-@ discussed silence for doctors shall remain uncer@@ tain according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , in dialogue with a stum@@ bling @-@ shaft , he wants to be reduced to solutions such as endanger@@ ing citizens , he said with views of mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister keeps a better social support for necessary .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD head Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is willing to talk about everything which aims to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior ministers clear against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear@@ cher for the Shar@@ p@@ macher in the CDU / CS@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka prohibition and ab@@ oli@@ tion of double nationality .

repair traffic flow at the motorway junction
there is regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the right split will be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers , who are standing in professional traffic on the surrounding road every night in St@@ au when they drive over the motorway E@@ Zub@@ r@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction renewed on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Street to the right de@@ fl@@ ation lane by 700 meters .
auto@@ driver can then be inserted directly from the hammer road to the right .
the major advantage : the traffic divi@@ des at the earliest , thereby improving the Total ascent of the Bundes@@ straße 51 in the most popular section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the tram@@ way on the Zub@@ r@@ inger nervous the drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back@@ drop until the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h path and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the neck watch on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Street .
from here traffic will only be guided by the motorway bridge via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built well in the three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had result that the bridge has no more the required lifting force , in order to absor@@ b the heavy traffic haz@@ ard .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related St@@ au will continue to say , the competent authorities can &apos;t say .
however it is expected to calculate with years : for the bridge has an official resi@@ dual use of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the right hand , the regional company deliber@@ ately deliber@@ ately picked up the traffic period during school holidays , because with disabilities .
traffic is passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday arrived at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : Culture Offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young Theatre are planning a music project now .
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s allows adolescents with mig@@ rat@@ - and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule &apos;s House has visited an introduction of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Young The@@ aters Münster .
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; association , 19 students between eleven and 15 years now visited the st@@ aging in the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set up cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit the project cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the young people in the class were from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and the little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ies , the scen@@ ic pictures and video anim@@ ations , it was possible to follow the action course , so the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .
the Association N@@ IMA &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming game of a music theatre project .
from October to December you@@ ths will receive young people with and without a flight and migration background between 14 and 20 years , professionally trained courses in the fields of singing , dance , play and music .
the offers for children and families in the field of theater play and theat@@ rical language transmission are planning in the planning .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; project goes on .
given the increased number of refugees , the association expects to participate in many classes .
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope of weather forecast
the weather in the southwest of Germany in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday one stroke through the bill - but there is hope yet .
the night was bad because of clouds and rain so bad for it , the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many star cli@@ ffs at the sky .
this is a Per@@ form , which belong to the fastest star section with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
their names have they , because they se@@ em@@ ingly come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against ins@@ om@@ nia
in the evening you reach forever , at night there is time for hour @-@ long , in the morning , already far ahead of the wake @-@ ring@@ ing so@@ ck@@ les no longer think of sleep .
that is anything but relaxing .
after all , you have problems with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one @-@ quarter of adult sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently recovered .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and they can underlying them various causes , emphasi@@ zes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , board member of the German Society for Schla@@ ering and sleep medicine .
what kind of things under@@ stands , however , the In@@ som@@ nia is never distur@@ bing , thus an inputs and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
just that can sleep well as un@@ satisfactory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , board member of the German household association with practice in Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
behind it can include organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors , but also to stick drugs .
not rare is the ins@@ ul@@ sion expression of an other disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake up is often found in depression &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that several factors ab@@ alls each other .
who for example has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly lie , aw@@ akes every two to three hours and starts wom@@ ens to sal@@ v@@ els about everyday problems and provide an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep ins@@ om@@ nia ?
who does not sleep over a month of at least three nights per week , and may not be affected by the day , should consult a doctor .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ interrupted , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to prevent sleep distur@@ bing , it is important to find their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , co@@ gni@@ tive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic wooden tablets only in case of emergency and maximum for two weeks .
in Germany , there are hardly any ins@@ ul@@ ent sleeping in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleep problems , you should first contact the physician , s@@ own We@@ e@@ ß .
the problems may clari@@ fy , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should happen to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for example , in sleep laboratory , medical profession allows for example with car@@ esses with respiratory sick@@ ness , in case of sick@@ ness or if you don &apos;t distur@@ b the cause of a sleep distur@@ b .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a lunch break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after sli@@ pping , one goes into the bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes , one carries a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ el@@ ler on the finger .
furthermore , a camera for the ceiling is characterized by the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers of problems arise in the handle ?
there are quite lots of pitch , in which one can put for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping and standing times , not to sleep in bed , on the day not sleep , not watching television to sleep , alcohol do not start at night - then you start at night - and that &apos;s all and not favor@@ ably .
what the jung@@ le camp with lack of medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he had brought gold for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protecting from the former ex @-@ team mate to the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where a Olympic Champion paid 20,000 € &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a j@@ ung@@ el@@ kö@@ nig was $ 150,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody wrote about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on Friday at his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funding system in the swimming sport is bad , the Dop@@ pler controls are very good .
thus , we cannot compete with countries which promote very much and do not even use the topic D@@ oping not exactly or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls should be set out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;

airport : Ban@@ de of Lu@@ ggage Storage
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at Düsseldorf Airport
civil servants of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ icious had committed as ban@@ de several pocket and baggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock civil servants recognized a ban@@ de in the area of the Airport Düsseldorf to visit the polic@@ emen from last theft .
the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acy since mid @-@ July this year and were gener@@ alized , working @-@ minded and particularly professionally .
the number of experts from the crime of 34 can have travelled the th@@ ie@@ ves to have travelled to Germany to prove four actions .
altogether it took more than 15,000 Euro .
Alt@@ built altars , a few left @-@ bro@@ oks , inter@@ ro@@ gated by a rest h@@ amp@@ le@@ ep : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain seems at the first sight , but the police ranks among the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
go down the road from east to west along the street , a refreshing kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades are over .
someone is spra@@ yed at the façade of a gray house ! &quot; spec@@ kl@@ ed . &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , it will be built until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article on this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which calls for Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , however , are preferred by burning cars during the past few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of rental contracts , in the ground floor , are still occupied spaces and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator had several times for a hard prevention of police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , had been clear@@ ed with 300 police officers , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , un@@ locked parts of the road and held visitors to the house with the number 94 .
in the currency of the newly renovated building workers on behalf of unknown home@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the spati@@ ality was illegal , and one day later police and construction workers under the ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road looks peaceful : parents are walking with children , men sit on the side@@ walks in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain a pre@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there are elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many people : Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in the Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , who separated three children , mostly from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the hood , they share their concern in rising ten@@ ants and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sounds like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to get a majority of political protection against the left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ sion and the police are up@@ set between squ@@ at@@ ters and their neighbours , obviously doesn &apos;t exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Berlin actually was a traditional working quarter , which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average and high ar@@ sen@@ ic risk .
many houses and bor@@ n@@ atives have already been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in former DDR ( GDR ) , including almost the entire main@@ board street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the mainstre@@ am had been clear@@ ed under large police authorities , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are inhabited by people still occupied by people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly become mag@@ nets for tourists and sel@@ ector lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them , residents of GDR times and former home@@ ters share their Kie@@ z .
this has also been notic@@ e@@ ably noticeable , which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings will be attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them with stran@@ ded slices or fresh@@ ly coated faç@@ ades that were thrown with color explo@@ res .
no other road was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reason that all neigh@@ bors could not be seen as problem , that they don &apos;t imp@@ ly imp@@ ly affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences like body injuries is almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest part of the criminal charges make non @-@ damage , the ten@@ dencies rather the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , cannot be any speech .
what acts of violence is important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who don &apos;t have been known .
also the famous burning cars will give it directly to the Rig@@ a@@ er longer .
for studying archit@@ ec@@ tin , her road is no criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; here it helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than wo@@ different . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consci@@ ously moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße .
therefore it was so important that the inhabitants returned to their road : from the police , politics and the media , all suddenly stressed the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : due to secure new buildings , the old inhabitants will push off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums which are not interesting for many are here - here are people who are not so well toler@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I cannot be gu@@ ei@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should I do if a never any@@ body listen to ?
on all sides , fru@@ str@@ ation focuses on all sides , also with the police and residents .
for her drawn , Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the hood and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who is moving , should be aware of that - just like any one who moves into a pub , so bad about noise can be blow@@ n there .

Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the administration team of Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , workers , refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else !
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are gr@@ ate@@ ful more than than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now that there is a busy Woll@@ l@@ actic , which above all has a problem .
so some - less mo@@ ck@@ ingly experienced a lot on the wide variety of business areas - meant that the administration wanted to write the site .
sought a board of management with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long@@ standing experience in the area of social work , just a busy Woll@@ sm@@ chs@@ au .
however , administrative labor is not its central area , means An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , around organization , work with people on site and even behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been doing so for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Hon@@ or and main stakeholders are supported .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and comprehen@@ sion problems .
new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße stand soon
a serious problem has been to be found since some time , apartments for connecting flights have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection output .
they must teach refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities itself .
the responsibility change from the council , the commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to the administration does not find private apartments .
until now , it is not working on private apartments , so Deu@@ t .
therefore , private apartments must be in@@ famous , as it is so beautiful .
so , new containers will soon be positioned in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
Per@@ spective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le are log@@ ged in .
in addition to a firm lead , training places , training places , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and foreign aid to refugees and migrants who have to be arranged or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports reg@@ ine .
many works in the building yard or help House@@ hold , char@@ itable work - and the mo@@ tiv@@ ate and very ne@@ at , like An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the building leads to a positive external impact .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
worked , however , does not only work .
the day require a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sen@@ i@@ ority .
so there are offerings such as sports , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses .
professional courses are rar .
this also jump here administration and honorary volunteers .
it is centrally that the refugees get the feeling to be desired and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it takes to pass it and brid@@ ged the time , for example with language courses .
whoever knows the feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach doesn &apos;t work , and be un@@ profitable , who will never go .
the clear majority was motivated .
problem cases , however , says customer hon@@ est , &quot; people , in which even nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is therefore always to mo@@ tiv@@ ate others too .
all that is already a &quot; mamm@@ ary task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two be afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine is quite clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack of n@@ ai@@ v will call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resi@@ dual risk , however , would not exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed , the hel@@ per is already .
this incid@@ ents are subject to the refugees too .
they w@@ ished the fear that the terrorist attacks in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary volunteers must be placed on site and in the region after activities .
in the background , they always have a new impact on refugees and migrants coming to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
this question is clear to answer the policy .
actually , it is un@@ fair to introduce them to the place .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there , where we would like , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already fully explo@@ ited to integrate the previous human beings .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need of poverty , both women are able to help them .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
chim@@ ney : bur@@ gl@@ ed with hel@@ icop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew different areas for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are compulsory on Friday morning at 8.50 o &apos;clock in a dwelling place in a multi @-@ family house .
the inhabitants surprised the two , and smote the un@@ hol@@ den in the escape .
the two men were approximately 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ lis .
they fled towards the city centre .
to the flag@@ staff , the police put several strikes and a police helicopter .
the flag@@ staff ran without success .
possibly the in@@ famous before the hab@@ itation fell near the apartment and with her escape .
