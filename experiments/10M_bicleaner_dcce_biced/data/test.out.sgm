<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreements - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are, however, in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>

<seg id="9">He will establish regulations massively, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for individuals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has established particular tasks to open the disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>

<seg id="23">TPP, the body-fish trade agreement, both don't want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both don't want to isolate the US from international trade - but just keep American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">The should then be paid better, calls for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger-wages.</seg>

<seg id="28">What is going to do in this question is not clear: once he says, the minimum wage must arise, then he says he shall not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">At one side, trump, which wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critic adheres to him, that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women sitting.</seg>

<seg id="31">Even here, women in refugee advice would be regarded as inferior and worst if used.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to that about 90 per cent of women who live in the North of Munich, are traumatized.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was an gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and proclaim the official end of the words and economic sanctions during the end of eight months.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as Vladimir Putin won his Turkish counterpart in the gilded Hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in a gilded room, I can't protect myself from pressure, that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the envelope, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putting smile worked dirty and he radiated hardly warmth, even for its restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke about his "loving friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to its old level before the crisis, but even further improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">Next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have thought that Erdogan would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to suggest my enthusiasm to the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustained, showed that Russia's state of Russia had nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of crisis has been the first thing which he mentioned in his introductory statement: the shooting of a Russian fight aircraft on Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin distributed and accused Ankara to please the back in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Leaving was even bigger, as it was committed by a supper friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrauen will rebuild up again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a fiery, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed as would carry the Turks to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "at the serious adverse officials, Erdogan's family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the president Erdogan's excuse, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind win.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice is clear in hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily all the friends who he can get from a failed coup d "état that he had failed during the last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">He repeated terror attacks on Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions strongly met Turkey - especially the ban of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They belong to the Mediterranean Sea on a late afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the public TV set aside fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is wounding to the West since its reaction to the tried feasibility was considered a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this, the sustained impact on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pivetousness is to move from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian leader won a claim that he asked for the elected coup d "état of support for the chosen state of state.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's well-established for Moscow, self-intelligibility, which himself has a deep fear of raiment.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the summit in this beautiful Palace on the sea allowed it Russia and Turkey, as it once described a analyst," "" "Allianz from outside the side" "" ": two countries that stumble from the west and are poorly treated." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as peace stickers, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents appear on the press conference that they would not have been striped.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey cancelled it clearly on a question about their differences, while Putin was decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "there is no clear consensus, where a common denominator can be found in Syria." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potentials for a perfect dispatement, as the NATO member turns Turkey's martial martial, it is certainly better that the two heads of heads speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed a special representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of Kremlin it is that Putin has arranged Putin without stating reasons "the dismissal of Ivanovs ordered by his duties as chairman of the Russian presidiary office."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was a deputy chairman since 2012 was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated in the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he was later becoming a protocol director and director of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "on his appointment he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of government to support their activity as head of law and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared Russian TV broadcasted on Friday with IVANOV asked that IVANOV asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey IVANOV was a long time one of the most engined confidentiality Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, it was broadcasted on TV, both males claimed that the Chief of Staff has withdrawn at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, there are only few of them - especially ahead of the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody is nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once appeared as potential president, who wants to forward Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, quoted on the Website of the Kremlin, IVANOV, "It's true that I asked you to trust in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - it could almost say - complaining in four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it asks, I have been chairman of the Russian presidiary for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, as Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin was going to power to power, he called IVANOV as one of five people, whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was assuming that IVANOV could be President of Russia's second term of office, as a third term of Putin would have lost its constitution against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally's allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Minister-President before he was again president of the President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the flow between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a native activity which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and Green: investors shall be much stronger in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">First line is about the question: who should actually build the favorable apartments?</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating, how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child can't go without outdoors, but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens up for rigid, was sued in the last decade of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go, it is therefore about to get people from the sofa and to be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and activities are not interconnecting to each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am looking forward to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a app that is based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later it emerged from a cartoon-series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank during the publication of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smartphones go outside and looking for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS, once they were found once, "photographed" (on a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the guard and sprang up for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which reduces the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardio, an app for Apple Watch, which followed up for 35,000 users, followed by Washington Post, announced that within two days after the market launch of the game, the number of followed people train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it simply looks the raw data for performance improvement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health, people who want to bring about 30 minutes to take away, "from the sofa to come" and "every day they're working on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look forward.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances to climb from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of advantages, which is too long to conduct them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also worsenic toys which must always be surprised.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even when phone apps like Fitbit could follow earlier our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new one will lose his maturity and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success, however, more games will be combined to combine apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world, and so many people will be helping the hunt to be active, itter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">19-year old American Turnerin erklomm on Thursday for multi-championship titles and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly seen in front of silver medal winner and "Final Five" teams in Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze medal winner in Aliya Mustina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American Simone Biles turf at the Swedish ballet for women in the gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-championship title, and a total of the fifth, while they consolidate their reputation, the best of its generation or even ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke in tears when her end result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success set them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world-medals, including 10 gold medals, which includes a mixture of ambition and precision, that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said that she ever saw "the best gymnast that I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was an last examination in Brazil, a contest, which was not so much between Biles and the rest of athletes, but rather, between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American singers Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman surtted after they have won gold and silver in the single competition of women in the gymnastics at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles picked up the first Medal on Tuesday, while she retired at the farewell celebration, Martha Karolyi ministered in retirement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles existed, during their long way to the top, never planned the future, it's not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would take home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl which was adopted by their grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainee Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gym, was trained in Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">She has lost no multi-competition competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak, which is as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustina was slightly led by two rotary switches, the image overlooked.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sweden and Bodies - in which Biles holds the world champion title - lurry.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed again with 15,433 on the Swedish ballet and set a 15.933 on the ground still on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged it gently when they expected their final form - a pure form - and tears-pointer on Biles glossy red, white and blue Eyeliner, as the vision, which it once described in their collection book, to reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The achievement of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a depth of Mustina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old man capaciers, who is called "Oma," had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise, she threw the audience to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes was doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I found under the Women's Olympics in the Turning Observatory, which consists of more than one reason.</seg>

<seg id="7">It has consolidated the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of these sports art.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnast was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">Over the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympics winner and in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be the incredible performance of the three-time world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but most honorable Gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual meeting event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Man member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of these sporting art, but they do not see turnaround in the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck them all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympic Championships will have four gymnasers in the team." "" "the last year with Marta Karolyi is a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that there are a expensive sport and Turner at first line in private gyms, which are maintained by parents for training, training, travel, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families). the list can be continued in any time.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in prosperous suburbs that support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these societies, Turner will receive its total training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes, since then starting with the Turning.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the communities of Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an efficient and easy-to-access gyms.</seg>

<seg id="6">In only eight weeks, the first group of doctors remain under the new contract must be made advances, and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts from the BMA to solve disputes within the government struggled with regard to counters and sometimes diminating silence.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a £2-per day medicine, after the authorities recommended that more people are given for a longer period.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anti-inflammatory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke, or a further heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">The regulatory authority NICE of NHS has recommended four years of intake in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The regulatory authority NICE of NHS has recommended four years of intake in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and punch emergencies are caused by antiviral material in the arterial walls, which form the floorings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the exposure breaks out, it may cause blood flow to hide the blood flow through the heart and thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the blood clots dissolves, it can flow through the blood flow and flow blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who had already had a heart attack, are subject to higher risk to have a further risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is driven under the Brilique trade name, reduces this risk by unlikely the formation of blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="13">The design of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month dosage of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg daily with a twice daily consumption of Aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carols Longson, Director of NICE Healthcare System, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack, a further heart attack, or stroke, often with desastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively improves the reduction of other heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand treatment options on thousands of people who can benefit from that.</seg>
<seg id="18">Information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - mainly the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years. introductory design recommends no treatment that proceeds over this period.</seg>

<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach the front or behind, this video will show you how you turn away for your predators.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you turn back from behind, you should turn the first turning back, so that you can see your attacker and turn from the track line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon then between your forearm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free ellbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat him with the knees in the vest and rotate, while the attackers turn from pains, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move forward, while they make the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">At attackers who are approaching from the front, the technology is similar - move your body from the push line, seize the weapon and rotate it, so that attackers can't shoot them.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British Reiser underwent his immune system and sausages a serious test - providing some of the most dirty and ekelest locations in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk will shut down its course on a euro pone, a banked on the Piccadilly Circus, a purge head of a tractor toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the rectangles of each object, he used a Luminometer to show and show us what he will leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to decompile the purge of a pulling-toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, but actually, in a kitchen, there are more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and their own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left what he woke up, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by passing through the world, and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to railway stations to purge buttons by toilets, the job provided its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned, what my health concerns and I have plugged all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="12">In his film he was just a reputation for his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His denture showed a luminescence of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometry reaches of freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there were a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after her Luminometres of over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have a less than 60 loaves</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the growth of bacteria in different locations like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says, "That's the worst thing I have landed in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'll show nothing here, because there's inside here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria, as well as vitamin C and D in order to support intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching and simultaneously explained the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we led crazy Brainstorbings, who ended, that we said" "" "Let us call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumers more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that the film shows that we have a great sense to humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film, added:" "" "let me say," "" "I have lost my respect for Ian, if he had made some of the things that I have given him to lend as the eky Russian toilet which will be shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things, in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them up and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty leakages. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio conducted in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents were associated with the well-being of gastric and intestines and 58 percent, that they contain at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place at the end of summer holidays at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy Parliament voted already at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because it doesn't work as far as until now it is not: summer holidays, heat, and landing battle.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are convinced by the choices are to be convinced of the vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most tourists who are in the countryside are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are no locals, so may not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: in the holidays are helper, the placards are hanging, air balloons bubbles, flyers and end up the end of the end, only labourism.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the electoral and final day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again have passed over to the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And there is also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, which has been most powerful since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will be exciting, as strongly newcoming AFD remain and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, has an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees almost inconspicuous election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread roses, and plums a little with the people, as it did already his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU with their top candidates, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced, as it is when one makes for wrong time at the right place campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Grand Duke; Merkel's German Bundestag is in the northeast.</seg>

<seg id="23">Otherwise, the northeast-CDU dries largely on the usual electorings on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>

<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering has now invoked his SPD with a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys the S & D Group recently ended with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just under AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election 2011, the SPD was still clearly won with 35.6 percent of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, Small Party, with seven percent in the polls, would probably do the leap into the country day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday of need and place their campaign towards the internet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who buys Soundrecords?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely males like middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before commentuation-parts, in order to oversaw him under the pseudonym-non-balsampler of age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most popular recovery of sound plates do not want to be a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the newness of physical objects, but due to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record, are the foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is no hordes through hobbies - it has an emotional significance: older Plattformers keep their feelings rather to spend (56% vs 53%) and enjoy it alone time to spend on time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow my camera, while I move in a bustling street in Soho, a modest gray suit, my hands hold and something better tell us like: "so, let us take a closer look at a glance."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart rate SoHos goes slowly at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices, now fill up the buildings where once independent salesman are located - there is a handful fantastic business specialised.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in the immediate vicinity of different men in such shops, try to assess their age and mind of observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I recorded by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men aged middle ages) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men aged middle ages, a woman probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, question?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This Schallplatten, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not yet followed at home), dress the walls of its residential room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records, which he could not afford to buy them when he sold young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early '70s, who had appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things in which I thought some too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "he agrees that those who buy records, rather introverted, and like this time to spend time, and adds:" "" "I smoke, and I don't drink much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, which works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets for YouGov-profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the mediator, people who have heard about comeback, and you will see to buy their old plates again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations which I have led, people generally have apologized for about 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their boards to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their boards again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the "" "" "" "" "" "sheet" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like phonica to recognize that record stores a soothing community of equestants.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects, happy Jugenderings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colts of a emptiness or possession of material property than a kind of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's with me as a collector so I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "put a staff of a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April disclosed that almost 50% of the people who have purchased a record last month, they have not heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a turntables that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I was looking through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (number of people: three men of middle ages) has been producing a "trophic aspiration" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone recently returned here and said," "" "I have no turntables, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Sound plate, so I can ask them into the shelf" "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is no big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music lasciously.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who come first slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has an evil public than I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make the photos, teenagers and women aged middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops, wild synthesizers and sextet pop instead of experimental Jazz were used from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but nagating psychological gramata are hard-detectable, if you stand for 30 seconds in length.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and consider the variance of the panels for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more a mannequette bumbs than a big one-one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserves much, therefore it's no real option to collecting disks.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from one computer or to other ways, but the beauty of records is... "they drives them with a sweet seufzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of self-lovers will be inspired by Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the licence to sample the Jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenager to grouped for a moment about Polaroid Cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics that essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to hold them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send in the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most of luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research results, that the results of YouGov can vote, at least in record shops in Soho, the great number of female Collectors in Soho, which exist in reality, business shops and online in online.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety by hanging by hanging shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they cope with the starring views of an infinite, 30-year-old false presenter who runs out over the shoulders of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday night at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji granted a master class in the handling, side-stepping, night-back, liner and raw power to gain gold - their first Olympic waist of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "the defeat was failed by the" "" "Silver medal" "" "- Britain's fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boots, 7-5 in the semifinals of the same day could fall on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have smitten with this form a 15-man-team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be for GB a consolation - but it will probably not - that at least one shite tomorrow will have a gold medal to his neck; Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost among Ryan any game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slap will weave, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks of GBS from Spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. kg, when running in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to top, when Osea Kolinisau walked in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">At another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai played a further attack out of the right corner that he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly oppose the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hacking flickle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa, a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua sparked a touch down in the right corner and it stood at 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the reanpfiff and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preover by another weak tacklings of GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, when Fiji was born to play the 7, while Britain is still studying.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like that too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and completed the fijianic gap... for almost four minutes, what was good for the ratios of the first half-time, until Joshua had crossed the Tuisova after a brilliant stopover of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton, launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran long in favour of the South-catchers, his fans snists, bbs and dance on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliams put the i-door posts with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fibership embellished, the fijis encircled and the GB kickly beaten up in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day Fiji Japan defeated in semi-final with 20-5 and the UK urged South Africa in a crisp-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton on the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliantly late tackling of Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the English 15-seaside teams, secured the gain - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the Trainers</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinaleres of gold than those games, and that wants what will be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing machine to the last, 220 hard hits that go down into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if it was only the Beids who sat at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the Trainers Robin Williams was all present for the second Olympic woman in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, who put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all of her 39.ter undispleased operation, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins that glides on the surface of the elegance of pigs, which does not reflect the type of the Triumphal Arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing there is a battalion suffering from helpers that make the difference and it was no hairy than the trainer, who would not know that day at all, he was diagnosed at all that day when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">How he spoke, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather narrow situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">A little bit changed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had happiness that he could be at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which could start to a minimum, if this is the correct term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore it had to go to me again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet to 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">It begins so.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing itself is a challenge, but it makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inability of victory we went their first thoughts on Williams, who spent a nervending morning to do something more than otherwise, and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, which was a centurion of the Royal artillery Regiment in Afghanistan," "" "I was an emotional wrack. this is perhaps something extremely, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeated, how much I and Helen and Helen also have worked with Robin, too.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would not have a better person for your trainee or better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up close.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even during the last 500 meters, they began to catch the teams from New Zealand and Denmark, stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important to let not break down.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time, we were not making something big.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want a fireworks, we wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take one year for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have been much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London there lasted approximately six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Since young girl, Ursel Kipp has accompanied all her life: as young girl she was in the school choir, she finished the subject of music, and today he sings the 78-year-old in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physical," describes them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, it feels balanced, merrily and a total of life, says it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Incidentally, they do something good with her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is equal to several perspectives: a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Academic League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors are singing in the choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular mergers, seniors can establish social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because frequently dissolve social and family structures in age, one choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "this experience has made Ursel Kipp in their choir:" "" "to arrange themselves and to organize themselves on the others, a choir is a special form of compositions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, suppose hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">He exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who urges his lung regularly, is not so fast as fast as the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it comes to receive the sound of voice in the age, singing is an optimum hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community for Seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common Singen had a much higher job value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz observed often that singing or listeners of songs in elderly people are awakened, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies, human beings abhorred themselves in long-related events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, a special performance in the singing, Lenz will also be required.</seg>
<seg id="20">Simultaneously on the own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even older people who alone are living, practicing themselves, don't just concentrate on himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one goes through the singing in the choir, Hackler writes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show itself: if I'm a long time for something I'll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing with singing, is there enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try out a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he believes, little talent, does Lenz have.</seg>
<seg id="28">Man does not sing alone - at 50 singing people, who listens to it when a tone is coming beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Anyone sings someone from the acquaintability in a nudior, you can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wish to sing in a religious choir, can directly contact the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whoever has no access to the internet can ask family, friends or neighbors to ask help with the Internet calculator.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who's desire to sing, should not be connected to a choir, that hackler hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul good and has something completely liberating - this applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and unbreakable, a permanent relay of Stafford between competition and strians.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympic Fackel itself is a burning staff even, which will protect the swimming pool from the bracelets into triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot listen to TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the Coffeshop, without knowing Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And there's still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a Frauenfeld with dimples, would definitely be sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he would have a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencing.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, struggling for gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow, the sports, which are not generally accepted: air-guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swim and may have it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest arguments for my particular favourite, then the attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the jumping event has been a Olympic event since 2000, when it's debut in Sydney, it was so annoying, so many that I asked, I didn't know that there is a Olympics competition at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA was competing for competition, it never won a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and won an athlete up to 2012, who made it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are able to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese, and the Canadian to divide for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend this year their gold medal from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outer walls, partly because it sounds the unreconnaissance ear for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am no expert, but just a failed enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartography of his never-to-end devils - but also the Grazie of the gym and pig, which combines two sports, which essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means so much like "dive board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Uplifting winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling motions (turning, Hreal and saltos) before joining the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be evaluated according to the official Olympic Institute for execution, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Branches of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go on in their strive after gold, quicker, walking up and down, sometimes until the finish, sometimes go back and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt't just the finish line or the output wall, but in the TV-transmission also another cavity: the world or the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted strive is Nobel, admirable, even fanatically - and it's enough to stir even a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I think about the watch of these games as something more fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumping rope is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">The forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she pruning, seemingly heavier than an astronaut, go down, then down to the top, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here is a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen like the competition during the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amidst the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, which will probably be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness can only be achieved through the angulation and the object of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr Dooley awaits its air-ringing, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, there was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid association with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government had renounced the country, expanding into more areas.</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to meet this country, and in future, Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services closely collaborate closely with Ethiopians, to combat terrorist attacks on the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian Economy expanded in a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there's a new pendulum suit in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continually led through the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents become effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisoned in the prison, put to death in the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>

<seg id="23">The entire youth is protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use to cover the ruling coalition in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a far-review election last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this cacking, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fears that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less forced in recent years, could generate turbulences and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of delay after years of origin now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, very many Ethiopian were able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones were ever more common and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they're in regular intervals, especially with protests, do many people still communicate about Internet proxies, which hide they arise.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians reported that they gathered themselves to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Orocovis, Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since ministries, the Amharas, who come from offices of mainly Christian countries, in politics and economics, while they exploited the Orosei, many Muslims are living in flat-areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are looking to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a guide of the Orosei." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Orosei.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Orosei the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the Ethical group of Tigray, accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military, in trading and politics are dominant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death at a non-public-owned illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was particularly vulnerable to use early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this fundamentalist," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts predict that he would not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fears that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia lived in such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protesting, according to the government of analyser by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following raids were killed, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of turbulences were gone relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praising Ethiopian leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning, as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not have prevented the intensification of internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month's protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, from Tigray, managed business and hatred towards the Tigray becomes ever more common in social media.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrates is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swimming with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks get offspring only with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the ground, the Greenland sharpened ends on the north of the North Atlantic, in an average of 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes down, the five-meter-long animal accelerates at a full 2.6 km / h - and is as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This kind of loneliness lifestyle seems to be a cylinder recipe for a tall age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report their findings in the journal "Science" in any case that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "commenting Alexander Schedlein at the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock," "" "signifies this life span for vertebrates a world record." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist assumed a long time that Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are difficult to watch, they live mainly in the ice sea, especially in the ice-populated crest of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they are water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive at the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have correspondingly little about the lifestyle of the Greenland hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their Time-pentempo measures they set up six animals with one transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly chase them sleeping animals or patrol on the reason of the Ice Age and look for Kadaver, which places higher water layers downstairs down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues therefore studied 28 Greenland-hates, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 as a boulders from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimeters in diameter.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye is created already before the birth of sharks, which the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks still had a lot of carbon-14 in lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s as atomic-affentests greater amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast with 220 centimeters in length, the lenticular nucleus, however, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 out of nuclear weapons, so that in 2012 it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast to the normal carbon-14-quantities, all larger Greenland-sharks had created normal carbon-14 quantities that is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493-centimetre Greenland sharpenance showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark should be 392 years old during the record shark.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females can only get offspring if they are longer than four meters, it was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers have been able to arrange an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland-haze with the multiplication of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This could also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methusal are mainly living in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland, placed on the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon pointed, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">By low temperatures often the organism also runs living animals on sparking.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and slower slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives dangerous and should focus on it, as possible as possible as many descendants as possible," "" "the Evolutionary biologist Schrolein" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to get files, the victims have to have money - usually in the form of Crypsitional Bitcoin - surrender.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database on the game, there are companies for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage drops off if a ransomware goes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported in net loss by Ransomware, 13 percent had to completely break business activities, in case of a fall, people were in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals had already been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by loss of acute acute acutely.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: paying not, you only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to approve the demand for perpetrators in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the Security forscher of F-Secure investigates the use of user interfaces and to the results: the perpetrators are actually trying to form a type of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain your victims by chat as you can pay by Bitcoin, set free-to-access support websites or decrypting free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will redeem individuals after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must pay partly hard-negotiate and five-digit sums to get lost their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potential high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware Erpressors, the hacker will always be professional and share of the antivirus supplier Sophos: "a single person can write an ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">The probability is, however, that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damaging software into the form of a software construction to the actual creation.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by malware, consulting and additional tools for a single-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The press-presses are then looking for further hacker to spread the freshly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, in one of the forums on the Underground, the set of a criminals, and commissioned a further way to install the software on as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per inadequate computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "the criminals apply then spammer to the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, the risk of Ransomware is known now with many companies that secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of companies responsible for the IT-IT data processors have confidence in the Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators pursue new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful recovery, instead, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "ParetoLogic-boss, Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential, depending on the type of data by a more multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Too, the perpetrators could now take completely new goals in the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">During the hackerconference defaults, security researchers demonstrated how to get a controlled thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the connecting of a derart blocked heating so manned sacrifice could be worth a ransom value.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the Daily later blocks a whole production street in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in the industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda will pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1.60 m high HR-V works rather small, passengers have a lot of space in the first line and in the rear, it works in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">Materials of the interior space are well-processed and are pleasant, only the cockpit-top falls off there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not just a boot space of 453 l at high-quality and 1026 l when working with back backs, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magically, as it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be set up like pulleys and provide storage space, which is 1,24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, but the charging height is 650 mm somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp will accelerate the HR V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of speeds.</seg>
<seg id="12">He would like to raise his work somewhat more quiet.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another motor is still available: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering is likely to be somewhat direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the tested top variant "Executive" the equipment can be desired to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The city-emergency assistant belongs to the security systems (works at speeds 32), the precision warning system and the trace assistance.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sometimes, the collision warning shrines sometimes, because it has been assessed by many obstacles as "herannahating objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote care works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent Temporegulator reacts to traffic sign recognition and drosselt when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket are below the armrest and are therefore somewhat controversial.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top-diesel are all right.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who doesn't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 euros, the diesel starting from 23000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro-6 emission standard.</seg>

<seg id="8">Just that can sleep well as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German household association with practice in Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>

<seg id="12">Not rare is the insulsion expression of an other disease.</seg>

<seg id="14">And it can be that several factors aballs each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example has a herniated disc, can be poorly lie, awakes every two to three hours and starts womens to salvels about everyday problems and provide an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>

<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is beaten, tired, uninterrupted, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to prevent sleep disturbing, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic wooden tablets only in case of emergency and maximum for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there are hardly any insulent sleeping in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the physician, sown Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problems may clarify, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should happen to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in sleep laboratory, medical profession allows for example with caresses with respiratory sickness, in case of sickness or if you don't disturb the cause of a sleep disturb.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>

<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Innensenator had several times for a hard prevention of police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, unlocked parts of the road and held visitors to the house with the number 94.</seg>

<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road looks peaceful: parents are walking with children, men sit on the sidewalks in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain a prem späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there are elementary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives since 1999 in the Kiez, and Jana *, who separated three children, mostly from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the hood, they share their concern in rising tenants and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sounds like a Kiez, who wanted to get a majority of political protection against the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Innensension and the police are upset between squatters and their neighbours, obviously doesn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin actually was a traditional working quarter, which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average and high arsenic risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many houses and bornatives have already been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in former DDR (GDR), including almost the entire mainboard street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainstream had been cleared under large police authorities, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are inhabited by people still occupied by people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly become magnets for tourists and selector liners from all over the world: with them, residents of GDR times and former hometers share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This has also been noticeably noticeable, which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings will be attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them with stranded slices or freshly coated façades that were thrown with color explores.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned so often together with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "a reason that all neighbors could not be seen as problem, that they don't imply imply affected by crime: criminal offences like body injuries is almost exclusively against policemen." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the criminal charges make non-damage, the tendencies rather the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, cannot be any speech.</seg>
<seg id="27">What acts of violence is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who don't have been known.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will give it directly to the Rigaer longer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the administration team of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, workers, refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else!</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are grateful more than thankful that Deuschle is now that there is a busy Wolllactic, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mockingly experienced a lot on the wide variety of business areas - meant that the administration wanted to write the site.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sought a board of management with a talent for languages and people, connected with a longstanding experience in the area of social work, just a busy Wollsmchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative labor is not its central area, means Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, around organization, work with people on site and even behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been doing so for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle Honor and main stakeholders are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and comprehension problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers in the Wasenstraße stand soon</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to be found since some time, apartments for connecting flights have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection output.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must teach refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility change from the council, the commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Until now, it is not working on private apartments, so Deut.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, private apartments must be infamous, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, new containers will soon be positioned in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle are logged in.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm lead, training places, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and foreign aid to refugees and migrants who have to be arranged or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports regine.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many works in the building yard or help Household, charitable work - and the motivate and very neat, like Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the building leads to a positive external impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">Worked, however, does not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day require a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a seniority.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offerings such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">This also jump here administration and honorary volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally that the refugees get the feeling to be desired and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it takes to pass it and bridged the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever knows the feeling, he could not work in Urbach doesn't work, and be unprofitable, who will never go.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, however, says customer honest, "people, in which even nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and client is therefore always to motivate others too.</seg>
<seg id="47">All that is already a "mammary task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two be afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine is quite clear," "" "what lack of naiv will call." "" "a residual risk, however, would not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized, the helper is already.</seg>
<seg id="51">This incidents are subject to the refugees too.</seg>
<seg id="52">They wished the fear that the terrorist attacks in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do," "" says Regine customer. "" "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary volunteers must be placed on site and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have a new impact on refugees and migrants coming to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to introduce them to the place.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there, where we would like," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already fully exploited to integrate the previous human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need of poverty, both women are able to help them.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
