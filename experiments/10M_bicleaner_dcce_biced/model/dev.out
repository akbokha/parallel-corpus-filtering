Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not so friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an on dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , it should also go about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious since years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing municipal settlement of Israel , causing the cause of un@@ belief in the peace process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the deal of Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of US Congress , which was assessed as a monkey against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in a emergency call he is appointed professor to have shot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb , with a somewhat angry voice of the police , that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and said the officials have to come to his house .
Lamb is important to emphasi@@ ze that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said that could be the family relations of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house , the officials found the dead bodies of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note that I loved it , I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no reference to the Lamb who spent in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , completed already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he killed and killed a popular natural professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University , Poli@@ nam@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Universal Employ@@ ees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 AM .
he said , Lamb has made the self @-@ suspended emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day , there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police fired him .
one day after shooting in the university , students and l@@ ect@@ ur@@ ers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still trying to get a picture of it , a jum@@ per .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the State , such as those of the students and staff who knew him , helped them to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they list@@ ened to his instruction .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he &apos;s not a history of violence or criminal record history .
in one of his written book , Schmidt himself had mentioned him , in which he mentioned the wonderful people , &quot; he gave his academic life .
both trained in the department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ yers , the Lamb pra@@ ises , said , he appeared as a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to provide a ur@@ l@@ ur@@ king for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university important that the doctorate , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic way to an application as assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; univers@@ ality @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions , which can no longer answer the Lamb .
after the escape from the campus , the police then later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s lane , where he moved to the Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he could be arrested , a self @-@ imposed a .@@ 38 c@@ ali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents at the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran into the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew men who knew people living there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb took up his work at the university , which 3.500 students in a town of 12,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctorate in spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long@@ standing gir@@ ders of Lam@@ bs described it as a smart , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
she said to Car@@ la Hair@@ ston , she was 15 and he was 20 , when they met together .
they and their friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to play the guitar game .
back then , he was the Women &apos;s Black .
all girls w@@ mel@@ ted away , when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and P@@ enti@@ ss were quite some time .
in the emergency call Lamb ... &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that adjacent to a ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sh@@ awn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were left by 15 years ago , but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter .
her and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never had encounter@@ ed , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he has heard that he was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up both on a summer @-@ standing market three years ago .
later they played together one another or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter is writing and s@@ ings her own music .
pom@@ eg@@ ss was a nur@@ se , which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sh@@ aff@@ er , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak back@@ lit bar at the night of G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had been a Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of 5 September after the guitar and harmon@@ ic asp@@ ire finished before a late audience .
there were no signs that anything was in@@ consistent .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the dreams and scher@@ ling .
I mean , they both had a good sense for jo@@ king .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first @-@ semester program and specialized in American native people and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school .
he was married with three little children .

UN Leader says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon said , his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria , &quot; There is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only fail for millions of people only .
the UN Leader demands again all parties , including the divided United Nations Security Council to un@@ ite and to support integ@@ rative negotiations to finance a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member states of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the periph@@ ery of the General Assembly &apos;s session in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he re@@ gre@@ ts that the counsel in the Council and the Syrian people and Regional Churches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ uble &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

8 Circ@@ ulation values , showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is seriously taken .
some have temp@@ ted him to be bran@@ ded him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but doesn &apos;t matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from upper push @-@ down in down@@ p@@ olls to down@@ s , it doesn &apos;t work yet .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is too early in the elect@@ oral period .
none claim@@ ing that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts who were present at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys took the leadership of the rising Herman Cain , of which no one won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gling in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing thr@@ ott@@ est assets and begin to flow their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some recent renovation values , which suggest that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
m@@ umps are most appreciated and have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy center in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the property in Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten saying that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers stand in early countries .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa was last week confirmed that 60 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thir@@ ds of GO@@ P v@@ oters were happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ ying &quot; if the candidate would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about sli@@ pping ) .
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can v@@ oters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; in@@ off@@ ended &quot; if each Bush , the favorite of establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see tri@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely discussed for his bom@@ b@@ la@@ tic and ins@@ ult@@ ing statements , 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans of Irish v@@ oters think that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul says the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first state @-@ state of the nation , I@@ owa State , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he saw the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent think that he didn &apos;t have the personality to effectively hold his position and almost six out of 10 Independent States say that its temper@@ ament is not into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can v@@ oters turn to the idea .
when they exp@@ ose their nest @-@ up , republi@@ can v@@ oters be real for real terms .
if you ask , who will be asked if the GO@@ P nom@@ ination win the GO@@ P / OR@@ C pol@@ l out of ten , four of ten , that Tr@@ ump be the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten of July went money to Je@@ b Bush .
&quot; &quot; &quot; full announcement : GO@@ P @-@ v@@ oters had not the clear crystal ball in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidates fellow Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P v@@ oters Tr@@ umps is looking for a pl@@ au@@ sible event .
even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump offers almost everyone .
some experts indicate that the cer@@ v@@ ical field probably contributes to the umps lead , while anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other candidates diff@@ us .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical mind @-@ at @-@ head race between b@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , dr@@ unk@@ ards are harv@@ ested .
he was ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points ahead of Walker 15 points , before Den@@ b Bush 19 points and finally against Rand Paul , John Ka@@ es and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate , who performs it ?
Ben Car@@ son would take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical mind @-@ to @-@ head race .
a big majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump fans say that they have formed their opinion .
a recent survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only some more than half of v@@ oters , which support tr@@ ump , say that they have confirmed their voices .
of course , can happen to change that , and no one can really say that never change his opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
however , Tr@@ umps is the most powerful competition at the moment of the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but v@@ oters , who have formed their opinion , are twice as often for tr@@ ump .
six of the 10 Republi@@ can say they are to be agreed with tr@@ ump on immigration .
ever &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign initiated two months ago , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Im@@ migration Rot@@ ary and Angel@@ s became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public dis@@ course in public dis@@ course in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are wor@@ ried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic toler@@ ability of Tr@@ ump is deci@@ ding deci@@ ph@@ ative that from the Republi@@ can Party and dam@@ aging the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey last Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans reported that you agree to opp@@ ose the issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration in the spotlight ab@@ ides , it will do Donald Tr@@ ump apparently .
the fru@@ str@@ ation about the government has climbed to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of republi@@ can v@@ oters fall mainly through their external se@@ ash@@ ites .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans will in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they would rather like to see a political out@@ si@@ iter than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by The Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans were fru@@ str@@ ated in the Congress of the Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ bies , the most expensive complex is located - with view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a room building costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which particular layers will cost a square meter of most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for one of the students in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top neighbor@@ hoods , the price does , however , occur as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel and Völ@@ ders published a ranking of exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ ering prices in di@@ zz@@ ying height .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro no - per square meter , comfortable .
but good to those who can aff@@ ord ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception here .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream starts thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
double Tor@@ s@@ man in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a barrel .
a happy ending showing by Thomas Müller on the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then ran it .
a so@@ vereign re@@ launch of the Champions @-@ League season .
in the Wit@@ ch , the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Go@@ tz@@ e have donated a dream start to the Milan &quot; mission in Milan .
the crew of Trainer P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ e hits ( 8 . ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth stage in series is to be the first step toward the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get to the H@@ enk@@ el@@ z@@ t in Munich .
Müller got married at the Champions League on the Bavarian Leadership in the Champions League for the h@@ ops of Olympics , Roberto , who left one as flan@@ k to pass the world champion .
&quot; we will not appreciate it , &quot; he &apos;d promised Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 farmers - and the Munich conflict held a word .
she showed a concentrated and committed idea without sh@@ am@@ ing .
Pi@@ raeus held his youngest six home games in the p@@ inn@@ acle , including against renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next sacrifice .
they went , however , at their reve@@ aling efforts , but often to be resour@@ ce@@ ful .
the attacks were frequently passed on line shift to Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , who rarely encounter@@ ed the former Braunschwei@@ ger Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i , rarely passed .
Müller had left no more happiness than its flange from the right half @-@ field in the left upper end of To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , when the olymp@@ ic stor@@ ms Brown Brown suggested the Pole of the Pole of the line ( 26 ) .
then , by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper was par@@ ked with the kne@@ es ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bayern dominated its usual game , Pi@@ raeus staged pin@@ point pre@@ ach@@ ery .
on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neuer has been .
thus , as he de@@ pressed a shot of ide@@ ye on the lan@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before New Jer@@ ome Gu@@ ardi@@ ola brought a square with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Go@@ tz@@ e , after musc@@ ular problems back in the c@@ ader , sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the closing training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPOR@@ VA Matthias Sam@@ mer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that is v@@ icious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola ruled against him , when he brought to K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the strug@@ gling ch@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller was still a dr@@ one .
before the game , T@@ ie was running on tie @-@ tie in the stadium .
after a smaller group of h@@ anno@@ yed Bayern @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block apparently the followers of hosts pir@@ ae@@ us believed in words and gest@@ ures , the security forces seized and went out with p@@ unch over the Munich fans .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan has been injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has higher possibility of losing teeth
so who is smoking , does not only handle the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - that places a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : if zi@@ cht , the risk drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
it emerged from the long @-@ term study of an international team of researchers , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers only increases the risk of losing their teeth as early as to lose the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,6 @-@ F@@ ache .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth out@@ age are Kar@@ ies and inflammation of the g@@ um , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasi@@ zing the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore lower for frequent t@@ ing@@ itis in smo@@ kers .
not to be clari@@ fied , to what smoking is also increased the risk of car@@ ies .
people who heard with smoking could reduce their risk , however , within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could take over ten years , however , until the endanger@@ ing was restored to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , Mr. Thomas Dietrich von der English University Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; man don &apos;t persu@@ ade people to meet non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not too smoking is good for l@@ ungs and vessels and leads according to our insights , too to a good dental health to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 @-@ 74 years have been affected by t@@ ooth@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E part@@ ed .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early dental fail@@ ures .
the new long @-@ term study induc@@ es the findings .

in all buildings in the district of Cologne , the museum will always be considered as a department for arch@@ eological soil cultivation .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards the arch@@ ae@@ ologists have become part of the arch@@ ae@@ ologists .
it was already known from text documents , that at the place in the 4th century , a fortress was standing there and in the 8th century also explained a church .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church there was also a cemetery with approximately 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes in dispute over TTIP new court
in TTIP to resol@@ ute the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private lighting equipment for disputes between businesses and states are expected to be replaced by a transparent system that corresponds with clearly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to use a system to be trusted by citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner for Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the performance of performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ din tried to install the U.S. negoti@@ ating position in the free trade negotiations with the US .
the German government announced its support .
with TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is expected to rise to 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings will notice that EU states and the U.S. will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to the same parts from the EU , the US and third @-@ party countries .
this is the second instance for the first time .
it would allow it to raise up against author@@ it@@ ments .
so far , the responsibility of the proceedings involved themselves to arbit@@ rators , a claim against the judgments were not .
in the discussion of recent months , we had become clear that citizens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in matter of fair@@ ness and justice , commenting on Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , she wants to work according to his own international investment court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and the EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) required mainly of large conc@@ ert@@ ante @-@ arbit@@ ration proceedings as one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TTIP .

delicate folk music from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
next to him , a flip chart is found on which the cur@@ ly acting Fol@@ os@@ ch is recorded by the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is in the case of Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he rel@@ ates at various places that he always records on the map , what about his min@@ u@@ ously and sub@@ species @-@ arranged songs .
where they were created , and how it looks like , in his home country .
since then Stev@@ ens proves itself as a wonder@@ fully creative ma@@ ze .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; we composed a clever songs that cap@@ tiv@@ ate harmonious very close to American folk , late six@@ ties , but always great opul@@ ent drift .
the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a hidden series : each of the 50 US states should be discussed in a row .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine has already been &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans , &quot; and there was positively certain expectations .
reduces Stev@@ ens here on .
live will meet him and Ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician will return to the series in New @-@ York .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is a nationwide celebrated master@@ piece in 2005 .
bor@@ ing of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any year with the most influential music media .
in the case of very productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sales .
this sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but compiled by programmable sequences or be@@ ats and plays with very all effect and Hall .
for smaller clubs , the stage shows are seen here for the colourful spectac@@ le in Ne@@ on @-@ front@@ n@@ b@@ last and intense fluorescent stage .

without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad @-@ enriched Album .
the audience list@@ ens to the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and thus one can throw the &quot; plate in fact . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ bit@@ ns debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ ru@@ ns has expected excitement in the prime minister of the Prime Minister with tension .
new Labour Party Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn allegedly set up his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s freight findings and publi@@ ci@@ zed David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn will take on@@ ward to provide the first of its six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and to the Labour MPs out of its proximity .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; with this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p several meetings to ski@@ p them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ ru@@ ns , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow bal@@ let , and after his speech at TU@@ C @-@ Annual on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain &apos;s decision on Tuesday , the decision of the Battle of Britain prov@@ okes in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S compl@@ ements and stands in the centre of several title pages @-@ stories about newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision to sing the national an@@ them , has gained attention ...
a spokesperson on Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn , he would have been standing in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and he has acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ ru@@ ns Sh@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Party to sing the &apos; Labour &apos; , &quot; independent of his faith that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shade @-@ ministers have refused to serve as a leader in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , Mr Cor@@ ru@@ ns , and she was called on dis@@ agreements on the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party had originally supported him as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are in lab@@ elled &quot; Labour &quot; and Mr Cor@@ ru@@ ns &apos;s statements on position towards the European Union and the limitation to win@@ nings .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are set to remove the entire idea of a limitation total .
hours later , Mr Smith said the shadow @-@ working and pensions ministers said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that they may only be against the government plans , lim@@ iting 26@@ ,000 £ to $ 23@@ .000 .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , ever since he &apos;s T@@ ory Chef , over the Dis@@ patch Box in the European Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour MEP , who promised a policy of policy , says that he has released &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ row@@ d @-@ sourc@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ al , and that he is subject to both &quot; Schlag@@ alt@@ fulness &quot; and the carrying case with contra@@ diction , and that , in serious problems , focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn told that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic advis@@ er , will not be participating - for example if Mr. Cameron is on the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea to talk that other colleagues can occasionally take the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was frequently conc@@ aten@@ ated by policy in the style of a &quot; Bu@@ ster le @-@ Theatre , &quot; which often became widely visible with the prime minister of the Prime Minister . however , he de@@ vised a few years later that he failed .
since it was first sent to television in 1990 , the qu@@ ests were regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the decision and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his Parliament , although Cri@@ tics had argu@@ ed , they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require further reforms .

Po@@ unds raised by accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has climbed up @-@ to @-@ date data that was a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the N@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared with the same period last year .
this percentage had been the fastest and wor@@ e ass@@ ess@@ ments on the time of interest in interest since 2009 .
the pound has risen by more than 1 % compared to the dollar at $ 1,@@ 5@@ 505 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the ri@@ val AB In@@ P@@ v was entered .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and combine marks like Bud@@ ì@@ j@@ ovice , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
according to the competition Bur@@ berry stock , Bur@@ berry stock was 0.9 % higher by the competition for luxurious assets .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - will increase growth again .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore climbed 5 % after the mining sector told us that he had acquired $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of its strategy of debt .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the biggest tra@@ der on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sachs had assumed his assessment for the company rating &quot; rating . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the di@@ ligence company reported a pre @-@ tax result of € 4@@ 6.6 million for the first half .
the b@@ oss of J@@ D Sports says that Higher W@@ ages end@@ anger the expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sport Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; means greater buying power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is un@@ likely that this purchasing power will exp@@ ose the higher labour costs in its company , he says .
the cost might make the exp@@ o plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there is less additional jobs .

potatoes or d@@ eter ?
it goes both - and although in the potato twe@@ eter , the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ach owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed .
inspired by the fr@@ ying &quot; potato instead of d@@ eter &quot; on a poster by the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat has attached to a sk@@ e@@ wer .
in the idea , a poster brought him a poster with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had quite accid@@ entally watched on television .
since then , it drives in his store a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; Al@@ h@@ ay writes .
the idea has now been working in the office of the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
how much flesh and how much potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ ders contain , Al@@ h@@ ay will therefore not be betra@@ yed .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds .
even during its clients , the culinary understanding will be favourable .
Met@@ ric begins ground authority campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea
a cash @-@ cash is tried to protect IG@@ A stores in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesaler distributor established a ground authority launched to defend the market share of IG@@ A private dealers in South Australia and Western Australia in the ap@@ ron of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two regional centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , met@@ ty and IG@@ A supermarkets are expanding their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events as Adelaide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer Sim@@ mo from Dun@@ s@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A stores , selling stores and selling stores for the South Australian football League to loy@@ al customers .
a cash of further details of its defence strategy will be published on September 29 when the wholesaler made for food , alcohol and equi@@ p@@ ments to the annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A car@@ bu@@ iness , which generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in Eastern countries .
procurement managers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious market share as in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia and nearly 14 percent in Western Australia .
however , analysts believe that Al@@ di Morgan Stanley purchased at the opening of its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states , however , analysts at Morgan Stanley purchased nine months after opening his first markets .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath at Morgan Stanley estimates that IG@@ A will lose 360 $ million sales per year and a cash of $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this predic@@ tion is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in any market .
loss in the food and grocery store and amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost approximately 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in Eastern countries , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan discovered that IG@@ A buyers were the most loy@@ al .
Morgan Stanley believes that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , was one of the decade of business in Melbourne that is likely to disappear outside a decade .
Met@@ ric refused to react to comments from Mr Dou@@ glass to comment on Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income derived from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the operative debt reduction in constant pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
wholes@@ al@@ ers , however , are investing more than 150 million $ to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ at@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and improve their shops through rapid @-@ growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label food products .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business guide Ian Mor@@ rice says that pricing and charging programs to El@@ an are sure and hopes that the Taiwan wholesaler in 2017 will return to a profit @-@ growth in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is ear@@ ns more praise as a criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and ear@@ ns to view the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly more praise as a criticism for his own behaviour .
co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special KS , &quot; by the not@@ orious scientist of Cy@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati as soon , co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponents Ryan Har@@ rison were to be separated with the arbit@@ rator , Har@@ rison had to beat : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka , and I should beat this child . &quot;
while he was seen on a tennis bat , as he destroyed a tennis bat , after having defended a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Co@@ ch@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the runner @-@ up of Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup round @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; one thing , through which I rather er@@ ei@@ f@@ ere , is the fact that after my view , Tan@@ asi , a little bit put up in the dispute , said He@@ aly .
he has broken up a ra@@ cket as he lost because of a var@@ ic@@ ile in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken for himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud .
but , indeed , he went extremely well in the US Open extremely well , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think it deser@@ ves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe that he was a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old he works very hard , and he doesn &apos;t have a problem with the other players , he is trained well in form , he is well in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ve it to be judged according to his own services .
He@@ aly supported the decision that Cy@@ gios works to the important decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , as an long @-@ term integral part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the Team is completely focused on the competition , and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y around the contro@@ vers@@ y &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has done quickly the promotion , in people like Feder@@ er and Murray , and he deser@@ ve all the criticism that he can &apos;t think him . some time outside the r@@ amp , in which he can think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emer@@ gen@@ cies , conclu@@ des the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ eg@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the tried to get illegal in the country . everything with the aim to stop mig@@ rant migrants .
chaos following the border , as hundreds of migrants who fought in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials re@@ acted to in@@ dig@@ nation .
people who fled to violence have fled for an unknown time in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built there themselves .
but fru@@ str@@ ations went up .
as a police helicopter dealing with them , the immigrants &quot; open the borders ! &quot; and they cried out against the Hungarian commitment .
some dismissed from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants coming from Hungary had failed to arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the coming days meetings with Brussels and other countries , Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border , a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree to immigration policy .
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who took refuge in the survived Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope , eventually - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the entry crisis of the continent .
in Hungary , however , Hungary continued its hopes for a strong action from Brussels , or its neigh@@ bors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emer@@ gence of emer@@ gen@@ cies in two southern regions gave authorities more power to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down streets and asylum asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also plan to stop the construction of a bar@@ n wire through its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , after having killed a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even the pris@@ ons of the competition initiated a bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the last months , Hungary became a number of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere the Middle East has become a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck and the entrance point into the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has however in@@ sist@@ ed that most of the upcoming economic models are looking for a better life , and not war refugees , entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which entered into force around midnight , crosses the crossing of the border , or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high Z@@ a@@ uns , to bring the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher adhesive strips for the human traffic@@ king .
&quot; because of the situation , which emerged through the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emer@@ gen@@ cies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of military personnel , which is expected for the next week , but Rep@@ orter of Associated Press had already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already on day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , the country &apos;s security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban said that the authorities have 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are therefore accused of police and are accused of off@@ end criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are involved to repair the fence .
during the Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia included , after a tow@@ ing wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos led the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to tackle the data from people and pressed a crowd to penet@@ rate there .
around 20 succeeded to escape , but thousands of them remained outside .
another group of migrants were blo@@ cked the most important highway connected by Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse to travel food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s advantage ahead of Bern@@ ie S@@ anders in national survey
the former U.S. Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton keeps still a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around the national level , but Senator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders gain towards the ground .
Clinton has now backed up of 47 percent of democratic v@@ oters in the previous elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is on second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who is not yet announced , he receives support for the presidential council , receives support of 15 percent of democratic v@@ oters in the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic v@@ oters say that it is too early to say that their opinion will support them .
however , Clinton &apos;s supporters participate in their election as one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost some prizes in a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had achieved some gains .
Clinton keeps a big increase in women and cath@@ olic , but these jumps are reduced .
your support in the men is pl@@ ung@@ ed , and S@@ anders is only going back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage of democratic v@@ oters under 50 years has volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton has , however , despite a big advance in the older v@@ oters .
in the last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with double @-@ digit advance at the liberal , but S@@ anders has now reached a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic v@@ oters will say nationwide that they would continue to assist with enthusiasm , if it were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some preliminary events and 15 percent would only support them because she is the can@@ did@@ actic .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ &apos;s &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are stronger with those who do not support Clinton in - just about one neighborhood would not be thr@@ illed .
while 48 percent of democratic v@@ oters will say that they will not support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can v@@ oters want more than their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ &apos;s supporters who would ask in an open question , why they want that she has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is a woman ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
&quot; Clinton &apos;s supporters will continue their union with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval for dealing with problems and v@@ oters will also be cited as well .
as the vice president th@@ rows the potenti@@ als for the Russian Federation , 57 % of democratic v@@ oters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic v@@ oters will be requested , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den would be the lead .
from Clin@@ &apos;s followers more than half that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far from S@@ anders .
the bi@@ ds decides , not for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s advantage increases just 30 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without losing him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic v@@ oters will see Clinton as a Canadian player with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure dropped by 78 per cent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measuring , but the percentage which looks for him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , during the question , what is more important at a Candi@@ date , DRC v@@ oters call questions on v@@ oters .
similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these v@@ oters will be un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of v@@ oters in the elect@@ or@@ ists of their party .
fut@@ ures consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den tours the best candidate at the top three candidates , whereas Clin@@ &apos;s Power &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty @-@ percent of democratic v@@ oters think that Clinton is hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say more than S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion from him .
Democratic v@@ oters of the pres@@ election often see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic v@@ oters no opinion from S@@ anders .
since questions on Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and an server during the term as an external Minister , the most Democratic v@@ oters will be pleased with their explanation of the aff@@ air and saying that their opinions had not influenced altogether .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public .
now half of Americans is dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only a third is satisfied .
public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came into light , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion ti@@ fies her opinion .
there are mainly republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse by Clinton .
although it is perceived and trusted by the v@@ oters of their party as the tru@@ thful and trusted v@@ oters . only 32 per cent see it in hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the v@@ oters are not holding their hon@@ our@@ able and tru@@ st@@ worthy persons .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the v@@ oters will see Tr@@ ump as a non @-@ hon@@ est and trusted not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump however , get good notes on leadership .
on the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush will best take care of hon@@ esty .
a majority looks rather hon@@ est , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion from him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic v@@ oters in the previous elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son rever@@ t to Donald Tr@@ ump at a national survey
Ben Car@@ son is situated at the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times for Donald Tr@@ ump
in the two candidates , half of the support of v@@ oters will now fall in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can v@@ oters will continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers . 23 % in recent C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate in the last month , to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son boo@@ oss in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son exceeds responsibility at demo@@ graphic groups and b@@ ump in republi@@ can v@@ oters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ es , is defeated with Wiscon@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who is at the lowest level , by 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida &apos;s Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % on the third place .
error mar@@ ge at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can v@@ oters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s up to the surveys - it ends with 19 % support in the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind po@@ king &apos;s 32 % support .
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post revealed pl@@ ump mark@@ edly ahead of Car@@ son .
at a glance at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ ie@@ ves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son turned to ask tri@@ umps of faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign website in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant pool temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
also , if peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already one Trip to Mediterranean Sea to find even warm water .
a bad in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
it is no longer going into the sea : the maximum of 18 degrees has the water at the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .

five of the Brotherhood is charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ et &apos;s death
almost two years after a student during a sh@@ ik@@ an@@ ous rit@@ u@@ als in a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania and died , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ owski were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood out@@ captured Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory rit@@ u@@ als in September 2013 and delayed it &apos;s transportation to the hospital , he shared the police .
civil servants said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , while he tried to attack for repe@@ ating a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he un@@ consci@@ ously fell .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood Don &apos;t help the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned , expecting an hour before they brought him into a hospital like the police .
however , they had time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to sign its symptoms of goo@@ dies and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national pre@@ sidents of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ tit@@ ef Chris Wagner to a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide and set the Brotherhood from the Brotherhood in principle about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sign@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died on his injuries on the next morning .
following a Autop@@ si@@ e@@ report , Den@@ g were repeated with a bl@@ ot@@ ted force of injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Muslim Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 , Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , says in an explanation .
bro@@ therh@@ oods and their members need to be bred , and this step by authorities is very important .
a Monroe Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder of the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with h@@ ik@@ an@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only do the participating people , but if it has an organization that has - officially or un@@ official - this will also be sanc@@ tioned by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner to a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood finally resist@@ s its affili@@ ation to the local village .
this will happen if F@@ ed increases interest rates
a pro @-@ tax threat is coming , and the Haus@@ ary will be sh@@ aken for bonds , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long this will last and how long will it happen .
especially the history of the economy provides a small step to the exp@@ iration .
a recession appeared within 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
ag@@ gression of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank have so heavily emphasi@@ zed that investors should not concentrate on increasing , when it begins to increase interest rates , rather during the time frame that is required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants may indicate that the whole excitement could possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is being interpreted by a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication by customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest at normal high al@@ titudes , but still at low level to observe the seism@@ ic shock , which do many appear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a historical trends based on it , how some areas of business could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the placing of interest advertis@@ ed things could volati@@ le things to a while .
once the increase tou@@ ches , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there &apos;s apparently a ten@@ dency to compens@@ ate for wealth contracts 12 to 24 months after the first increase , reflecting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank Anal@@ ysts in a recent study suggest@@ ing what after interest under@@ went the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is in the last 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to the interest rate , fairly flat in the 250 days after having an average return in recent six past cycles of 14.4 percent , according to a current analysis , the CEO of Bob D@@ oll , chief system @-@ stron@@ gh@@ s at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks later occur in the Incre@@ asing cycle , and the return on equity begins to reduce .
rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but under@@ growth she often promote interest .
in the current case , F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that could not accelerate and could accelerate the recession .
it is remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate of inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , since 1950 , German bank reported only two nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3,6 per cent , only few that this will continue and expect just 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
inser@@ ting at a frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; if this time is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have launched the whole year on a t@@ opping rating of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trade causes only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all enh@@ ancing cycles of 1950 to date in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um took place in the GDP and on non @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists very quickly after the start of recovery into the sh@@ adows , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
contrary to this , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest who has wa@@ ited for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market suggests a t@@ opping rating , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds faster is faster than shares , when changing its strategic course .
using bonds , the mar@@ gins seem to change the direction once the first increase / reduction takes place in the cycle .
at the end of the Incre@@ asing cycle the firms will fall instantly , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer relations between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ation of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate even though . &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect greater profits , &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st near Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting is what the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adapted to stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has grown , the income curve is flat , cre@@ ek has expanded and the volati@@ lity has grown - all characteristics of the market if F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in large and whole , businesses that accum@@ ulate the larger part of their business in the US , benef@@ iting interest rates and become more attractive to local products .
multin@@ ational enterprises with high debt are worse , as an increase of dollars will be more expensive on the global market and likewise funding your debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares are circum@@ cised three months after an initial inser@@ tion of interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ Anal@@ ysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a report to the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet attributable to weak balance after each of the rate of interest in 1994 , in 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ratios as well as low volati@@ lity with their shares met also their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts are becoming a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose the most , &quot; Gold@@ man said .
outside the pres@@ sur@@ ized applications , consumers are also able to benefit from the increasing dollars .
savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts are in different opinion , as soon as that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member , Andrew B@@ ingham ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; the member of Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the broad@@ caster because of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to differenti@@ ate between commercial ri@@ vals .
he also directed to the BBC Music Awards and said they just im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins , the sending The Voice to Pharaoh , said that this has not been very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , maintains a leading member of the board and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do anything the private sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Kon@@ a MP Andrew B@@ ingham was also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly won &apos;t be distinguished from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I am using the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was also directed to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , The Br@@ its seem to be among other names .
so , if you try to do something else , these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples , at which you &apos;re actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Manager and argu@@ ed the acc@@ us@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 looks far ahead of his commercial competitors if it comes to live music and clari@@ fication of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music making music really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works on behalf , I also really matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , argu@@ ing that har@@ der will work hard to engage in the audience , when the British had been informed about classical music .
radio 3 was , however , not the only element of the BBC manufacturing , which during the consultation in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport contributed under fire to get the commercial ri@@ val onto the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Collins , The Voice to the BBC , the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producers Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
LORD Hall was in@@ sist@@ ed that BBC 1 show was produced by Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Justice - &quot; on special BBC style . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our house @-@ house &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when it star@@ ed for the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to termin@@ ate the order of additional rows of The Voice in the future or to give money of the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet revenue rose in August on the slow@@ est side and Black Friday cannot be responsible for it .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online selling .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the start of record in 2000 .
online sales strengthened 3 years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday was bra@@ ked in November .
for over a decade , the virtual shopping ro@@ om@@ bs , and many of Britain &apos;s major high@@ ways have changed themselves in spirit @-@ towns .
yet experts say that there are now indications that the online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of record in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the years , and in 2000 it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG @-@ sale publisher in the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that the online sales increased three years ago , as a purch@@ aser started to make purchases made with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , such as home on the sofa .
but now the one comm@@ utes himself , and we may experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the following deal@@ ings .
experts believe that buyers will stop their purchases in this event , each of which will take place last Friday in November .
last year the average number of buyers were about their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites over@@ threw themselves .
experts believe that Black Friday believes the buyer could fight for bar@@ gains , buyers of which could ab@@ duct purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium took place that £ 5 expenditure was posted slightly over £ 1 online .
more than one third of purchases now are carried out via Web @-@ shops with some products such as TV and washing machines .
at the same time more than a quarter of man bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of fashion labels in the interior .
Muslims re@@ struc@@ ts in M@@ ec@@ ca on the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are Muslims with the first par@@ ishes throughout M@@ ec@@ ca and the streets
Saudi Arabia presents the collapse of the enormous Saudi Bin Laden Group to the load
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were victims , were killed , to bury them that were killed , as a crane collap@@ sed on Mek@@ ka Groß@@ Mo@@ sch@@ ee .
trau@@ ma filled , largely in white , the route to declare their respect , as the first of the dead lived their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ erie cemetery .
the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession started in the Holy Sites , where only days earlier a building crane due to the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed bo@@ red .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for fun@@ eral , the Saudi King over the building company of the Bin Laden by the cat@@ astrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , had hang@@ ed a sanc@@ tion .
the bodies of 29 workers were killed , as a crane collap@@ sed as a crane due to the Big Central Committee M@@ ec@@ ca , were borne by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgri@@ mage was over@@ thrown during the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the yearly H@@ add@@ in in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi @-@ officials already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch of M@@ ec@@ ca with thousands of those who continue to get to the city will continue .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden , could not have the arm of the crane , as he was not used .
an Arabic version of L@@ gs , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , stated that the Bin Laden Group is in charge of the collapse .
the news agency in English speaking the news agency did not report this detail , however , that the company &apos;s leadership should be prohibited .
early this week , Sal@@ man praised himself to unv@@ eil the fall of the crane that fell into a courtyard of the Groß@@ Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the H@@ add@@ sch , which later revealed in this month .
the Bin Laden Group published no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
Royal Decree had also included the group because of its current security measures , because they did not co@@ operate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes led to Mek@@ ka Groß@@ Mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , which is led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the ruler family of Saudi Arabia since decades and will take over bigger building projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was dispos@@ s@@ essed of the family in 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane resulted in a strong winds and rain , a few days prior to arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgri@@ mage that is required at least once a week of every healthy Muslims .
civil servants said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials admitted that 1 million gi@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the killed were the same in the last .
other injured will receive half this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap European craftsmen can be found
Brit@@ ains employ professionals , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe gave rise behind
this leads to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which will be opening on tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time King@@ F@@ isher is close to 60 B &amp; Q outlets all across the country
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Britain do not occup@@ y its hamm@@ ers and brush for a set of qualified Eastern Europeans who perform works in their home
if you are sent with a hammer or pain@@ t@@ brush to ski@@ p walls , you belong to a minority nowadays .
meanwhile , British employ professionals to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of the King@@ F@@ isher , which owns the DIY @-@ chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled ar@@ tis@@ ans from Eastern Europe , which offer services to low @-@ prices .
therefore , King@@ F@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops who will focus on skilled tra@@ des@@ men and include 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said that she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken .
at the moment the men domin@@ ate the men .
she said that it is necessary to provide the growing demo@@ graphic trends , which have more female single households , who have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; It is still working a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this stronger in a balance .
basically , half of our clients choose women with 80 percent of decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women who ranked amongst the top of a UK in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also imp@@ acted its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is nearly the only company , which owned exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including its Executive Board and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher lost a decline in half @-@ year earnings and the envelop@@ es , after the Group discussed the costs for closing of stores .
because of the trends , King@@ F@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will be opened to open 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ I / DO@@ B due to faith@@ fulness in court
at the Provin@@ cial Court in Klagenfurt , on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian volleyball tournament A@@ I / DO@@ B need to respond to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and delivery ev@@ asion .
the accused pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse during abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted in the final of this acc@@ us@@ ation in May .
the current process was adj@@ our@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the accused in the years 2006 to 2011 performed funds of associations that they had to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes .
the damage has approximately 400@@ .000 Euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial reasons .
this fact , the ch@@ air@@ woman of the scra@@ per , Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
in case of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association did not involve a wealth part at any time .
the sports officials only had lost weight compensation and sports club , for which it had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested much time and money to have contributed to the deb@@ ts - the Pas@@ si@@ va acquired approximately 600@@ ,000 S@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ ,000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood before the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we carry out the club , or un@@ lock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ th of the financial officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have poured out money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put our life insurance as security at the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association , it has been agreed : you can manage the money , but only no deb@@ ts may be made .
it is also possible - in case of corresponding financial results , the payment of the allowance for repar@@ ations has been resolved until 1991 .
this is why you only have to pay a part of the repar@@ ations for years later , namely , from 2003 , when an Plus had been on account , paid out .
therefore , the Pau@@ ls - and not detailed reservations , the former ch@@ air@@ manship rot@@ ates the processes .
the accounts and savings banks managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the association did not appear in detail , the judge asked .
the association is not interested in detail in the financing , important only the school@@ children have been so important .
when in 2011 , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 had been cred@@ ited to the association &apos;s annual investigations into account of the official investigations .
and those who have been back , declared the accused .
this account , issued on the name of the second def@@ endant and , according to the association , was not known .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
this question didn &apos;t know any answer .
and then he said , He has believed that this is the best thing for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody would have w@@ aved something of that money , the prosec@@ utor discovered them in the room .
the co @-@ accused might have been informed , jus@@ ti@@ fies the function .
this bank transfer was formulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know the judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ endant stated that he was not agreed with this wording , since the association has never been a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all from the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function , he never said a cent salary , does it merely have o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he charged the association € 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , but he added .
the def@@ endants could not be able to prove accurate documents for the early years .
these may be evaluated according to an operating examination , in which everything had been judged correctly , not more kept , they declared .
the second def@@ endant was referred to as well .
in the case , all of them must be carried out in cash to lead to the Bank &apos;s residence , as he said , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on September 23rd with the survey of witnesses .

the Hungarian Police at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ sives have used the Hungarian border against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced violent assault on the bor@@ point of violence .

time of Decision on Interest rates for the US @-@ up Bank
the world ob@@ serves if the US @-@ sheet is coming to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday come together to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , the interest can be increased or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were asked by Reuters , found that a little more than half , which would do the F@@ ed this , now think that the F@@ ed is still longer sol@@ ving and the interest rates be kept at the present level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event , because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest is on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank ex@@ its the zero @-@ area and a process of standardis@@ ing interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior manager at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy has a relatively good performance level , billions of dollars will be added to the balance and only generate low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed can not ign@@ ore the less raw view on global circumstances .
she war@@ ned the markets , at an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances for a one step are good .
the decision should be announced around 20.00 clock CET on Thursday
death guns at the Delta State University under@@ left exc@@ use compensation
after the shot and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb , wrote a notice on the day to tell him &quot; sorry , &quot; he could make him un@@ comfortable , &quot; the authorities announced his day . &quot;
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said , Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and he said , He was on a man , and someone killed him .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call , to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife in night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be swe@@ eping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in@@ quired about the attacks after his name , but he didn &apos;t gave him .
Lamb was no explanation for its shots .
as a police viol@@ ate the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , saying : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted to reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , a reb@@ ate from 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday night as polic@@ emen told him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; univers@@ ality @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , which allegedly had believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , the authorities said to give , &quot; no evidence , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was by Sh@@ awn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter that is 19 , and it was &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely Best friends . &quot;
it worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kn@@ ow@@ les &apos;s statement , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Kn@@ ow@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , that had a dog called Light@@ ning , had lived with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; said Kn@@ ow@@ les
the police said , Lamb is called up at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot;
when police officers arrived on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , later in this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a PhD from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his son of Life on the website of the University of Basel .

among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be available to the passenger for passenger passengers in the future .
the cost @-@ driven Eu@@ row@@ ings can be developed as soon as possible .
in the Executive Board , CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Karl Ulrich Garn@@ adt for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the re@@ launch , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of eu@@ ros@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airline &apos;s airline operated under the umbrella of the Passage Group , the three @-@ quarter turnover of EUR 30 billion .

night@@ time Luke Sh@@ aw from Manchester United can not play months due to double cargo
the Manchester Sh@@ aw battle was won in Manchester at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven the double t@@ inc@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
while this left the left eye def@@ ending , Louis van G@@ room won &apos;t wait for at least six months of playing , Sh@@ aw will not play that Sh@@ aw can play this season again .
the injury was caused by a hop@@ eless attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sh@@ aw arrived in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated at the field in nine minutes and the oxygen that was placed into the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later , and in Manchester went on .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - one boy , who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very bad@@ ly and then everything is happening .
in the changing cabin it had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am no physician , but if you have a double t@@ inc@@ ture , then it will take six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno c@@ ant to be happy , a red card and a suspension of a sh@@ allow .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van G@@ aal believed that the Italian arbit@@ rator had s@@ cour@@ ged .
you can judge for yourself , if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and one red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Tweet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ws account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe , how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reference to Manchester United does not suff@@ ers from Luke Sh@@ aw to defeat at the PS@@ V defeat
the United Kingdom of England has an additional incen@@ tive to recover in France up to the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our player to viol@@ ate any opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg movement , as it played in Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very difficult because it was not his intention to off@@ end the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was going on in another direction , so it looked like him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult to be something .
I feel very bad . I am so sorry about it .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was released into the hospital - after a cou@@ pler from Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly , David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents wish to learn all the parents : if your child love a book , it will not take long until you know it almost completely .
unless , you are perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked to call his favorite children &apos;s book , his favorite children &apos;s book decided to refer to the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ published ecological fork of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , movable , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to give up my children , because it always seems to have a picture or message which we have missed . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead , a summar@@ ization of the film version of 2012 returns to expand the new characters and details to expand the quite short origin@@ ality to the book .
&quot; am@@ id@@ st the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all the nature is , and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hopes to capture the heart of Au@@ drey to see her wish , a real tree , Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , and who died in 1991 , was completely unknown .
as if that &apos;s not being susp@@ icious , the text of David Cameron &apos;s text is reflected , and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hopes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ drey to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he admitted to be a pra@@ gm@@ atic Father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron is fal@@ sely familiar to desp@@ air of the book such as the local environment through the le@@ d@@ folded , trees , a ho@@ ur@@ ant , sn@@ ur@@ r@@ b@@ ying beings , &quot; which says in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , which The Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times a child .
a Down@@ ing Street nar@@ rator said that the text was probably came by Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s elect@@ oral office .
Super@@ m@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s staff was delivered , but delivered no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult .
to thr@@ ust Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , however , is a difficult task , but if you chose the K@@ ader , the England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
Mo@@ een Ali was designed as a spin @-@ gear and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on Test @-@ level , is an option for the attack .
this is covered by : Adam Ly@@ t separ@@ ating from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Test and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course , of course , to analyse as its head coach in Yorkshire .
at its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cre@@ ck@@ et@@ les are targeted at results .
there was no question mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this . players have their own top cho@@ ices .
long ago we would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had his own fate .
when he hopefully make additional barrels for Yorkshire , another chance will be seen .
the England @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ er@@ iss already praised his position , even though he did not get so good benefits , and that &apos;s not surprised me , it &apos;s mainly a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time has been a test @-@ impact speaker to set his character , is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton took nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the home opportunity to hit home and down@@ wards .
the only par@@ ach@@ ute that you can collect , was that England was first posed by Jonathan In the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales come in , and he is a mate , whom I read high .
he is an X @-@ factor of cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , what we at Yorkshire seen at a much time in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Place , which met us very much .
it must be at least the same opportunities as those received before him , but this depends on the team setting in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , mo@@ een alongside Cook , to beat what an extra spin @-@ off delay and four quota would be exchanged , and I have nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a perc@@ ussions can &apos;t strike there , and this link h@@ anders has already shown that he is an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket @-@ Players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not take his job for his county of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 testing during the first Drop , before he joined the open@@ er in 2001 .
he has made three hundred rit@@ us immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari is born in the K@@ ader than back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his st@@ ats - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unch , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainer have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few smart additions to exercising .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor for the test matches could be a master@@ piece .
he is one of the best war@@ nings of the game that will bring an abundance of experience , since he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy to powerful action into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the International Cri@@ cket competition , as player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela has insights , of which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previous said .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used at One @-@ Day@@ er , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team le@@ ver do not determine the schedule .
and you have to think that as with the players depend their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken by light .
Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = &quot; Great Britain &quot; from the EU ) could gain access at Zul@@ u when the Economy ended up in 2017 in a di@@ lu@@ te unit .
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ likely re @-@ negoti@@ ating strategy to keep Britain in the EU , will come deeper into difficulties with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ b@@ yn to the Leader of Labour or TU@@ C , which fought against Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ bit@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .

in Brigh@@ ton , the TU@@ C chose this Annual Meeting that it may not like this , if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climbed to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photograph of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , they come to the house and say that they will win allies .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who looking for looking outside the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and can look through that more and more sh@@ ame@@ ful ministers and civil servants come up to the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad@@ ly for ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also an abandoned force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it &apos;s difficult to imagine that they are a leg , to help themselves to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Brit@@ ons , whose energy should not be used , Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar @-@ separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may not plan to qu@@ est ann@@ ot@@ ations , completely in SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s post @-@ voting campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , presum@@ ed my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new negoti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; won &apos;t be gained from the proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how burned the Fle@@ et Street on its costs and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics can be the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , however , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry in 1973 on a 2 : 1 ratio .
you can remember some Boris Johnson who remember the &apos; Fe@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ un@@ ists who have made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
with all his conc@@ e@@ ability , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing counter , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners , and Pseud@@ o Non @-@ Indi@@ c , most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but set out that if you &apos;re sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one is better to dist@@ ract from , instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , mili@@ tia became more n@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air themselves , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch v@@ oters in 2005 , making him a back@@ door open@@ er .
the press never re@@ draw it before him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn , who gave me a friendly g@@ aps on the back of Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time to fail for me - appears in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ son Bo@@ yc@@ ott &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ th year , a mistake at that time and today .
it can take long but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left out on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe is - I am really friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;

experts critic@@ ise public health report concerning E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency , that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes less harmful as smoking , made of a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts working in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et so@@ vie@@ t , publicly traded in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
PH@@ I published the &quot; basic book &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the resi@@ li@@ ence of the data and refer@@ enced links between some experts and tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month brought the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &quot; that founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write to the BM@@ J and have asked whether the statements are set up on a stone or the sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ idemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health means that strategies should be based on the presence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the asser@@ tion of PH@@ ES that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; on a detailed review of verification and modelling .
in fact , this statement is made out of a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi@@ disciplinary assessment analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ otine @-@ hal@@ ic products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received from British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T concerning the Public Health in a Sustainability Report .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared that from a E @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing which he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added them to them .
the reasons for selecting the committee are not supplied , but includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes @-@ champ@@ ions , some of which also provide industry @-@ financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of PH@@ E took part in the session .
the Group &apos;s research work is lab@@ elled , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; noted Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PH@@ E report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there have been no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at PH@@ I , said that we have previously responded to the claims of BM@@ J &apos;s claims before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less hazardous than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life of smo@@ kers died at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small , however , that we still continue to study long @-@ term effects .
PH@@ E has the clear declaration to the public about what evidence is evidence and what does not mean , especially if there are much public confusion about the relative d@@ angers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80.000 people die yearly from a disease with regard to smoking and smoking , the National Health System costs two billion £ per year .
by clear proof of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of harm which is caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should be back to East@@ europ@@ e , says former head of Channel 4
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said to stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that commercial Rival &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would give their right arm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the radio charge will only be used to do the type of programs that are not sent through other UK @-@ stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for publicly that they are broad@@ ly seen for public broad@@ caster , which probably can be seen by a smaller audience , into a hard @-@ cont@@ est@@ able time window against the popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broadcast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried to get into contact with BBC 4 without success for six years .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on behalf or transm@@ its that the un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals would be demonstrated , &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to hold the radio charge , what I don &apos;t mean or long @-@ term idea for a good idea , its production should at least give programs , the others do not work or commissioned by order .
they send the Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that none else would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ dic@@ ulous , it is non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed , which could also be funded without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both to own productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
to end , I stri@@ ve to see how it should be public @-@ right TV .
I do not think that the BBC would decrease at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC School was on the hunt for evaluations , &quot; because the ambi@@ tions of the people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular parc@@ els to the BBC , which explains the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , put up in his mac@@ ro@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs could go to BB@@ C4 , but they don &apos;t even measure their tasks , and they can ar@@ gue if they can ar@@ gue for legal missions made by 4 billion £ / radio fees , &quot; Well , naturally , we have created all those listed programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one wanted to see it ever .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I ask you to find a res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can achieve the best value .
of course , you think all , think we get a big value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is correct , because it &apos;s not much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ line and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to form and maintain and maintain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little from BBC production now classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio stations in Australia and Canada , for example , investigate it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; clari@@ fy and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on TV began , and with the commercial broadcasting , Alli@@ ances in order to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des can change the direction at the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound effects .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .

im@@ pulses working through ph@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells , that are genetically modified to carry out membrane channels , which react to ultrasonic waves .
another topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , in which ultrasound may be used to activate a range of bra@@ ins , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the proceedings of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive access to the brain of human disease symptoms .
sm@@ all@@ ers respond normally not in ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani suggested that they did it , when surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasonic waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ultrasonic waves occur on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ es@@ tically and found in membran@@ es of some of the die cells .
the sound waves provide the opening of these on@@ es@@ - channels and activate the cells where they are allocated to a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , modified Chal@@ as@@ ani , genetically modified the wor@@ ms that some of its m@@ one@@ age can carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 on@@ es@@ elf .
when it is applied to the changed creatures , the sound waves are enhanced by the micro@@ bl@@ ers , and in the wor@@ ms where they switch the changed Mot@@ one@@ z@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows researchers to merge neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some benefits compared to this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be lowered from a optical fiber to the required position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound scan be un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent into the brain from top to skull .
&quot; we believe that Gen@@ therapy and an therapeutic virus is impossible to temporarily transform human neur@@ ons in a clinical diagnosis of particular neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .

eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Holiday home
eleven years ago , as a forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ality Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but now I remember the stra@@ ined smile of those who have denied - and many , lang@@ at@@ rous complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned , can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in residence halls extends from easily ner@@ ven@@ ding , up to absolutely sho@@ ck@@ ingly .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ ank you : where you get , from where you get , where you are standing on Cor@@ b@@ yn , why you don &apos;t love Sab@@ baths , because in Ernst , Bo@@ ys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe through .
and help others to do the same - make questions and show you interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out people who &apos;d like to say in contrary to those who would not speak , even when your lashes would be burned in fire , and this fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave it .
the rooms of people are often transform into beverage recipes , movie @-@ night event locations and municipal meetings , but they are also the places where humans dress up and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
thinking About this : do not think of working at the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted obtained a rough handling at the university .
her room should be a refuge and so many student dormitories form a room @-@ to @-@ room w@@ um@@ mel culture , which can be friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tried to recover themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing else in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love you and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away , that I consum@@ es the energy that I consum@@ es for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a crash of soci@@ alizing is exhau@@ sted - and send an SMS instead of .
Cal@@ rop@@ os ank@@ lo@@ ot : do so .
a guy in my student dormitories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close together through baking .
as you begin attending the university at the cli@@ max of back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck at the doors of the back @-@ mania , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve got something b@@ aked . so , and now , smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade tre@@ ats offer is a good way to close friends .
your roomm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain himself and will associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , this depends , if you are a permanent b@@ aker .
bad mixed cl@@ ums@@ y , made of flour , sugar@@ s and fat make people sleeping , if you are an@@ gling .
to ste@@ al food , is a common crime in student dormitories .
of course , the cl@@ amps of ch@@ ick@@ ens is anti @-@ theft , but is it even a drop of drops for your tea ?
check it with the dam@@ s .
the chances are well that they say , even when cooking in the interior itself .
if anyone is anno@@ ying , it &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my sympath@@ ies - but try to deal with it as my roommate when she added a deter@@ sive agent to so@@ t th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
you should make no noise , who stops the people from sleep , or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a permanent human being , but that you sit in the true sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b that sit in the g@@ lass@@ house .
a girl on my corridor asked her neigh@@ bors , if there &apos;s something to ask them , Drum &amp; bass asked something calm , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to the music using still loud music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neigh@@ bors , to sleep two hours before they left their own music , shut down their door , and went to their three @-@ hour test .
would it be romantic , if your future sp@@ ouse would come random@@ ly into the same student residence ?
and vice vers@@ a , it would not be ab@@ y@@ sm@@ al if you keep a roommate than for your future sp@@ ouse , they will take away , and you &apos;ll have to see on each day and perhaps sometimes to experience how to bring together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot @-@ roommate definitely not your future sp@@ ouse is , try at least , your under@@ p@@ b a little reason .
in an exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left its key in its un@@ locked room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ b@@ bing , when it appears .
a good stri@@ a is funny , but it takes only moments , until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
hur@@ ry through a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never sent out any person &apos;s room with ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place their keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but drives their owners during the ceiling no more than twice .

&quot; I &apos;ll show how you can still build economically and well , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees will push for the housing markets .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gu@@ mer@@ cen@@ aries to know how rapidly making houses can be created : he builds a project in the ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner ; many refugees are push@@ ing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the huge accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
due to the refugee flow we still need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a whole , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a ter@@ raced house needs the longest place .
it facilitates integration .
this is different , if you under@@ take human beings in home blocks .
each of the six houses , which are built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that many refugees speak , it &apos;s peace , I &apos;m going back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily to suit the needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ ds : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is reasonable .
do the constructions adver@@ t@@ complicated their plans ?
guil@@ os : Baumeister &apos;s constitu@@ tionally have passed my project correctly .
particularly complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ lon@@ es@@ sch@@ worthy special construction and replacement placement .
gr@@ ati@@ zed .
it is still under@@ going , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three pitches .
in the cities only the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did people react to their ter@@ raced house @-@ project ?
Gil@@ ge : who gave me provision that gave me a fall of luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not correct .
but do you not shar@@ pen@@ ing the competition for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ ner : true : we have a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but has been producing luxury apartments that can hardly be aff@@ ord@@ ed .
my project , too , has the embassy , normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother @-@ per@@ tin@@ ent mother or t@@ ing@@ ver@@ tices .
I &apos;ll show how you can build cheap and well @-@ build today .
that is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ti@@ pping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if there is ready , you can download the option to download and then install it .
some problems are encounter@@ ed after installation , because they get an error message that has failed that &quot; Software update is failed . &quot;
to handle this problem , users are recommended to wait to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght is or trying to update over iTunes .
the phone itself will result through the rest of the process .
this may enable del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it possible because of the failure of updates to un@@ likely . so , it will be sim@@ pler to delete apps if you need to install a special tool once the process is completed .
it &apos;s worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged or is located near a charging unit , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t support the update since the phone may move up to half @-@ way , and that could lead to a breakdown of the updates .

Sal@@ udi@@ s and the Al@@ ten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined the social foundation under the man@@ tle of the Social Fund and opened a new attack on Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
besides consultations , one can also participate in courses .
the Social Fund leaves it down from the mountain into the city centre .
precise to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office has recently opened there .
right beside the shopping market , from now on , sen@@ iors and guide information on questions such as care insurance or health care services and care services .
for years , we have established ourselves with our out@@ patient care service that often existing care has to be left alone .
there are infin@@ itely much questions .
&quot; also , not many benefits of insur@@ ers are not supposed to be taken , because the complexity of insur@@ ances are hardly understood , &quot; explained the new land@@ lord Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible as a senior law firm , as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Amadeus . &quot;
in addition to its consultations , the new district can also include prevention , health cra@@ y@@ ers and wellness .
for this purpose the sal@@ udi@@ branch was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers like crash prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the Senior Center and the Sal@@ udi@@ c are ideally complem@@ entary in an ideal way .
sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the veter@@ an centre for care and care , &quot; says Heike Rie@@ del , Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s .

Dr. Frank Müller at the field of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen and investing 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take care of the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen .
in addition , Master @-@ General became Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förderung in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwartz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert .
in many places where doctors are missing , physicians - As@@ endorf said : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practical field on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ ste is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich moves his successor in the next months still with half a point to the page .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened its practice again on October 12 , until then it invests 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y for the first sight when Frank Müller began to encounter his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at present their professional training at the Dresden hospital and will also take into practice this year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the land@@ fills would fit into practice well , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the couple Müller pleased the idea to run their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to experience and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also look at his own principal b@@ oss .
and so it was agreed that the land@@ fills would buy the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there was a two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller in Hanover , his medical studies followed in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .

during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ sen@@ ausen worked as a household Prac@@ tition@@ er , his wife Ur@@ sel ( ep@@ ic@@ tin ) speci@@ alis@@ es in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the land@@ fills , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to be married as house doctors .
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy go out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion the rooms of modern will look like .
we will offer more ultrasound examination , as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ GS . we need a speaker room more .
the computer was also completely renewed .
a sub@@ sid@@ y of 50000 Euros will get the land@@ fills within the frame of a promotion programme from the district ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; it shows how pride and glad are that the practice continued to continue , &quot; emphasi@@ zed by Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter of 2000 patients come to field Fel@@ sen@@ ausen , where the north German average group is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf , there is still another home practice .
a positive side effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in As@@ endorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had been found , it would also have gone .
during those who visit the waste disposal , look at the way above all in familiar faces : takes up the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the field .
with their f@@ are@@ well ends in As@@ endorf a era , after all the medicine lived there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; remin@@ is@@ cent of the jung@@ le .
a little cr@@ amp sp@@ ends her after a long time .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients in sure , &quot; says the Inter@@ ic@@ ec@@ tin .
her husband compl@@ ements this : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up until now , I still pushed forward to gardening . now this could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; the border controls are now moved at our south border , &quot; said the Minister for the Minister Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border continue to be maintained in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , everybody , who wants to imagine a political asylum request , would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can also be doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , &quot; that there will be distinct signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people must know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less migration flows , not beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would allow refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and under circumstances cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
but here did not see the Minister of Internal Affairs Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ll@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ ib@@ ach .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors may be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia rather will become monitoring the border - mainly to Hungary - intensi@@ fying .
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is strongly controlled as an external border .
as the minister st@@ ressing , Slovenia wants to establish its borders for refugees , but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government h@@ asted , the first refugees had attempted to pass in eastern Croatian by the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in Croatia on Tuesday to avoid registration .
the Croatian police seized it in the approaching ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , under Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , under@@ take operations of new refugees .
it was primarily about Syri@@ ans and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country will be around 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Moreover , B@@ se@@ vo would also lead to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously carried out migrants to the Hungarian border , reported to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , suffered that human beings to beat certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , nor the name of it . &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , during the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria
the occup@@ ants were the passengers that travelled all night of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has spoken , so the c@@ ops have said that we should come here &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
now it could actually exist for ob@@ servers already forec@@ asted shi@@ fting of the former Balkan Route Turkish @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a slightly lower distance .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for limit control &quot;
Croatian Minister of Internal Affairs , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had already emphas@@ ised that , for instance , his country prepared appropriate plans for similar exploitation of refugees .
details didn &apos;t refer to it , but it pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen area &quot; have comprehensive possibilities for limit control . &quot;
it is insp@@ ecting str@@ ingent controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have gone through a good record since then , affecting the standards of the border controls .
on this Serbian site , some 300 refugees continue to put under the Hungarian border .
according to the media reports , they have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who led to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
if the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unc@@ le@@ ar .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic attempted to calm at a local phon@@ em@@ ony in Hor@@ g@@ os : he keep the debates about alternative ships of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed for early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not have to be a very high refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could not say if they would be able to continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
volunteer for migrants about - dangerous - Alternative items
however , private Hungarian refugee @-@ workers have already started to distribute land maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are already introduced .
border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not un@@ dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian border still no clear@@ ed min@@ e@@ fields .
at the Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber@@ crime nov@@ els , which since 2010 has always reported an insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases posted on websites such as business Wire , Market@@ ar and PR news wire .
in@@ explo@@ ited information , in@@ sider shops must have been made on the financial markets .
this has resulted in a total of over 100 million dollars in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country boundaries are ultimately tra@@ pped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SEC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further bur@@ gl@@ ed in the fall continued .
most of the accused were from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators must have been acted in both the USA and Eastern Europe .

pul@@ s@@ ating , pr@@ ong life with wonderful autumn sun shine and in four large panels each with the heading &quot; Before I die I die .... &quot;
the Ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ ed@@ Aid has stopped its 20th anniversary with this promotion , and would definitely be con@@ fron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s life , so we &apos;re with the action in the middle of the city and the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leader of the Ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ ital@@ Aid is as well as questions and talks are available as for the volunteer staff .
while man@@ ly a pass is attack@@ ing about chal@@ k and to get the movement around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &apos;t leave , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; tell the war , say sentences like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;

so this public action is good for 20 year @-@ olds .
that not everyone should be public on the plates , be understand@@ able , and , it was a very personal matter .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result is mixed , financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant confirmed his profit as a whole year due to the we@@ aker demand for freight transportation and higher cost in its transport service .
the company also said that she plans about 55@@ .000 seasonal workers for the holiday today .
in this time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company intends to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time .
the share was over 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening at Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said that will earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ during the financial year , ending 20 cent less than in previous forecast .
analysts were expected to vote to a survey of $ 84 billion .
the lower price increases in spite of the increases , average daily 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January , and despite higher access for boat transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that it is nevertheless expecting to increase the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online stock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; the company &quot; gains a solid income if one becomes we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and a global trade , taking into consideration . &quot;
the plans for the holiday employment have been announced a day later than that of the ri@@ vals UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 up to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share came to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of the C@@ acks Investment Research asked analysts predic@@ t .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts were survey@@ ed six out of Z@@ acks expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex resulted in a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tisation goods to stagn@@ ate sales in its unit express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased its results by F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the final quarter , sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger parc@@ els and self @-@ insurance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the express unit recorded higher revenues higher due to higher prices , while the result of increased labour costs in the freight business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
this Tuesday , it included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
at the most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any table to decide whether it is time to take the lead for the first time since almost a decade .
above them , on an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey Se@@ ated Se@@ als is located a wall picture of the United States .
the map is a memory of fact that the F@@ ed @-@ Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues will set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold task of the Congress : maxim@@ ize US employment and prices remain stable .
but since the great recession has acknowledged the F@@ ed leaders that there is an un@@ written third @-@ term mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned by un@@ preced@@ ented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data shows that they grow solid , recent turbul@@ ence can increase the global financial markets that are already pre @-@ saf@@ ed F@@ ed representatives to strengthen these Vol@@ ati@@ lity in bonds for Federal Government bonds , and it is also just one @-@ quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing they can watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Head of Economics at the Mak@@ ler@@ ship Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think , if they were looking for a pre@@ text , interest rate would not increase , increased uncertain@@ ty about the global market is enough to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus on what the F@@ ed will do , which as@@ sures itself the financial market .
roughly half of the econom@@ ists , that were recently asked by Bloomberg , have predicted a rate of interest this week .
however , financial markets expect a decline of the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an , which shows only a 30 % chance of increasing .
this indicates a drop in the stock market if F@@ ed has increased the sentence , it is that the strateg@@ ists opp@@ ose the blow , while they promise to be a further increase in distance .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Park j@@ ump@@ ed by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 on Tuesday .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the set in this week , said John Lon@@ sky , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at this point , &quot; he said .
if it does , &quot; they would have to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets so they &apos;re not going on pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts ins@@ ulating that a rate of interest rate threat@@ ening financial markets , because it would act uncertain@@ ty , when the F@@ ed act is going to eliminate .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points to this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in the spring and early summer months , Y@@ ellen had said that in this year despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress was necessary , an increase of movement .
although the creation of jobs in August was slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market remained solid .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % over the last month , the lowest since more than seven years and in the proximity of the levels that the F@@ ed can be considered full .
wage increases will show signs of recovery .
although , when inflation settled down under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on .
but the financial markets all over the world came together in the end of the month after China had dev@@ al@@ lied its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Ne@@ eds was able to buy more than 16 % below its maximum value , as investors feared the slow@@ down of China &apos;s global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat in this month , the Dow currently has risen by almost 10 % below the high season .
for the F@@ ed representative , the market turbul@@ ences represent complex calculation whenever possible increase interest .
&quot; when the events of the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not have occurred , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low , U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US @-@ sheet .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects of better grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a lot of uncertain@@ ty about what the impact on U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economic environment is one of the main crops under the F@@ ed , so they should not be incorporated at their decision @-@ making .
but in the end @-@ depth , the F@@ ed monetary authorities in the world have become .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the then Leit@@ ers Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that F@@ ed could continue their monetary expansion . close , confusion around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ connected , by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments on other subjects , but also advice to other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ac@@ ell Kar@@ ab@@ ell , leader of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month , &quot; F@@ ed has a history of anti@@ re@@ interactions on financial market movements that are linked to the economic fundament@@ alists with apparently . &quot;
L@@ acker , voted in voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ating for a rate of interest , quoted decisions made in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its guideline by 0.@@ 75 percentage points to three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite restric@@ t@@ able imp@@ lications for growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives made these cuts .
F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis as the collapse of the market , in 2008 , Adam S. Pozn@@ an , former member of the Committee on the Bank of the Bank of England .
the youngest turbul@@ ences are not near this level , said he .
&quot; it certainly would not be in the situation where they were afraid of a t@@ advertis@@ ment , because markets herself confin@@ ed , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mandate and does not mention the Financial Stability , and until this is changed , I do not think that it should be the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life for refugees
these days , more and more refugees arrive in Germany .
to prepare a warm welcome , does not go through the dedication of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a whole series of people supporting un@@ sel@@ ve asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she has always taught with their 74 sal@@ ons .

Brazilian @-@ pedi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy styl@@ istic
the SP@@ RS Brazilian @-@ pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy women how important nutrition while still life is . you &apos;re doing this with the presentation made by babies that are painted on frag@@ ility that painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
our breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , that give you all nutrients needed to form a powerful immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are getting to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary change that is possible to do mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet weak@@ ens women on their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child may affect the immune system .
for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Bern@@ ese Municipal Executive Board approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gy@@ nec@@ c@@ law on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ park come step forward : in recent municipal spending , the elabor@@ ated construction application was approved without a large discussions .
before , the Committee had adopted an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the applicable law plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a special form regarding the roof of the roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , a &quot; s@@ ating field with non @-@ conc@@ e@@ aling first and sky@@ scra@@ per was to be erected . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , we get a wonder@@ fully large south @-@ split , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger again in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; liberation &quot; it was again around the roof aff@@ ection , which is required for energetic reasons - different from the planning regulations - below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary , because the development plan must have no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Administration as a rule rather restric@@ tive with the Liberation contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , at the gymn@@ asi@@ um construction , there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um structure at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and of SV Bern@@ ried .
costs about 2.3 million euros are calculated .
sub@@ sid@@ y are expected by the school and width promotion .
in the next step of progress the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is to be submitted to the land@@ line and for the exam .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au and moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is expected to be closed in early as planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees leave from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au with a majority of employees .
they saw the surprising plans of Hospital GmbH of the district C@@ ler@@ k , confirming the coun@@ try@@ woman Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
a decision in relation to the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ ooth@@ est on Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans should be realised , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority sol@@ ves together with fishermen and the further existing interior station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
since the beginning of the year &apos;s medical director , Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has joined the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic , has inv@@ oked a private practice in immediate vicinity of the hospital .
on the question , who should join in succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; came to the game that was ready to take over from October 1 , conducting the lead and changing his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in each case it looked for an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of offerings in the area of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and def@@ ibrill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
in the next two years Fischer , for the next two years Fischer , together with his team , to serve both houses until next year , the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which is still over 35 beds , is finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
previously , the district had been planned for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim is completed .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , joined rum@@ ours , whose house is in possession of the federal government , will soon be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close with the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there are a short @-@ term maintenance of Car@@ itas and a day @-@ psychological iat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer over the Qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very comprehen@@ sible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has worked as Chief physician for over 30 years , have not given it .
it was asked to have been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been repeatedly threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example , surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the De@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neckar lions today are called ton@@ ight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC .

a susp@@ icious day , the police have led to the cor@@ p@@ ses who were to miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
at the inter@@ ro@@ gate the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave the young people to be killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a violent 16 year old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate was missing on Saturday and fell victim to violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s cor@@ p@@ ses were found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kaiserslautern , including Public Prosec@@ ution and Police .
this is too the tat@@ too , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old dinner that actually leads to the statement and carried out the investigation into the finding location of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was previously reported on Sunday morning after it had not been coming home on the evening after a visit to a autumn in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators joined the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
with surveys in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the mis@@ sts , there was a crime @-@ thought out of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged off@@ ender has led the police then to one channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ ses were found .
according to the authorities , the authorities accepted inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation to the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the bodies to the Canal .

refugees need lodging : study war@@ ned against housing
the situation in the German residential market is stra@@ ined .
even more refugees seek a paid ble@@ aching .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution f@@ ights on the German housing market have long been begun .
with the attack@@ ing refugees and unemployed from the EU , more people are push@@ ing onto a market , which is now over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with income @-@ aw@@ akening citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable apartments , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built up to 2020 .
as a result , a study on behalf of the civil housing of social housing . &quot;
by comparison , a total of 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany .
this represents 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay as asylum seek@@ ers in one original accommodation .
many will start to the housing market and drove themselves in the long ser@@ p@@ ents in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not just in the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant conflicts in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany Sh@@ be a housing deficit which is greater than the year is greater .
currently , Matthias Günther , author of the study , is already lacking in the ballo@@ ons areas .
many professionals in large cities were therefore settled in large cities .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly for the flat market for a longer stay in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in large cities , the number of square meters per capita has pl@@ ung@@ ed for the first time in the past years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
accordingly , new incen@@ tives should stim@@ ulate the social housing construction again .
the fundamental tax rate may be avoided and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments can be suspended .
in addition , according to alliance , attractive tax@@ able depreciation is necessary .
the funding program for refugees from the National Bank Kf@@ W is now well connected for cities and communities .
a good week after the start was announced on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the approximately 300 million Euros available .
now the project may even be sto@@ cked up .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia follow Cor@@ ridor
according to Hungary , virtually no more , since more refugees continue over Croatia .
Zagreb announces the journey through Slovenia to north without barri@@ ers to the north .
however , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighboring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with Slovenian skiing Minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister for Home Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ Land of Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees travelled to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
in T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , there are 500 people on the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , in respect of Croatian tel@@ ev@@ isions .
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees on the day before the day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , will make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary unnecessary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s borders on the EU neighbourhood in Croatia .
most native media reports comes from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with Tax@@ es in the Serbian border city of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to move on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serb border , refugees reli@@ es on the g@@ f@@ ences .
for this the mar@@ gins au@@ ge another d@@ angers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance shall now quickly create a secure passage .
after the closing of the border , no more refugees continue after closing the border .
the police counted 366 times on Tuesday .
shortly before Tor@@ que on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian legislation steps to overcome and damage the limit level as criminal off@@ ences .
35 pen@@ al proceedings were therefore charged in the southern Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
convicted him to be sentenced to five years and f@@ are@@ well from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications could be found in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ si@@ ons &quot; border in total , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition .
among the applicant , 13 families with small children and two older people are .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had to tar@@ ry there .
practically , nobody has granted a view to asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incar@@ cer@@ ated asylum seek@@ ers are going to be shi@@ fted .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke at the &quot; Tran@@ si@@ one &quot; at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to establish themselves .
they collected a tr@@ ash that had left tens of thousands in the last weeks at the road@@ side .
barrier @-@ gr@@ ille have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps at the bor@@ n@@ ort has been rebuilt .
nobody wanted to find this re@@ building .
following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reach only a few refugees .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country .
around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation towards Germany in Salzburg .
the traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , there are regular groups of refugees walking on foot .
Mayor drove &quot; rock@@ ed &quot; about the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after Br@@ ück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday with the dreams , when we stood for ten people with rice off@@ ers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train with the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had unexpected things on Sunday , but because of the refugee flow was un@@ surprising , for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; such as Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the stran@@ ded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the near Pass@@ au .
before we have brought together the un@@ trusted guests only once , with the break and drinks .
we said once again , we carry her by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was , for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking at the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very gr@@ ate@@ ful .
a man didn &apos;t take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stran@@ ded train passengers went on Sunday evening in a regional train from a ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au , after the short notice occurred following Germany &apos;s traffic , but still attemp@@ ting to try the boundary .
but the regional train was abol@@ ished at the Inn in front of the border near W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border @-@ crossing is generally highly in the course .
the Br@@ ück@@ en@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neigh@@ bors take on Sunday , a Sunday later a tan@@ dem running - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends a further tens of thousands to us , it is a logical outcome of a mystery :
instead of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke at erection of structures help to help Human@@ ity , our Chancellor delivers high @-@ official and publicly the stance of Hungarian authorities in the Dun@@ st@@ aus of National Soci@@ alism .
Un@@ d@@ elling of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are con@@ fron@@ ted in the boundary areas with ch@@ ao@@ tic circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the poultry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disciples &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ nessed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a major challenge , in view of the ongoing refugees and approaching winter , de@@ cent of human resources .
and it will be another major , su@@ st@@ ain peace , security , and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quartz
Konrad has master@@ fully doing all hands with the refugees .
according to Christian Konrad , it is usual that his word weight has .
the government has used Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to set a qu@@ est for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already received the chaos at the initial presentation of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless more hom@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday after Austria , said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Master@@ performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the interior of the interior spoke of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
the company expects a total of 85@@ ,000 Quart@@ ets in the he@@ ur@@ ian year .
in order to fulfil the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations must still be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are to provide the country with 15,000 members .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s no barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led talks with the capit@@ alists .
these were backed by him , even to create lod@@ g@@ ings even for the coming refugees .
&quot; it works well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar also supports Konrad Adenauer .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , that should be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations of the asylum @-@ coordinates , also in the ORF @-@ action &quot; Hel@@ ps such as we &quot;
the platform can offer individuals and un@@ complicated accommodation .
in addition , the hopes are hop@@ ing for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of emergency , it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ f@@ ters must have a certain amount of the hand @-@ holders or height of the upper hand .
for a temporary period of term &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be considered .
by contrast to the interior of the Interior , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , Konrad @-@ Establ@@ ishes Konrad to his experience .
I am an older gent@@ lem@@ an who doesn &apos;t say without further into the face un@@ true .
convic@@ t force be his main weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er are causing any charge of the Republic , as they declared itself .
their head@@ count would like to increase them to three to four .
so far , our own survey has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz requires a better distribution
the city of Linz is currently not planning an opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for refugees .
this is not necessary at the moment because the suffer@@ ers are currently under@@ going without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for an emergency , however , further sites will be checked for their capability .
criticism of the chief principal of the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) holds a further advance in the refugee question on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer as@@ sures me that the German borders can not be sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the relevant border controls .
special prints with refugees to Germany will no longer be available .
however , the ad@@ dic@@ ures would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , she again demanded more intensi@@ fied solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that Austria also insp@@ ections Austria to its borders , is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the advance of Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a Matter of Time
the General Assembly of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Linz Industry line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production building , the quoted IT Group S &amp; T are drawn , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) shall be rented out to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IT , the smart people are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ n@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could introduce yourself to invest in start@@ up companies in the New ship@@ yard , and later that it can be acquired .
from the beginning , S &amp; T aims to co@@ operate with the New neigh@@ bors - including Lower @-@ Hom@@ er promises a question : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a question of time . &quot;
at 1.7 million euros , investments of EUR 1.7 million were invested in the company , 3.3 million euros from the centre of Linz , which belongs to the third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is managed by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ on@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meter resi@@ dual in the building are rented for a further 40 percent .

the decision for the decision was , among other things , also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of their own site , which only because their hand@@ bags were sold , were fin@@ alised .
&quot; we are the lin@@ ical in the big room Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots .
their fashion interest has a wide representation of her mother in the cra@@ dle .

why some woman respon@@ sive with looking for a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , can also do the specialist with previous security .

the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the sc@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came out of one place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this feature connects some of the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for f@@ angs .
whether it ex@@ presses himself to foreign , journalist Rü@@ be@@ have expressed happiness or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential campaign effectively stim@@ ulated the election campaign .
and cuts well off .
it will also be registered in the Palat@@ ine K@@ all@@ stadt where the bulk of real estate companies .
the New York co@@ ats with the cili@@ atory is a concept to many in the wine village along the Wine Route .
man@@ ver in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village is about -@@ core corners with it is related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the no@@ de city , Simone Wen@@ del turned over a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man to become the world ?
&quot; I think , that &apos;s exciting , though , in her K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art , is not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the village and his famous jumps , which beside Tr@@ ump , is also a K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so having the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
for the king of the hearts , he did not take it there .
indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ces the opinion that tr@@ ump &quot; is even a bit of a mo@@ or@@ ish &quot; is , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
incid@@ entally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the radius of , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; -- lead to high @-@ rise , says it .
Tr@@ ump comes therefore out of the village of the legis@@ l@@ ature .
the po@@ ke &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated , and opened a local area for gold mines in the USA .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company were first estate sales in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from Tra@@ gi@@ k : her wish to return to their homeland , failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time .
he didn &apos;t resist tro@@ ump , because he once had tre@@ sp@@ it without permission , the Director of the institute for pe@@ eled history and folk @-@ findings , Roland Paul , declared film start .
b@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this stands in contrast to the occasionally bran@@ ded statements by re@@ trac@@ ing .
who had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border , to sc@@ out illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pol@@ arity , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant transformation of Tr@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , which was a native &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ emaker re@@ tire , he sees the Americans rather dist@@ al , &quot; he is always about thousand . &quot;
does he believe that tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pension @-@ ver@@ dd@@ ess Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter indicated that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came on a visit to the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can &apos;t introduce myself from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are better , if he doesn &apos;t like the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He does not have such radical views , I do not know whether it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the s@@ ages during the time of his grandfather in the U.S. would have been like he , &quot; he never had arrived there . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are interesting topics as it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as the President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without pre@@ sidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , who was inter@@ viewed for the tr@@ ump , have watched 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ ents , even in the USA aw@@ ak@@ ens the interest .
the Upper Bavarian village Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain village . &quot;
from the hand of the Vice @-@ Pre@@ sidents at the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Vit@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 million village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden national park was awarded the honour for tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain villages . &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have apparently felt un@@ conscious , who won the Bachelor &apos;s degree .
the woman who finally lan@@ det out at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was sh@@ ro@@ ud@@ ed in greatest in@@ sider .
and none of the three remaining girls is certainly not reas@@ on@@ ably priced , if they are the one that has received the last Rose .
but when we get to Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two to check@@ ered , you may have accid@@ entally checked out what will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps up his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have left to ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and stressed his sense of humor , ambi@@ tion , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be its partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you do , who was supposed to receive the last person ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to play , who won the Bach@@ el@@ ors &apos; heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki were both quick - except yourself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from that moment , when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were rather compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands for both feet on earth , making it a lot of fun with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ os@@ ki added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood as a pair are well @-@ suited .
in their view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house@@ visit had made her clear message that Wood &quot; could be one &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I am certainly reserved to him , &quot; she said .
and when asked them , wen wood choose , for when she was not , she was a mysterious thing .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike . it is an in@@ deci@@ ding between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will broadcast on Wednesday at 19 : 30 on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent out after its impressive open day of last year en@@ quiries .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ den for the rest of the game , as he lost a com@@ motion as it did the out@@ going @-@ Rug@@ by League converter by his first p@@ unch hit on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory of Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula decided to trust his husband and gave the next opportunity to give pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also showed his true face in the dressing chamber after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies to grin@@ d the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula presented Hay@@ den publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ th Sport @-@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by special @-@ team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey to forget him to forget his pat@@ ron@@ ed f@@ ang and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne &apos;s patented at a p@@ unch that was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota &apos;s Vik@@ ings .
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian gener@@ e@@ ders for his N@@ FL @-@ debut .
Hay@@ den left the playing field after f@@ um@@ ble , and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not show any wor@@ sen@@ ing start into his N@@ FL @-@ career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a thing that is fore@@ seen , it is concerned about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ den told the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass led to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
it was still a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen sho@@ cks attention to prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal when police viol@@ ates the proposed new constitution , demonstr@@ ating the proposed new constitution to the proposed new constitution .
the violence broke out in the town of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , chief executive officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside of police station , some of which cast stones and fire@@ bom@@ bs .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police have used lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and then poured into the air before returning on rubber floors .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floor , of which it is known that they can kill as less fatal alternative , obviously has produced a high death @-@ rate .
the con@@ frontation was the last in weeks violent protests at Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the Eth@@ nic Group expressed that new provinces will be formed in the context of the proposed new constitution which would decrease their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal known of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that would like to have a state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were subjected to violent disputes since 10 .
August , when the four major political parties signed a agreement , divided the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue was ruled in Nepal under the age of centuries .
working on a new constitution since 2008 is on the way , but the legis@@ l@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ l@@ ature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Kathmandu Convention in Kathmandu , and civil servants said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

the project , which lasted for ten to twelve million euros , has been in the discussion for months .
fier@@ ce reactions among marine he@@ aters , who came into the meeting , dial images and new details to the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , sea owner and board member in the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ ser , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ le , who over@@ looked all other bones . &quot;
he also fears like some other project critics , that the traffic would strongly be stronger by the intended size of the system : &quot; there must be whole bus dischar@@ ges , thus calcul@@ ates &quot; said Schulz
what exactly is happening on the well @-@ known area of the former Gast@@ stätte , however , is still open .

&quot; first we have to present a conc@@ lusive concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ inger .

Google Inc . ( C ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to help over 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations that reach thousands of refugees , rolling by the European nations , from war torn down and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of donations from donations to his blog .

I had luck .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis grew in Europe , many people seek help as my family desp@@ aired .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations , providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google told us that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / that doubled to $ 11 million .

a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BMI of over 30 are regarded as low @-@ obes@@ e .
you can find your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compared to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus with people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BMI among those who under@@ go this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to end of the fifth year in this study .
however , the BMI with those who do not have non @-@ surgical treatment treatments increased approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ go surgical procedure , 36 % of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus have been completely dissolved and at 28 % .
in comparison with diabetes , diabetes was completely dissolved in comparison with diabetes by only two percent in comparison with diabetes .
in addition , the outcomes had been better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de , and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L @-@ cholesterol &quot; compared to the &quot; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers over@@ looked the patients blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels throughout the period .
Hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held by 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after the surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - does not decrease mortality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also increases the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , increased mark@@ ers in BMI ( 7.4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs 2.1 % ) and marked a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that leads to a longer lifetime , says Black@@ stone says from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obes@@ e people who had killed about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that sought to play conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said , it is soo@@ thing for people who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because they say that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without excessive risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and doctors should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient is on BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have too long wait until we take people so seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated this genetic changes , their body is firmly bound to obes@@ ity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not record all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader called on violence to end violence in the hom@@ etown of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech by the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which dev@@ otes itself to eth@@ ics .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity must be submitted to the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he emphasi@@ zed that the reaction of West European countries on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation isn &apos;t appropriate .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tack@@ ling the crisis , he emphasi@@ zed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to deal with several thousand refugees , wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for which Muslim countries can be created , &quot; he stressed .
finally , we must think about how the killing is decreased in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence , and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terror attacks of 11 September and issued a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to sol@@ ving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his mo@@ tives were good , but there was power , and that brought about unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of ing@@ es@@ of fer@@ ment disinfect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
tox@@ ic@@ ation centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , who swal@@ low alcoholic and san@@ iti@@ zation , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , cases of income of hand @-@ disinfection products for children under 12 years , increased check@@ ered centers , from 3,@@ 266 to 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are always more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in cont@@ acting , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children could be disinfect@@ ant to drink while some things do to im@@ press their friends or cause a mut@@ ation with social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinfect@@ ants drink only for a cheap adventure .
teenagers should report@@ edly mixed disinfect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be s@@ led by attractive d@@ ents of disinfect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ed .
there is disinfect@@ ants , grapes , wine @-@ grapes and orange du@@ ft that are pleasing to children .
Hän@@ del disinfection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
particularly with small children , few sy@@ ringe can still run to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ care Center in Kansas Law Hospital , Fox 4 transmitter , in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p to whis@@ key , but people leave this hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant to reach reach of children , and when children come , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ h@@ ai@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after earthquake @-@ fragran@@ t suspension equipment in the school , has been taken to treatment for treatment .
your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is dr@@ unk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ebook doctor , who treated them in the G@@ win@@ dler Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ h@@ ai@@ jah l@@ ates her words and wasn &apos;t able to go as it arrived in the emergency process .
doctors aw@@ ak@@ ened her over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had met the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very fri@@ gh@@ tening , &quot; said the Pre@@ toria Scott , N@@ h@@ ai@@ vic@@ s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinfect@@ ants outside of the child &apos;s range .
alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation included certain disinfect@@ ants associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , Ontario , after the h@@ orts of Ham@@ de@@ des@@ infection , which ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities susp@@ ect that the product me@@ thanol ab@@ stain@@ ed , a fatal solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol who was noted as an active substance .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York gave their &quot; gem@@ stones &quot; teaching to don@@ ate anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it reports a police report .

the lack of Sub@@ ject Competition in Scottish Football Men &apos;s B@@ aking - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers @-@ Medium business players and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there &apos;s no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland show they no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what she interests .
there are plenty of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only those people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I will turn around things , sul@@ try D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight against Cel@@ tic , but the Norwegian chef has sw@@ inging to turn things .
following defeat in Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat of 10 @-@ man in Aberdeen , which now with five points lead to clear at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic already had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of crowd are very angry , or sad about what happens .
we feel exactly so - but we need to continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need , really the support for Cel@@ tic because that makes it better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , we summar@@ ize is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged , while in the United Kingdom all in all .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period from May to July during the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period around 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent higher than that of the figures for National Statisti@@ c ( ONS ) .
meanwhile , in the meantime the occupation in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .

why I become an executive in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except for late @-@ legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen anyway I will sit in an audience @-@ gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ en@@ p is expressed by the po@@ ison injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses on his death .
the invitation was already taking place in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I vote .
when the day moved back , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agree that because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see backgrounds in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media pitches from 12 to five .
who will be selected , that will observe the emo@@ tion .
I can &apos;t understand that .
next , I &apos;ll sit beside the Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of closest friend , with which I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone lines and a half @-@ hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh often when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to record a not@@ ebook and a pen to capture what I see .
I simply have to try to re@@ mind me of all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , accused me of accept@@ ing my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
she dre@@ amed that &quot; it could have better phr@@ ase , &quot; but she still th@@ inks that it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he says to me not what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to present an international re@@ porter , in order to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relations work will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit beside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Pod@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back here again .
I cannot say with security that Richard Glos@@ en@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of fact .
but I think that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough reasons to jus@@ tify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter , which you can contact for it .
what you &apos;ll get from me is what it is called to die a man to die unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards tried to deliver him and threat@@ ens to end the race track
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race .
he directed the ste@@ wards and the Integ@@ r@@ ä@@ ts Division of racing Victoria and maintained its personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on Wednesday because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tries to do what was best for the racing , and he himself found itself under difficult conditions when it went to see the positive co@@ b@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ dress rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he could not explain .
he was kept back for the age of 18 months due to es@@ pi@@ on@@ age acc@@ us@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it &quot; view as too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say anything , and I have long been fru@@ str@@ ated , but sometimes you are fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it had departed .
sometimes it re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I would like to walk around the infected head , and I would like to think my owners , that I try my best .
when they &apos;re going to think , I do not do , then I should not be more coach .
I must think everything I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integ@@ rate Department had tried to deliver his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months &apos; Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , in a room with a man - whom I am going to ask - and give him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I am doing within my livestock , &quot; said Moo@@ dy told to Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I &apos;m a bet@@ ro@@ cket .
if this is the case , it certainly should be gr@@ asp@@ ed to her n@@ oses , because they have failed to ch@@ ase me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , official President of RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of that time and still today .
should I think that , in person , will that it be personally ?
does the RV@@ L still f@@ aint and do people make it responsible outside the train@@ ers , what is going on in the sector ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think there were , that I am .
maybe you have to take my license and run me , and I don &apos;t doubt that what I say to think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point because of which it is no matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them , and push them down to make a decision .
I have support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the Train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt screening at Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching did that he had said that he could throw &quot; his license on the table . &quot;

&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take responsibility for this full responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my cow@@ or@@ kers therefore er@@ ron@@ ed mud on the leg .
it could have happened that night .
it would have been so yesterday the whole day , so what was like that .
but it was so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the racing day . an investigation on this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bell@@ amy , added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team agree on him , since it was concerned that they wor@@ ried to be wor@@ ried about the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always appeared again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Ring@@ gles , when they defeated 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have modified in the whole year nothing in our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with t@@ ack@@ les a real centre , and this has provided for us the trend @-@ revolution .
Tr@@ ent is now for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not to acc@@ ust@@ omed to lose , so it was a bit of shock to him .
it is quite strange as this always appeared at this time of season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds of his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ie St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons the Premier League in 2010 won with &quot; bor@@ ing World Cup .
Wayne speaks about exciting football .
on Saturday evening he was compared with our Friday evening and how exciting your game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a bor@@ ing team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a fire .
but now he has a team that can play and watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like those .
I build trust , because they &apos;re talking about these things , because they are a bit wor@@ ried about to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think we were thinking about the big games .
also , Bell@@ amy reveals that the game High Battle of Roo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game of Bron@@ cos against C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other trials in our game but is an exciting game yet ?
or are breaks and does not point any tension ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
if you mention us , it means that we will meet in one phase still on them .
the Storm Team has released this weekend , since they &apos;ve won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks in the final round of the A@@ AM@@ I Park , starting next Tuesday morning .
Serbia with 200,000 $ deposit on drug suit
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence has threatened to escape from 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were depos@@ ited to Queens@@ land , has been fre@@ ed over a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which took place in South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he found his co @-@ def@@ endants in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of Coc@@ aine , argu@@ ably the advoc@@ ate of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ing that it had no evidence that he had been attemp@@ ting to have the entire amount and that in the café had been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was wor@@ ried about the flight due to Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the Court on Wednesday .
in the case of criminal cases , he re@@ lied on the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ t mother and mother @-@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to reach its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reading the detailed explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone won &apos;t be enough to conclu@@ de him , not to appear , war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on security bond , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian Pass , de@@ filed with the police on a daily basis from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

today &apos;s power : every two years the car will show off their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , primarily for the compact car sales , they are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are particularly vulner@@ able : some 28,@@ 1 percent of new registrations are attributable to the Federal Railway Authority ( KBA ) alone in August at this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence days September 17 - 27 ) .
many new compact models will be presented in this year ahead of all the futur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the largest premier@@ es for the German motor@@ industry is the Opel Astra , who will stand in the autumn by dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann on the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the brand core .
the new Astra is also not much more expensive due to the volume model .
Opel introduces its entry to the largest Com@@ peti@@ tive VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 Euro .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , this Hessen provide further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , one of which are also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is initially only one fifth .
the second variation will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also already at the IAA ( IAA ) .
and what about the Astra at the IAA still in new compact dom@@ tos ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitors in the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively sold in a conventional and establishing a sporty GT version .
in the trade fairs it arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .

the interior has been moderni@@ zed mainly to the inf@@ otainment system , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
the IAA in the compact class was added a series of over@@ working and new variants like the emerging Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human @-@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court ordained a former prison complex , which was placed in a small cell in the months of months .
due to the violation of her human dig@@ nity , prisoners are generally entitled to im@@ bur@@ se , if they are housed in small cells .
at a decision on Wednesday , the Federal Constitutional Court decided on Wednesday .
even the judges accepted to see the judges , if they were imprisoned for only few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with about five square meters of land between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not isolated .
after that , the man who has moved to the outside of his wal@@ ker again on foot , was laid out in a larger cell .
his term liability Clau@@ se because of the in@@ sufficient prison conditions prev@@ ailed against the Land Berlin .
but the constitutional complaint with@@ drew the verdict of the K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ an Berlin and rejected the case to a renewed examination .
she h@@ urt the man &apos;s dig@@ nity .
K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ cht decides about the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons , en@@ during the un@@ question@@ able period , only a few days of arrest for the compensation had been issued , there was a conc@@ il@@ itary appeal .
otherwise , &quot; a gu@@ ise of law would be to fear the personality of personality . &quot;
the collector must now clari@@ fy the height of the money .
the constitutional complaint was often strengthened by the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they only said in April of a prisoner to in@@ dem@@ nity , because he was imprisoned in his prison .
according to human rights , the 2011 majority of a cell with a separate toilet is also recommended .
Moreover , on Wednesday , in addition to the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prisoner who had de@@ formed a de@@ cent accommodation personnel , also confirmed on Wednesday in November 2009 .
the then K@@ lä@@ ger was operated on three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in an identical cell as in the Karlsruhe &apos;s case .
in the past few weeks , Berlin pris@@ ons were also shipped to the head@@ lines in the last few weeks .
prisoners are therefore confin@@ ed to 23 hours , ag@@ gression increases , even to blo@@ ws , because of the stressed layer should be already .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel were not occupied because of young people under the age of 19 , 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration to refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Women from Germany to Germany , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , according to the statement of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accept one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated a look at the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say back and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do this and we &apos;ll create this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes in Germany is convey@@ ed by the following overview .
according to various proj@@ ections , between 3@@ 50000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Commerce ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) annually , the next five years is needed .
this almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but above all @-@ paid rental properties : annually , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing from the rental rates are issued , and for these particularly favorable homes are also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore plans to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing levels have to be built and it would have to invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and the Federal Minister for Agriculture said that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
it is estimated that the Institute for Employment Research ( Institut für Arbeits@@ markt@@ forschung GmbH ) is excluded , that in the long @-@ term 55 percent of workers in Germany can be employed .
however , refugees in Germany would not be asked for their qualification to help them with the introduction , Claudia Walter has critic@@ ised the project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , however , whether they can work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation of the Society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there was a political turn@@ around : from work @-@ imposed on refugees to the recognition of work .
whereas previously an employment prohibition of asylum seek@@ ers given up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces that asylum seek@@ ers to a residence .
in society , too , it is practic@@ ed - because of the professionals - mostly the visibility passed that refugees too much should be made to the labour market .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional @-@ related language courses .
examinations are also showing that work@@ stations are frequently negoti@@ ated by personal contacts .
the build @-@ up of networks is therefore to view thr@@ iller from the kingdoms of the labour @-@ integration .
the Berlin School government has found that only few more volati@@ le parents can give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oted parents , it is only very important to meet the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ osh@@ bar , spokesperson for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family , nevertheless convinced by the advantages of Kit@@ a , the managing hand@@ bag is distributed in different languages .
if necessary , the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly through the large number of refugees , the Senate attempt to increase training capacity - roughly by taking more specialist education .
in the countries students without German in the welcome classes are prepared in classes .
but they are not always taught by fully educated teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also of teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from the Berlin School of School .
the German student project estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
basically , no Bundes@@ land banned no Bundes@@ land@@ asylum seek@@ ers or mem@@ or@@ ned of studies - the only exception was so far Berlin , inside , Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned his position .
in late refugees , the access to the university could be facilit@@ ated .
because refugees with a residence or res@@ umes do not get any services after the asylum seek@@ ers Act , if they begin studying .
the latter generally does not get BA@@ fö@@ G , since they are not falling under eligible persons .
pati@@ ently had to have lived four years in Germany , to be eligible for BA@@ fö@@ G until January 1 , 2016 , the division has been reduced to 15 months .
the financing , however , must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should now get BA@@ fö@@ G .
Islam will in future be a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is important part of their identity .
the state should succes@@ sively develop the same rights as they have churches , and the existing government @-@ churches to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship .
the creation of a Islamic @-@ welfare cover would be professionally concerned about new arrivals .
obligations also belong to the rights .
so the representatives of Islam have to be simple and ready to collabor@@ ate with the state in many areas and to create certain control possibilities .
this also includes the read@@ iness , provision@@ ing against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Ch@@ air@@ woman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed fears , religious conflicts could also be registered in Germany .
those who wanted this conflicts in Germany wanted , &quot; immediately they have the right to feed here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposes to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
for future integration , much more than today will be a theme of the whole society .
this means that the majority of the majority shall ad@@ min@@ ish , the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more urg@@ ent .
Germany indeed has - as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination legislation and General Gender Equality Act .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , like the NSU @-@ murder @-@ series , in which police and government igno@@ red the rac@@ ist motive .
same opportunities for all : what floods organizations and advoc@@ acy groups are long des@@ iring for long and why international agreements have become reality when the country will remain peaceful as well as its new citizens should benefit their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care for medi@@ cally @-@ awa@@ ited refugees , trouble @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning man@@ - power and capacities we create , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money to the system are flowing .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery offers to all the start at the registration of health .
services provided may be rep@@ uted later by the federal states .
and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limitation of the catalogue to see the asylum seek@@ ers Act .
otherwise , doctors make before creating the language barri@@ ers .
previously , the Berlin Hair scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has already been proved , migrants are wor@@ sen@@ ed by ill@@ nesses on their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics or doctor &apos;s offices , the interpre@@ ting costs would have to be counted .
many refugees too could also be helped with more general medical start @-@ ups in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
there is a much more common disabilities under refugee camps , and in the young people go to HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with some other cases of disease , German doctors have become clear of her education , however , Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite rebellion or tuber@@ culosis cannot be severely affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and concerning the trouble @-@ creation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; is &#93; impossible by the refugees , in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , some refugees , even physicians .
in order to practice , however , they would have to re@@ prove their qualification and lie in different tests .
according to estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ ist Co@@ at ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , at least half of those who come from Germany are psych@@ ologically ill : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or under depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially viol@@ in@@ aries are refugee &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the TU München was published that each fifth Syrian refugee law@@ suit is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a traum@@ atic stress disorder is suff@@ ers , among others , the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breath @-@ not , diz@@ zin@@ ess , heart @-@ fire and death fri@@ gh@@ s .
further symptoms are bed@@ - and concentration problems , strong carp@@ entry and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic symptoms , early diagnosis was necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill displac@@ ed refugees have a psycho@@ therapy .
in fact , psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can establish a request for psycho@@ therapy , but usually takes several months .
Moreover , in the Social Doc@@ s , Sach@@ tler or Doc@@ tors , who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this frequently lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
man@@ ne@@ sts to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst lay back on the traditions of circ@@ us art . &quot;
the goal is to drag any age group into the spell of int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ised ac@@ rob@@ atics , wildlife and m@@ ali@@ asing entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites the circ@@ us on the bri@@ cks to clean the dreams .
&quot; our passion is the Circus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine having to live without my circ@@ us family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ eg@@ o@@ tion .
for more than 33 years , the Circus is in the hands of the family of Pro@@ bst .
the gift to insp@@ ire the family , so in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , it is important to take away people from their everyday people and bring them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasi@@ zes the 27 @-@ year old Junior Squ@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ en@@ ologie with World city @-@ Fl@@ air , &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , calls his concept .
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour of this fl@@ air can now be experienced .
the Circus is convincing by talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international circ@@ us festival in Monte Carlo , Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ low@@ n Family attrac@@ ts the audience with w@@ it and charm in her spell .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their hand@@ work .
it wants to record the Cuban duo with the her@@ oes of the silent films .
light@@ ness and mobility - identify with these words .
the hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer the storm &apos;s storm .
except through numerous sal@@ mon sal@@ ts the ac@@ rob@@ atic of the Circus Pro@@ bst also proudly shows your finger feeling and laughter .

Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and becomes somewhat different and fascin@@ ated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasi@@ zed Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
mis@@ use in the attitude of circ@@ us are only too often topic at various animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if we do not keep our animals well , we do not go well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string of string .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are called lov@@ ingly , will be read from the eyes after possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to co@@ operate with the animals and have fun with them .
doesn &apos;t that animal feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go to the circ@@ us too .
so the top level is good : care for animals .
specifically designed for your Zeb@@ ra Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ st@@ allion and a Zeb@@ ra@@ st@@ ute , the family certainly proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a walk and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small Jum@@ bo da , &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the z@@ eb@@ ox is not ready for the circ@@ us , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
that would be something for every viewer .
&quot; one is safe , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and with your whole heart . &quot;

Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and split the computer and printer business to its faster @-@ growing company hardware and service operations .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable more competitive , more sustainable cost structure to the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive that will direct the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is smaller and more focused more than HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are positioned better than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ revenue and will be on the deployment of so far @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for enterprises , &quot; says an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was established in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , in order to produce electric plants and whose Palo Alto was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has established a massive restructuring process to cope with the turning of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on belief that narrow @-@ focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates have to stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the ver@@ ge Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation after plan is done , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario is already assum@@ ing that wild animals want to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history is certainly uncer@@ tain for the next summer .
the great dis@@ grace with this recent problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had completed the last season after a separate pressing of Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les , and then back to its old swing had been found during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not endanger@@ ing the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is one bone , which does not sound well .
this is no bigger case .
this was only an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in contact with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries , which he had before .
this may be true from purely medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere under six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als than 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en during the last five hours .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six terms in 2007 / 08 , which have experienced most vulner@@ able days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ype , Arsenal belie@@ fs that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate during the last season occurs .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from injury , you have a sus@@ cep@@ tible period of time to gain a time in which you need to strengthen your body and combat strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome them .
I hope to stabil@@ ise his body , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will through a career of fashion , which he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against T@@ ott@@ enh@@ am Hot@@ spur at the next Wednesday , and turn turns one press within the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not left for Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta must start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to maintain a balance and to players who need it , a small blu@@ epr@@ int &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are clear favorites by Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing grounds , with the largest en@@ roll@@ ment effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , based on the Richter scale 3,2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is in mind that Arsenal had drawn up the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and ab@@ ides by the far hope to lead the association to its first European @-@ European triumph .
&quot; this drive is immune , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it never worked with ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship feast : the com@@ edy show that told us serious lessons on male friends
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in regard to that , as the need for men to open , now even more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ moral among young men at a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men at the age of 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there are three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ cial ( CA@@ LM - Campaign against an inv@@ ul@@ able life ) 2015 , announced the year of the man to ask the aim of asking for the culture in question , if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms felt that when the l@@ ump@@ tions had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of com@@ es@@ ake doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends provide the risks of mental problems .
but of course we only have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of over social media , communication with their focus on substance is often more important than a meaning@@ ful contact with regard to substance .
our digital life have the need to show strong , li@@ fes@@ tivity , and successful , doubles , even if in reality the insulation has been dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists Ex@@ tr@@ ab@@ olic values say ; money , image , social status , all at exp@@ ense in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health too much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ ors and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money , luck can really not buy .
the beautiful with friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but strengthens by his personality , the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments of ho@@ ists in cozy S@@ ack@@ les and the lon@@ ging from Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can refer to everyone , even if they often return to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a employee of telephone conference , it explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening position for people who are de@@ pressed and sel@@ fish , as even the smallest interactions among friends may make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel themselves not in the position to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old re@@ organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it becomes a weakness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one speaks regarding problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me in the sense , if I try to offer long @-@ lasting mechanisms .
she presents itself clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friends .
so very my objective outw@@ ard status via the phone has also help people in ophthalm@@ ology of desp@@ air , while the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you &apos;re visiting this weekend Com@@ edy Central friendship with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends with a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks or sit alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference might make your friendship .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ ship Fest
di Maria meets , to help PS@@ G to grin@@ d Malm@@ ö
angel Di Mary celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani following his search for Malm@@ ö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , PS@@ G will compete in Malm@@ ö with his debut at the Champions League .
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Mary and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani took part in Paris as Paris Saint @-@ Germain to celebrate its Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö on Tuesday .
di Maria met in less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , which brought the French champion to the way , but thereafter , they missed a series of occasions before finally achieved a head ball@@ ector in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Don@@ et@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A required Paris a strong start against Swedish champ@@ ions , since they do not only need the qualification for the K.@@ O.@@ K. rounds , but an improvement on the way towards the quar@@ ter@@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got their points , it was no chance of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ in@@ ov@@ ics before the gate . he later became in play against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the association , which he began to rev@@ ise his illustr@@ ate career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or under@@ go in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause and relaxed re@@ structured , even if there are certain things that we need to perf@@ ecting in the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that &apos;s a good sign .
we wanted to win and we &apos;ve won , although I am sorry we did not have scored one or two further goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ in@@ ovic returned to his violation in one of three changes into the Paris team , which was able to keep a 2 : 2 accident at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was run by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian cli@@ ck@@ ery was named as the man , who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he arrived in Manchester United &apos;s last month before , when he arrived in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ a Pass behind Malm@@ ö @-@ Defence , before joining Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would have a big victory that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic proposed in a Play @-@ off stage to att@@ ain this level , entered the field with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field ri@@ ves a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who drove far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s pole in the 34@@ th minute , they gave little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself had sometimes im@@ planted , with some lack of false post@@ ures and bad abst@@ rac@@ ts , not in the first half of the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani started trying to re@@ launch it after rest@@ art .
nevertheless , he reported a lot more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ player , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ in@@ him@@ on , who was named Di Mary into a shooting , which led to the pole of Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate was finally fell short after the hours @-@ brand thanks to the Cav@@ ani . Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth half of the season when I@@ bra@@ in@@ him@@ oth had gone up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this has ended all thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and just an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz , was able to keep the end result in order to be replaced by E@@ z@@ equ@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave a class that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we only played in the Swedish League that did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications do not work out . &quot;
hut from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented his change from Bayern
world and European Champion X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar for summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously stood opposite a few years before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for FC Barcelona .
eight time of Spanish champ@@ ions , three times winner Champions League winner , two time World Champion , two time European champion , the time World Champion , the title list of X@@ avi is stun@@ n@@ ingly .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi is now env@@ y that he was standing before the EM 2008 before the f@@ are@@ well from Barcelona .
&quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça could sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything , we didn &apos;t &quot; tell . &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a special offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ s@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann acquired the FC Bayern .
gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi is not changed
but the change came not .
and the decisive man for this date works for the German record : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça launched Gu@@ ardi@@ ola with the contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP said to me that I would not change , that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that makes me tro@@ ll@@ ed me . &quot;
who knows how the Bavarian season 2008 / 2009 was gone with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire length on the lawn , split the Red Army ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated its triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the movie format
matt Dam@@ on actually con@@ fron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ American filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown presented a discussion about the diversity and said they are not needed behind the scenes .
during a row of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown related to this the need of alternative perspectives and in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we &apos;re talking about diversity , do they do with the occupation of the film and not during the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ sured Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with offensive un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the author &apos;s comments den@@ ced by the Mar@@ tian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &apos;s Ben Le@@ bac@@ on and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I wish to remember thinking about thinking - who is always the director of the harmony - as she said the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown .
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line which is beaten by white col@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People continued by Leo Angel@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ cio for direc@@ ting rights at the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on told us that her direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something , what we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was transmitted , the social media was explo@@ ited against women &apos;s comments .
Mr Po@@ oni , Mr Po@@ oni , pressed his anger on the clip that he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain it so much - this is SO WE@@ ISS that it &apos;s h@@ urt . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 L@@ ikes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the top of social discussions .
in 2014 , after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves Matter was achieved and encouraged by the legis@@ l@@ ature and authorities for discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured amb@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments .
in February , the singer Prince showed herself on the motion during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year with the Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alb@@ ums quiet@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

so very suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine how that &apos;s ... the future is unknown .
leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finals and why Br@@ itten , though he finished first at all at all , not any prize money .
according to the rules , money is going to be the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , there will be one of the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changed , it preser@@ ves the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think it swe@@ eps across some of them .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he did .
masses of awards he received from fans .
he is so a great guy and a family .
he is a hero for his sons and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac could just feel like , if they would have lost the roles .
America Ninja Warrior is extended for an eight @-@ season , which will start fil@@ ming soon in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers dri@@ ck on Minnesota &apos;s Twin@@ s
MIN@@ N@@ EA@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not too funny at the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today , there are the tiger on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to her role as spo@@ iler , but in this part he performed perfectly against Minnesota &apos;s Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the Twin@@ s w@@ ished a chance to climb within a playing of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , even though only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter R @-@ word which was so difficult to gr@@ as@@ p over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter what it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager &quot; Brad . &quot;
tiger @-@ pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early @-@ offensive support when Detroit achieved three times in the first two cour@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times on the 1 / 3 inside and paved for three reasons .
it wasn &apos;t its third successful start into his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to concentrate completely on the game .
Commissioner @-@ designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rings , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first hit @-@ hit from Mart@@ ine@@ z , when he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has sh@@ ak@@ ened the lum@@ ber well , &quot; said bal@@ m .
he looked good at ( stroke strength ) , saw a bit better off the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three edges in the hinter@@ land at the end of the seventh inside the Twin@@ s had its best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon carried his second b@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier for Stri@@ ke@@ out , before he was replaced by left @-@ handed b@@ la@@ ine hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y exceeded , the only man , con@@ fron@@ ted with whom he was con@@ fron@@ ted with the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who was working with the right @-@ handed rotation Tri@@ m Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of le@@ pers and the closing @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen stopped the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the major league in the Major League leading 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ chers struck a Double Play .
after Detroit going a Insurance Run in the end of the ninth place , the wall mounted a R@@ BI @-@ double against the lack of tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved a stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed sp@@ ach nevertheless S@@ ano with three pitch for his fifth save .
Detroit starts to kick off the action of a still not mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
in the presence of town President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a far @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill , was christ@@ ened on the name of the German reform .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is honoured as the &quot; German The@@ olog@@ ian of Christianity . &quot;
the park lies right in the heart of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was first proposed by the &quot; Protestant Churches in Rome . &quot;
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants were able to live in the city of the pop@@ es over centuries , often only in secret their faith .
in a symbolic way , it is more visible that their tradition of Christian Faith may be welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) worked as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he received the city then as a perfect sin cable .
his negative impressions were probably meant to rein@@ force him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then had directed the split by the evening in the evening with his theses .
Hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus having painted ( gold @-@ plated ) is one of the main works created by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost is updating the implementation and publication texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal interpre@@ tations of bib@@ lical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms got the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but by no means is syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , the topics are adapted , this can absolutely clean@@ se quite dark .
about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project which he has made a subj@@ ective artistic selection from the many themes of the book of all books . &quot;
arose cycles , which are subject to themes such as crosses , pl@@ agues , Command@@ ments or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood .
this brings spont@@ ane@@ ously several partners immediately : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and it is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , which inter@@ viewed on the basis of painting with the respective bib@@ lical locations .
it interpre@@ ts the Bible listed by Ot@@ mar Alt in the Bible and thus translated into current cont@@ ex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are the verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
in 1989 , they are located between Martin Luther and Martin Luther &apos;s original Bible , and in a set of the artist &apos;s personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord strap has gold letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old also allows a deep insight into his soul and its emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de , born in Berlin in 1940 , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant background Knights .
&quot; the up@@ bringing has already been with the cane , &quot; reminds Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up trying to bear me maybe also with the Lord father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help to re@@ lie@@ ve art in faster life again : &quot; the perception of visual worlds has been shaped today by advertisement , and that &apos;s lou@@ dly .
symbol@@ ism is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and gu@@ ises , to show things .
pictures always have a little in@@ valuable and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to have the look into the images &quot; come down , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is for his counter@@ act . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was born on Tuesday , at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art &quot; : &quot; I like living with his paintings . &quot;
old didn &apos;t care to capture the Bible completely , but chose ec@@ our@@ sel@@ ing themes that are important for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the pictures , the text is explained only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deep@@ en life and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both ( bib@@ lical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - first presented in an exhibition that is opened on the 15th of November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .

the approval will arrive in October . Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock was first to communicate in the children &apos;s and Youth committee .
&quot; I hope that this year &apos;s even clear@@ ed , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga begins a significant sign on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to its respon@@ ding location in Germany and guarantees policy to help the management of upcoming problems .
&quot; I have this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle , that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in every individual interest in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and visit the State Minister for Transport Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; surely the topic certainly will play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football can help and wool .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must constitute the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football League has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some Federal Lig@@ ur@@ ists support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ages take a clear sign when used in the left Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ our@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Hermes ) . &quot; we can help the &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make clear that all they are to help out where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport Director Rud@@ i Compl@@ et@@ ely of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ granted &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; refugee tragedy goes to everyone , there is none to see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football coun@@ selling , no , we must use our radiation power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees , who already suffered unbelie@@ v@@ ably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms CEO Peter Ret@@ tig promised from a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
for the EM @-@ qualifying match against Hungary on this Friday , the national women &apos;s national team will invite 100 refugees to Halle / Saale
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support for refugees as &quot; a large communal department of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements have started their own projects in their locations , be great .
equally great is that small and smallest societies are involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we have spent , is living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s of great importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association will be exhibiting together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government faces 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have set up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

after the accident at the stairs in the house of his brother in the US , it fell to midnight on a water @-@ glass , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ver@@ bi@@ per@@ ed , has been wo@@ ke up to the road - that has he so t@@ elling us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the W@@ IW@@ O &apos;@@ SAP @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we met before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old Manager was able to work and work perfectly with the meeting .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , and will come to Germany again in October .
&quot; I am full for SAP since I was full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally , I spent the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its leader Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer it has not been more in the German SAP headquarters in Wal@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can do something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to rise again when you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot attack him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ game against Le@@ verk@@ usen by BV@@ B @-@ Coach : &quot; we expect a return from him to practice on Friday . &quot;
in light of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or position on the Re@@ us position .
he announced his appointment at the go@@ al@@ keeper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place on the place of tri@@ bal Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; the soccer teacher praised the world champion .
but Tu@@ ch@@ el would be open , however , if the ref@@ us@@ al in the future is to play in all Europe @-@ league games .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
the search statement by Mit@@ vin Re@@ us that the final entry for the BV@@ B will be the goal of the European League , will hold mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understand@@ able : &quot; that &apos;s Marco not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to complete the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead a pioneering role in Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany should be a for@@ erunner for the change of the cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ ate International Motor Show .
automated driving and networked driving will increase road safety and provide for less stable , Do@@ br@@ in@@ dt said .
he wants to discuss the topic also with his colleagues from the G7 states , bringing together representatives from industry representatives to the IAA .
among other things , the corporate strategy of the Ministry of Economics under@@ lines the importance of mobile broad@@ casts and an easy re@@ leg@@ ation to digital audi@@ ot@@ ters .
testing of new technology is currently construc@@ ting a test track on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks should be considered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions and , where needed to adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , Germany wants to ensure that the allow@@ able maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km per hour .
furthermore , the Federal Government wants to use the Vienna Convention for a change of the Vienna Convention , which has only presented human beings as a driver .
in automated driving , the car will increasingly take the lead , the driver will become more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
after a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
nevertheless driving less vehicles on public streets are only expected to be expected in 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site greatly appreciated the revenue of the study by 2025 to around € 8.4 billion .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can result in more safety and efficiency across road traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ traffic police S@@ ören Bart@@ ol .
however , the question of liability in accidents and security of personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey on the site of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Testing of Testing , comes to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will have gone through the next ten years , 32 percent pay only in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed by 2025 w@@ alled 33 percent by 2025 .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .

on the free@@ way , traffic could be seen at least 15 per cent , while traffic was 45 percent .
well every vote would not leave the car under no circumstances .

Gaul@@ tier feels to be old for a enf@@ ant
a mixture of quite large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) will be presented to an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that are terri@@ fying thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they contribute to the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , amongst others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits on the big star of fashion scene - and therefore that he had tast@@ ed men in skirts .
&quot; I &apos;m no longer able to say that I am the enf@@ ant for the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was ble@@ ached , and today it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for visitors from the exhibition &quot; From side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to see from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , his post@@ pon@@ er has under@@ gone his post@@ pon@@ ent attitude to a look at his person .
actually he had been , for me , for : &quot; for me a little bit after death , &quot; he said .
when people die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously done in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a lot more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give insight into that hardly visible work of man , which has written in fashion , without having completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically , the spectac@@ le is not established , but it &apos;s a well @-@ chore@@ ographed overall artwork ; for which effort was powered : to Fr@@ ze the doll@@ s , for example a styl@@ ist is committed .
14 tons of material have car@@ ved the hat@@ ch according to the course of the Cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Ok@@ tober@@ fest there was another special focus : a leather h@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ set .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he always car@@ es for strong women ( &quot; women &quot; sp@@ aci@@ ers as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of Gaul@@ tier Teddy was shown at the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate modified chassis attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was no good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) I attracted the Teddy B@@ HS and dresses , said Gaul@@ tier .
playing with a doll to play , his parents would not allowed him .
hi@@ ther@@ ing in fashion , he later joined himself .
he ste@@ ady fashion manus@@ cri@@ pts and saw the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
but later I bought it naturally .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they got nothing , but the clothes have kept .
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ins - Pl@@ au@@ ener as fashion accessory
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dered machines and to store it for about 50 meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were made in great quantity for customers that they worked on ceilings and she@@ ers .
today , the alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Civil Code Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important .
in the initial hours of the present tip , fashion plays a major role , then was pushed out by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
REIN@@ HAR@@ DT calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as pockets and for regional costumes .
even the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion that leans on past leg po@@ ets , an increasing contractual performance .
who is no longer operating in the textile branch in Germany , is no longer on the market .
they already make half of all the contracts .
Mo@@ vers Pl@@ auen is co @-@ built together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may bear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , about 80 percent of its turnover has been broke .
private business transactions and wholesale , there are almost no more wholesale .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
the mass commod@@ ity are produced much cheaper nowadays in the Asian region , and almost exclusively sold through chains .
in addition , growth weak@@ nesses , current to Russia and the US .
there are sufficient reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to point through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery to Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since that year , we perform a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally compatible . &quot;
REIN@@ HAR@@ DT supplements : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt has taught at the Schnee@@ berger State University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the fac@@ ulty of applied arts - specialized in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to compl@@ ain the competition from Asian countries , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
there is a voltage panel between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think primarily economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore an existing design often only varies slightly , to keep a customer base .

the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold medal in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt left his inspiration : &quot; before that I couldn &apos;t start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener . &quot;
now they use the top @-@ top for its jewelry .
they character@@ izes the pattern in silver in a complex process .
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
they also supplies in the USA , to Australia and Finland - mainly to customers who have lived in pl@@ under@@ ing and surroundings and want to track a souvenir .
in this way I look at my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the Pl@@ au@@ ener .

EU wants to double mercury border in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large @-@ scale fish@@ eries , making it significantly higher dose of the thr@@ ust consume .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding EU paper , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of industry and environmental policy are passed with full force , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , they are supposed to increase the limit value for large fish at the end of the food chain like e.g. Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish on &quot; economic policy &quot; from one to two milli@@ gram of mercury per kilogram .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are so strongly affected with mercury that the limits on the current limit values are not sold for around 50 per cent of the fin@@ s .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values only 14.5 percent would be available .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to limit the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this but as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller peace fish , such as car@@ p usually are so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
therefore , the ab@@ duction of small nation is , therefore , &quot; a per@@ n@@ ave app@@ er@@ man@@ eu@@ ver , helping the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is one of the most highly toxic heavy metals connected to the food chain in particular , particularly in cat@@ fish @-@ fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small quantities of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could cause particularly small amounts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry declar@@ es its homepage with regard to the valid limits that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population is not expected . &quot;
mercury is primarily attributable to coal burning in the environment .
according to a diploma from German Federal Environment Ministry , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck led over six tons of mercury in the German federal environment , two @-@ thir@@ ds of Germany &apos;s total capacity in Germany em@@ itted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fishing around the river Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lasting and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had been cited from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , apart from mercury in fish , there were already the most common reported healthcare risks in the EU war@@ nings system RA@@ S@@ FF .
