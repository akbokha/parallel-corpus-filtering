Ab@@ ili@@ fy is used to treat medium to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine .
injection solution is used for rapid control of gest@@ ed un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral in@@ gest@@ ion is not possible .
both ill@@ nesses can be used to take the solution or the melt tray for patients with hat@@ ching of tablets difficulty .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the dose of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this imp@@ airs signal transmission between &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol is probably mainly called &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and Dop@@ amine , but in smaller size than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
da Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder plays a role to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psychological or man@@ ic symptoms and re@@ occur .
the effectiveness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy that re@@ occur symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to increased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , Ab@@ ili@@ fy was over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy and Plac@@ ebo was compared to 160 patients , with whom the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with ab@@ ili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , which suffered from gest@@ ed un@@ rest ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
the company also carried out studies by investig@@ ating how the body absor@@ bs the melting tray and the solution for inclusion ( decre@@ ases ) .
in the two trials with injection solution showed patients who received Ab@@ ili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger pun@@ ishing symptoms of un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
when applying bi@@ polar disorder treatment in four of five short @-@ term clinical symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the re@@ occur man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered to an existing treatment .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses have also been more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of Ab@@ ili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( un@@ checked ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , vom@@ iting , Nau@@ sea ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( increased memory production ) , tired@@ ness and exhau@@ st@@ ion , o@@ rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of ab@@ ili@@ fy in treating sch@@ izophren@@ ia and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode of patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes , if an oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the transport of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of equal to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at an allowance of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness at dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors just@@ ify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ ent dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovas@@ cular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium in@@ far@@ ction ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , terms of hyp@@ ot@@ ony drugs ( dehy@@ dr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ absor@@ bing drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acc@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that a year or less digest@@ ed , there were occas@@ ional reports during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol appearing .
when patients encounter@@ ed with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y the patients of signs and symptoms of late dy@@ nasty occur , should be weak@@ ened to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient has developed signs and symptoms that have penet@@ rated a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be dis@@ continued .
for example , Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol was to be used in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at random , which are related with caution .
56 - 99 years old , with Ari@@ pi@@ ent in patients with psych@@ osis were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for unwanted zer@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol treated patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases , associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who have been treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients that allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding the deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels .
a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar managers , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effect is known and could lead to severe complications .
because of the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol is used in combination with alcohol or other central medicines such as seals ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers an effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased by 107 % , while C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and therefore , similar dose reductions should be made .
for CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier can result the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible metabolism .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should weigh out the potential risks for patients .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eases , should have similar effects , and therefore , similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dose height before beginning of the companion therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be given together with a moderate increase in the arith@@ met@@ ic concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( o@@ me@@ pra@@ zol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients would be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the in@@ sufficient data to safety during the animal , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit does clearly just@@ ify the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned , hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , to use until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ benzene has no negative influence .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks , treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ nasty were treated compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ent , and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ian episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol and plac@@ ebo with which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medical significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of the C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine mon@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol treated , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
to the side effects , which can occur in connection with a anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ical syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and c@@ amp@@ fan@@ osis , unwanted zer@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events , and increased mortality in elderly dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate over@@ dose can be observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death row .
although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol ; it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is in treating an over@@ dose of use because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol has a high plasma integration .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder through the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol showed high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ or and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ or as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ders and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. a day more than 2 weeks in healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ sier reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recept@@ or lig@@ ations , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ benzene showed a statist@@ ically significantly stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in one week 52 the share of the patients in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol cons@@ ulted that a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measured values defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ as@@ berg@@ - depression rates showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ ent group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , mult@@ in@@ ational double @-@ blind study in sch@@ izophren@@ ia was about 26 weeks , the 314 patients involved a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg when an average weight of approx . 5.@@ 6 kg ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a more flexible dose of 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol showed a rather than plac@@ ebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ benzene showed no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol found a substantial effect compared to plac@@ ebo by lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in week , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol released a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on like Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar or val@@ or @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol released a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with Lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ benzene showed a re@@ mission in front of plac@@ ebo with regard to prevention of a bi@@ polar return , primarily in the prevention of a re@@ mission in the mania .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ dr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ y@@ ulation is cataly@@ zes by CY@@ P3@@ A4 .

there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis of sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop@@ up @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics found no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose @-@ study of subjects with various liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to pull loops on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , and tox@@ icity potential , the pre@@ clinical data have no particular dangers to the human being .
Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans . they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects include a dos@@ ed @-@ dependent side @-@ dependent side tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accum@@ ulation and / or Par@@ ench@@ ant@@ ric @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the average maximum dosage of 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .
Moreover , a chol@@ eli@@ x@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ations of the hydro@@ xy@@ de metabolism ( 1 to 3@@ times of the average Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations in the human G@@ alle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study above 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ itation and deteri@@ oration in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol injection is to be completed and with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol .
to minim@@ ize res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle underneath revers@@ al of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg can be given ( 0.7 ml ) depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drug may already be used for maintenance or acute therapies ( see section 4.5 ) .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was associated with the arith@@ met@@ ic injection solution with statist@@ ically significantly larger improvements of ag@@ ility / deteri@@ or@@ tions compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ benzene injection was associated with a statist@@ ically significant stronger improvement in comparison to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference .
the average mean placement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy was observed in terms of total population , but a statistical significance was observed due to reduced patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol ( oral ) showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a half @-@ grade study , 52 was the share of the number of patients who kept a response to study medication that were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % .
current values of measured values defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ eller @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , mult@@ in@@ ational double @-@ blind study in sch@@ izophren@@ ia was about 26 weeks , the 314 patients involved a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.1 kg with an average weight of ca . 5 kg ) .

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week student extension in man@@ ic patients , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ benzene showed a re@@ mission in front of plac@@ ebo with regard to prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in the prevention of a re@@ mission in the mania .
in the first 2 hours , Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol AU@@ C is 90 % bigger the AU@@ C according to the gift of the same dose as a tablet ; system@@ ic exposure was similar among the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time until reaching the maximum plasma spot was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target price after rep@@ et@@ ical exposure ( AU@@ C ) , 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies for re@@ productions after intra@@ ven@@ ous application no safety @-@ relevant concerns according to matern@@ al exposition which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zol ( oral ) to safety , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , and the can@@ ot@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data have no particular dangers to the human being .
Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans . so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane has been studied in a main study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier did an Anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
altogether in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine .
considering the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between medicines and survival compared to the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of those indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was effective as conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
it may also not be applied to patients who have n@@ ursing or before the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic numbers in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was in people with whom the first treatment doesn &apos;t show more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines , and that it must not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission established Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is failed and not indicated for a standard Anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with heavy ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ code &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy during Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 during the following series .
in sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy degree 3 the treatment is to be under@@ going until a level 1 or 2 is achieved , and the dose may be reduced during all subsequent cycles .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with aff@@ ecting kidney function and there is currently no sufficient data to evaluate dos@@ ages in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended to use children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ comprehen@@ sibility and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic form@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be set immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated once again , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ies rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ es rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly marked with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardi@@ ale inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with previous Anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line treatment or rel@@ ying cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease or lung disease .
in case of patients receiving the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ he@@ a , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ et@@ ika and sti@@ ff@@ ective means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied for pregnant or pregnant women who do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
pregnant women aged during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is pregnant , while and up to six months after the treatment is not a child .
male patients should advise itself prior to the treatment of a sperm cell service , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects as tired@@ ness ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can affect road safety and the ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most prominent important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy occurred at any dose and indication of trials occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular drug , which promotes the re@@ location of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tube @-@ indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through in@@ hibition of their deport@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ isation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma cutting into endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .

the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is assisted by data of 106 patients in two in@@ numer@@ able unver@@ sion@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated , which was given an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour In@@ fusion with a pre@@ ventive reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
when recorded in the study , 64 % of patients had an ad@@ ver@@ sely imp@@ air@@ ment ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not yet received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement in a degree of patients who lived at a time during therapy a periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy degree 3 .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for lower@@ ing Bas@@ eline on the basis of cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30 and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
the active carbon exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took place in multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an expan@@ sive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or inc@@ line binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared after intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 A solvent containing a 3 @-@ hour injection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue histor@@ ies is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed in first line to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ite ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane was the mean value for cum@@ ulative loss of urea with less than 1 % of the given total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which points to an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
over the age of 75 , however , only a few data are available , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in front of light light protected over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug medicine and as well as in other potentially toxic substances should be careful when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane should be careful .
under the use of a ster@@ ile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chloride @-@ in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane diarr@@ he@@ a bottle .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference agent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood flow values to occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , in case of the procedure a self @-@ bleeding is not possible , and with which a loss of blood is expected from 900 to 1 800 ml .
treatment with l@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases has been indicated for the medicine .
patients with kidney problems and patients who want to carry out own blood @-@ bleeding is inj@@ ected in a v@@ ein .
injection can also be carried out by the patient or his coun@@ sel@@ or , if they have an adequate instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency or in patients who receive chemotherapy should always be at the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are used before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and ice @-@ energy supplements should be given throughout the treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , a an@@ emia may be caused by a er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ etic deficiency , causing the body to be sufficient on the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ etin .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ etin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been incorporated into the formation of ep@@ it@@ et@@ ine fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to an injection in a V@@ ene as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who were caused by kidney problems , compared with reference agent .
all patients at this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were either converted to se@@ amed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ binary values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
Moreover , the company also laid the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kl@@ ed Ab@@ se@@ amed were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds of patients were converted to se@@ amed , in the same measure as in those patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who remained E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a increase of blood pressure that sometimes lead to symp@@ tom of a enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , mig@@ ra@@ cial head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be used in patients who may possibly be excessive ( allergic ) against er@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or any of other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , because further studies are necessary to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine was provided for deriv@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which produces Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , a approval for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .

in case of tumor patients , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay was taken into account for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of Epo@@ et@@ al@@ fa drugs and the er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin reply ( patients who might have to be trans@@ founded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 , in order to minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ al events with the aim of holding the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ binary between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction , which should take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger electri@@ cally orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure , if possible , prior to the beginning of the ep@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly .
patients who prefer to undergo a greater electri@@ cally orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ al and vas@@ cular diseases , especially with an underlying cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease .
Moreover , it can not be excluded that treatment with Epo@@ ch al@@ fa for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl provides increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ al / vas@@ cular events .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ och@@ ine has not been proven that they can improve overall survival compared to tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received chemotherapy was brought back when a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
is being used as a period of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ind@@ osis should be adapted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in @-@ vitro studies of tumor @-@ tissue , there are no evidence on a interaction between the ep@@ och@@ al fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .

the most common side effect during the treatment with Epo@@ et@@ al@@ fa is a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent increase of blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of the er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular complications .

survival and tumor progres@@ sion were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival among patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ar@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin patients and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ized ar@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treated patients with an@@ emia due to various more common mal@@ ign@@ om@@ ous mal@@ ign@@ ant , statist@@ ically significantly higher mortality than in controls .
overall survival in trials could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and associated complications in with re@@ combin@@ ant human ar@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin , treated patients and inspec@@ tions .
there is an elevated risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ tic events in tumor patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ized ar@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied as far as these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ized ar@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin in tumor patients with the aim of transfer@@ ring a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ing below 13 g / dl , as a few patients with these character@@ ist@@ ika were included in the review data .

if increased or up@@ heav@@ al potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ amed fo@@ amed , until the potassium values are in the norm range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure or clinical @-@ evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart failure , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ binary mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present , knowledge is not accelerated due to treatment of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age with chronic kidney failure ( kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ aly@@ sis , the progres@@ sion of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency is not accelerated .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between the ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered to assess the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor regularly specify your values of the red blood sugar ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose appropri@@ ately to keep the risk of bleeding formation ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ics event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be very carefully selected from the treatment with Epo@@ et@@ al@@ fa drugs , especially when you have an elevated risk of thro@@ mb@@ al vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you are ob@@ ese ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) , or if in the past , thro@@ mb@@ al vas@@ cular events occurred ( e.g. a deep v@@ enth@@ r@@ osis or lung cancer ) .
in case you are cancer patients , remember that they work as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can influence the tumor neg@@ atively .
if an or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic operation is im@@ min@@ ent , the treatment of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood sugar ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) are too high , they should not be maintained , because an increased risk of blood protection after surgery exists .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines and have taken or used recently , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drugs .
if you are Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( funds to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with waste @-@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain bleeding tests to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between the och@@ et@@ al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F ) and GM @-@ CS@@ F ( for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood arm@@ ut ( an@@ emia ) speaks to the treatment , the dose may be adapted for every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will be assigned a regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ binary value does not exceed a certain value .
as soon as you are set , you will receive regular doses of spac@@ ers between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equals large injec@@ tions .

when an injection was removed from the fridge and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or rejected .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause as well as in men .
it is applied in patients with a high fre@@ ading risk ( bone bur@@ sts ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic stro@@ kes like in the h@@ inf@@ ant ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should intake at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with th@@ igh@@ s should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflamm@@ ation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in treating these disease .
since the active agent in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material used for z@@ om@@ eta was drawn to the rating of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study almost 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of vert@@ eb@@ rates and hips was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a boun@@ cing . it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared six months with cra@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
main inde@@ b@@ ator for efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme , bone structure ) is norm@@ alized in the blood or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ eb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cal ) reduced over a period of three years compared to patients under plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cs ) , those under plac@@ ebo was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with th@@ igh@@ s , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are often less frequent with repeated in@@ fusion .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who are possibly excessive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other components .
as in all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subjected to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( ext@@ inction of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides clari@@ fication material for physi@@ cians who supplies the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug should be explained and referred to when they should consult the physician .
in April 2005 , the European Commission approved the company Nov@@ art@@ is Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the transport of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the entire European Union .

the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The pack@@ ag@@ ility • contra@@ indication of an adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to back up medical or care assistance .
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in case of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently taken low @-@ trau@@ matic hip .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in males , an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after surgical power supply . ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ get Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long re@@ pression period was observed in patients who have addressed to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently taken low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ min@@ ular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by using Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with ren@@ al function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dos@@ ing adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination with older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because the data is missing for certainty and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because there are only limited clinical experiences .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia should be treated before the treatment of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer sickness , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental treatment with adequate dental treatment .
for patients who need dental care , there are no data available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the doctor treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by using Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of severe adverse events in cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased by patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was similar to the overall rigi@@ dity of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with ren@@ al function disorders ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the alter@@ ation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( annually prior to administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function was similar to oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years , compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients treated from 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory conditions the temporary as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values measured in a large clinical study of 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the disease @-@ treated patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures following a boun@@ cing analysis and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures after a recent er@@ ect , the vitamin D mirrors have not been rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after filing of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study has been reported on local reactions on in@@ fusion agency , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ opathy in the jaw area Gel@@ eg@@ ally was reported , especially in cancer patients , more than oste@@ o@@ ed@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in jaw areas ) , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ opor@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer groups or other dental offices .

in case of over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can be achieved by means of oral calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year ( BM@@ D ) with either a bone di@@ mming function or a BM@@ D T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing sp@@ inal fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ ric vert@@ eb@@ rates A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a sen@@ iors significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ eb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older were compared to 60 % lower risk for sp@@ inal fra@@ ctions compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on th@@ ft@@ frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a proved the same lasting effect over three years , which resulted in an increased risk of about 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hips .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased bone density of lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ic acid , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Increase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the whole hip is 6,0 % , the total weight by 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
Kno@@ ch@@ enh@@ ist@@ ology In 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vic crest a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies .
a micro@@ computer @-@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in comparison to plac@@ ebo an increase of the tra@@ pped bone @-@ volume and ob@@ taining of tra@@ pped bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C ti@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in perio@@ dic intervals .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the starting value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output level after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the starting value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the starting value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but most of the patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D at all times as well as at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment performed more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at total temperature and 4.3 % on the lift .
clinical efficacy in males In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON R@@ FT research were random@@ ized 508 males random@@ ized and at 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated men compared to 8,7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , an annual meeting of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared with once weekly gift from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at related to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ wir@@ l @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was investigated in patients and patients at age over 30 years ago with radical phosph@@ at@@ ase ( middle ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3.@@ 0@@ times of age @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain reduction was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as responsibilities at the end of the six @-@ month study ( based on therapy ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with cra@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , during a mean period of follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multi@@ ples of 5 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma tor@@ ch quickly decreased from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid dis@@ appearance of the large circuit with half @-@ grade times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a scheduled elim@@ ination period of ½ to 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and white , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) represent probably the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of administered dose in urine , while the rest is bound primarily to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration at 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration of time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed because it is not a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , non @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 evaluated patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( cl@@ ut@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function to down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustments of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .

abstract of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is discussed , as the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) will be discussed in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) for patients ( especially overweight patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabet@@ ic medication ) can not be applied . • It can be applied along with another diabet@@ ic medication ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be dis@@ satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ um or insulin can be maintained , except for patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ emia should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s body can be improved better and the blood sugar level decre@@ ases , which makes type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients , the activity of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ p , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or Plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which allows blood sugar levels to be reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos showed an existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ p in a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo was 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 289 patients was examined , the patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin took a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in the patients who took plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of the upper respir@@ atory infections ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( di@@ min@@ ished sensitivity ) .
Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients suffering from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients suffering from liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or diabet@@ ic caus@@ ation ( high blood levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients when Met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission announced the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to transfer Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , arch@@ ed and bear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient ( see section 4.4 ) due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose variable .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or econom@@ ists , especially those with reduced car@@ di@@ aler reserve .
patients should be observed on the signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and o@@ deficiency , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
cardi@@ ovas@@ cular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports about heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on must not be used .
if AL@@ T mirrors are raised up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver cells are as soon as possible .
if a patient symptoms develop , which point to a he@@ pat@@ oma dysfunction , such as un@@ solved nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ ment pain , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver cells .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued , should be directed to the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical studies of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ ed @-@ dependent weight gain was found , which can stir in fat deposits and in some cases linked to the liquid re@@ tention .
as a result of a ha@@ em@@ bran@@ dy under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ ins by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin intensity in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fa drugs or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing dependent hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia .
according to the market launch , Thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ one , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , has reported a occurr@@ ence or a deteri@@ oration of a diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular agent with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , but ob@@ ord@@ n@@ ating doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular hole ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of adverse events regarding bone mar@@ ches from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
the calcul@@ ated Fra@@ ktur was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 quest@@ ionn@@ aires per 100 patient years with women who have been treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular events , frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years ) with patients that were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or happens , the treatment is due ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for study inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with pharmac@@ euticals , which are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ ers are not expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by the 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lower@@ ing of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the treatment of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ emia and increased insulin resist@@ ence in the pregnancy and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; sometimes &gt; 1 / 10 ; sometimes &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) .
they lead to a temporary change of the tower and refra@@ c@@ tive index of the lens , as well as other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ tic compounds .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents came across as far as plac@@ ebo , but less common than in comparison @-@ groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ics .
in an out@@ come study in patients with existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or under plac@@ ebo .
since its market launch , rarely has been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients suffering from cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
a summar@@ izing analysis of adverse events regarding bone mar@@ ches from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medication .
over a period of 3.5 years of current pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients that were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
for taking the most reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation of specific kernel recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) , which leads in the animal model to an elevated insulin intensity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ine cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ ing production in the liver and increases periph@@ eral glu@@ cose levels in case of insulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ ular Act as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years , in order to investig@@ ate the period of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was diagnosed with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of patients treated with G@@ lic@@ ular ( 50 % of patients ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was dis@@ connected with insulin , was random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who still only received insulin ; an reduction in the insulin @-@ treated patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical studies of a year under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statist@@ ically significant decline in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ents have a statist@@ ically significant decline compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined at a type 2 diabetes in a small one in 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo was a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the entire plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to the plac@@ ebo under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , no statist@@ ically significant increase in LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel was observed , while under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ ular nu@@ b values were observed .
in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de , but improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , this also improved through a effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardi@@ ovas@@ cular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing mac@@ ro@@ cular disease in groups were random@@ ized to have existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardi@@ ovas@@ cular therapy either under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or Plac@@ ebo .
after oral application Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is res@@ orted quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV equivalent to the efficacy of the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) increases and lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ active marked Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the thread ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination time of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active metabolism is at 16 - 23 hours .
the sections of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are similar to patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearing of the parent &apos;s substance is similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys are co@@ inci@@ ded with rep@@ et@@ itive plas@@ ma@@ c enlargement , an@@ a@@ emia , and reversible concentration of hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ies .
this is due to the treatment of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ emia and increased insulin resist@@ ence in the gest@@ ation and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ed by hyper@@ plas@@ ia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in a animal model of famili@@ ari@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um .
the tablets are whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
the calcul@@ ated Fra@@ ktur was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 quest@@ ionn@@ aires per 100 patient years with women who have been treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular events , frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years ) with patients that were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in another study about two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ der were examined .
in clinical studies over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statist@@ ically significant decline in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ents have a statist@@ ically significant decline compared to the output values .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use insulin .
the study was measured after 12 weeks concentration of a substance ( gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that hin@@ ts the blood sugar levels quite strongly like with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may cause hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to take place ) .
the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has out@@ weigh the risks of diabetes against the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission announced the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection pin must be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar may significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , the hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast wir@@ ling , bi@@ polar , long wir@@ ling insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( insulin delivery ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin origin ) can cause a change of dosage is required .
if the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is required during the patient , it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
some patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ sis reactions after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia reported less or differently than in their previous insulin .
prior to travel , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be referred to as the advice of his doctor , as such journeys can result , insulin and meals must be taken or taken during other times .
therefore , the physician must consider potential inter@@ actions in therapy and should always ask for his patients to be question@@ ed by them .

however , a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia can be gradually developed : • Easy Hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ sis can be treated by oral sug@@ ars or sugar intake .
diabet@@ ics should therefore always have grape sugar , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits or sugar fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection lock ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glu@@ cose that is intra@@ ven@@ ously given by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the activity maximum will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the whole time of activity is up to 24 hours .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission approved Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a approval for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id across the European Union .
when two types of insulin can be mixed , first the amount of insulin must first be stopped , then the amount of the long @-@ acting insulin .
3 if the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is required during the patient , it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ ots , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or gre@@ asing notes ( &quot; stones &quot; ) , which may lead to joint pain and bone damages .
if the ure@@ ac@@ id@@ ation is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , tox@@ ins can occur ; therefore the patient is recommended for at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even more medicines for the prevention of tox@@ ins .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( head@@ medi@@ ator ) and of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a other medicines to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems were given only 100 mg a day .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ure@@ ac@@ id@@ spar in the blood was under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily measures 120 mg of income during the last three measurements in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash , and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in history , may also involve an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of the ure@@ ac@@ id@@ spar in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also has a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ tension in ill@@ nesses , which have already been led to u@@ rat@@ ern@@ ag@@ ings ( including one from the n@@ ak@@ age or currently present po@@ ds and / or gyp@@ sies ) .
if the ser@@ um acid activity after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still needed &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dos@@ ing increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered .
in patients with severe kidney function , the efficacy and safety has not been completely investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
since organ transplan@@ ts there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ tation , the application is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .

clinical studies results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was described in two phase studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary impact point was in every study of the number of patients with which the last three monthly ser@@ um acidity &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were included .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment worth of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority under 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and Figure 1 ) compared to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statist@@ ically significant su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy under 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were collected for the analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 vs. Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 vs. 80 mg
the lower@@ ing of the ser@@ um acid resistance to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit to week 2 and keep permanently retained throughout the treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x per day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100@@ mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the group of patients with kidney function limits The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function limit .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients were achieved .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage of the ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ aci@@ al concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentrations of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years collected data from the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a plaster ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the poison gas size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the no@@ des until the month of 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.8 % ) in patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma levels increased ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma cent@@ ric time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at by 120 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase of AU@@ C is observed , which is larger than the dos@@ ing proportional increase .
after taking simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x per day , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant alter@@ ation was observed in the percentage decrease of ser@@ um acid concentration that has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .

the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or any other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and Vit@@ amins supplement ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , patient must not take place until after the first food intake of the day after taking the tablet at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D refle@@ ctions .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the percentage of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than with those who only had Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at income ( 32 % ) .
the company also laid the data contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ion apparatus such as stomach pain , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ic ( ul@@ atory disorders ) , c@@ rat@@ ory ( ul@@ atory disorders ) , c@@ rat@@ ory ( hidden stomach ) as well as Sau@@ res .
in patients with cancer hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of other components may not be used in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be applied when diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) for at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or import of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and Vit@@ amins supplement ) for the day .
the following critics are to be followed to decrease the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) of the day . • The patients should not che@@ w or cut the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not be taken before the first food intake of the day after taking the tablet at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

the doctor should therefore notice attentive to all the signs and symptoms that point out on possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ read@@ ed pain or a new or more wor@@ sen@@ ing so@@ d@@ burn the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ icious side effects seem to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms which point to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing transfers to the patient are passed and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
during large clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was found , were rare ( after market introduction ) Mag@@ i and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe complications and complications ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available to indicate whether the reset of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a jaw surgical procedure , reducing the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treat@@ ise doctor is author@@ itative for therapeutic planning with each patient on basis of an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be dependent on the purpose of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet in the next morning after they noticed .
they should not take two tablets a day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day .
other ill@@ nesses , which affect the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at Food and Drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , Ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see section 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken into clinical trials together with a variety of prescribed medicines , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy still of breast@@ feeding women .

in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change of oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .

Adv@@ ance is administered adult patients , one kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a removal of transplan@@ ted organs by the immune system .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study in 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation was presented , whereby the application of Adv@@ ance with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was cancelled after a treatment duration from a year ( by example , as often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were performed and examined as Adv@@ ance in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is taken from the body .

in patients with any hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ anti@@ biotics ( such as er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of other components may not be applied .
patients and doctors have to be c@@ auti@@ ous when others ( in particular some herbal ) medicines are taken simultaneously with Adv@@ ance , as the Adv@@ ance dose or the dose of the same drug may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation should make this medicine cre@@ ase or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systematic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to transplan@@ tation or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of form@@ ulation or regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of a physician &apos;s transplan@@ tation ( see section 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a switch to alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dos@@ ages must be carried out to ensure that system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of out@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in individual cases ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to advance , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror should be controlled from the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure was measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations both in kidney as well as le@@ ber@@ gra@@ ced patients .
careful and repeated controls on Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation under instructions to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transplan@@ tation phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , can take an adaptation of the adv@@ ent dos@@ ing schem@@ as for several days until the Ste@@ ady State reaches .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) using a dose of ca .
depending on the application to supp@@ ression the transplan@@ tation of transplan@@ ts , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ ression has to be maintained ; consistent with a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dos@@ ing recommendation - kidney transplan@@ tation with transplan@@ tation of transplan@@ tation . oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift at the morning .
further dos@@ ages can be later required , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can alter in the course of stabili@@ zation of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dos@@ ages treatments - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation . oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift at the morning .
dos@@ ing recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ oc@@ f is to be converted to a daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at a time daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at a time daily intake of daily intake 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , referred to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after a switch from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ s@@ ants at Adv@@ ance once a day must begin the treatment with cancer and liver transplan@@ t recommended oral dose for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
heart transplan@@ t At adult patients who are attached to Adv@@ ance is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day daily once a morning .
other transplan@@ tation consult@@ ants have no clinical experience with Adv@@ ance in lung , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initi@@ ate dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day , with pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ t patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and for use in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
Dos@@ age adap@@ tions in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood flow mirror in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function problems .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function ex@@ erts no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dos@@ ing adaptation is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um incre@@ ment , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended .
switching from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on behalf of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see section 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the view mirror in the whole blood . the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of sever@@ ance and toler@@ ability in individual cases of full blo@@ t @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ar controls .
it is recommended frequent controls on the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled by Pro@@ gra@@ f , dos@@ ing , dos@@ ing adjustments , changes to immun@@ os@@ lim@@ us whole blood circulation system , which may be controlled ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ ance is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ ting the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady State occurred .
the data in clinical trials will ensure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the in@@ signia are not exceeded in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the valley level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ t@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and gar@@ nish and gra@@ ced patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
as a rule , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml are usually used during the following detection of liver , kidney , and heart transplan@@ tation .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ tation / or other side effects , which can occur in the result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Sub@@ - or Over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of form@@ ulation or regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of a physician &apos;s transplan@@ tation ( see section 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which proved to be treated against other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ press@@ ants , are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation .
the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation with adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ tation in childhood are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation .
due to the possible interaction that lead to a reduction in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to prevent or other plant healing during treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea there is a particularly careful monitoring of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood mirror can be subjected to considerable variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sept@@ um hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ies was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ance .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces , are an already existing heart disease , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ burden and e@@ dem .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ s@@ va , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of a solar control using a high protection factor .
if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are taking symptoms for pre@@ s such as head@@ aches , changes in consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. for example ) .
since Adv@@ ance of hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , l@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ ented Gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase @-@ deficiency or glu@@ cose @-@ l@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption special caution .
simultaneous use of pharmac@@ euticals or herbal medic@@ inal products , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can increase metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and reduce blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , it is advis@@ able to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood mirror in the con@@ current gift of substances that can change CY@@ P@@ 3A met@@ abolic and to ensure the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain @-@ even concentr@@ ates ( see section 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction of interaction was such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid @-@ Anti@@ biot@@ ic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ ease ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies indicate that the increase of blood levels are mainly derived from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal inter@@ changeable .
high @-@ do@@ si@@ fied pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on as it is used in acute abor@@ tion reactions , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us st@@ icking the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increases the hormone exposure , is particularly careful with decisions on recep@@ tive contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and its half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of a small number of exam@@ inations in transplan@@ tation was no indication of that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ va , an increased risk of adverse events relating to the course and the result of pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

advanced is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a blood circulation disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application apply to whether advoc@@ ate for the treatment of bleeding or pre@@ ventive hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age is used in surgical intervention .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been incorporated into the formation of the human concentration camp VIII .
advanced is similar to another in the European Union called rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but it contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with heavy up to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for pre@@ ventive hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age as well as surgical intervention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood cells with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ices ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) , and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ances may not be used in patients who may possibly be excessive ( allergic ) against the human concentration factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval for the transport of adv@@ ances in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of subst@@ itu@@ tionary therapy are addressed according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ age , according to the place and degree of bleeding and the clinical condition of patients .
at the following com@@ rh@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII activity is not to drop under the specified plasma ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute problems are removed .
injec@@ tion all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during treatment it is used to control the dose of administered dose and frequency of injec@@ tions found a reasonable determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ pie@@ d@@ geho@@ gs .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo Recovery and have different half times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis to the long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ ze can not be reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out if necessary to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the administration speed should be addressed according to the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII in Ig@@ G Im@@ m@@ ung@@ rat@@ ul@@ ine that are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
in order to develop the risk of inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk depends on the first 20 ex@@ position days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in case of previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with over 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ ne@@ table well @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , it was observed after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ appearance of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare up@@ heav@@ al of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who have previously un@@ treated patients with previously un@@ treated patients who have higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected waste of the blood circulation factor VIII @-@ Spiegel@@ s was post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ utter@@ ance was maintained throughout the time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Spiegel in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .

in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with a age of 6 years and diagnosed harder to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure compared to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII In@@ hibit@@ or was established .
previously un@@ treated patients with an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the patient &apos;s immune response was analysed on tracks of cont@@ am@@ inated proteins by investig@@ ating the anti@@ bodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statist@@ ically significant upward trend as well as a persist@@ ing peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise , no signs or symptoms appear to have an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity .

based on the data protection available , CH@@ MP has also been rated positively as a positive rating , but in consideration the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the author@@ isation has to apply for another renewal application in 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited officially distributed to the Committee on Human@@ itarian agents ( CH@@ MP ) that the company receives his application for the transport of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
however , the breast , the brain , bone or female organs ( fabric that combines other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and relies on ) of it .
this is a kind of virus that was genet@@ ically modified that it can carry a gene in the body cells of the body .
with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; that has been so modified that it cannot produce any copies of itself , thus unable to extract infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have to be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and so that the cancer cells are supposed to restore normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein which is formed from non @-@ defective in the human body is normally formed to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells , if DNA can &apos;t be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share .
the company collected data from a study with a patient who joined Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of under@@ mining , bones and brain .
after CH@@ MP has tested the answers to the questions presented to him , still some questions were un@@ solved .
based on the evaluation of the initial submitted documents the CH@@ MP in day 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Tum@@ ors has not been demonstrated .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as safety of the drug .
Moreover , the company had not adequ@@ ately proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for people nor for people who come in contact with patients who is harmful .
the company won &apos;t be aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently has clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed active release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len @-@ inflamm@@ atory inflamm@@ ation ) in patients with nose loops ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is one tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be mounted on the block@@ age of the nose .
most effective measures were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ p symptoms which were reported by the patients at the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours a journal , and def@@ ended with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all hypo@@ cr@@ us@@ u@@ pf@@ yl@@ symptoms except the block@@ age of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , compared with a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who suff@@ ers P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was examined , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reli@@ ev@@ ing of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients suffering the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ der ( heart ch@@ ase ) , harmon@@ ic acid , di@@ zz@@ iness , mental pain , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ nia ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be sus@@ cep@@ tible to patients who may possibly excessive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ous agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another drug to treat aller@@ gies ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ ol can also not be used in patients suffering from hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) caused a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) or having a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe company approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union .
the tablet may be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in full ( i.e. without them to break , break , or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the fault of the defect and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application can take the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine at time .
after lower@@ ing the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be continued as mon@@ otherapy .
because Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( Mao ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ans such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , Per@@ go@@ lid , ot@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ ov@@ ell@@ ous r@@ hin@@ oc@@ op@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ ard , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collection and are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for dos@@ ing .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data do not suff@@ ice to address appropriate recommendations .
patients need to be informed that treatment in the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or et@@ ai@@ gen other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be cancelled .
in case of treatment of the following patient groups , patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension ( patients with hyper@@ tension ) patients with hyper@@ tension in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , sub@@ structure or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese patients .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours prior to performing such mat@@ ological testing , because Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ika otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or to reduce its extent .
in addition , clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or change of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme has not been identified by the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in vivo CY@@ P3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
the in@@ consist@@ ency of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine should not be applied in the pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied in this fact that it may occur in very rare cases that lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ Depression ( seal , ap@@ ne@@ a , di@@ min@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart circulation coll@@ ation ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ at , Kon@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ies .

a CN@@ S stimulation is especially prob@@ able in children , as well as breathing in typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ age , pup@@ il , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia . ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Mast@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ a as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the ad@@ ju@@ sion@@ ate P @-@ selection on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in an individual dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no influence on standard measuring sizes , including the ampli@@ fying sub@@ jec@@ tivity , or the tasks that are related to flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine at recommended dosage may cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ der or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
it took 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , taking 414 patients aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ am@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined by the total co@@ res for the symp@@ tom@@ atic ( except nose loops ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine over the 2 week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nose loops , was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in relation to gender , age or ethnic origin .
within a single dose @-@ study of the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after receiving the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dos@@ cope study , which was carried out as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four female patient des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was observed badly .
a component of components study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine after the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to a aer@@ in@@ ational tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , to the tox@@ icity and for re@@ produ@@ ci@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can be seen no particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the contents p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine .
in re@@ produ@@ ci@@ x@@ ics studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine at oral gift to rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day is not weigh@@ ed .

A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( among them four studies of seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis and two trials in patients who also had asthma ) .
the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) and after six weeks treatment was determined .
further studies were submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ tion and the melt tray in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless .
allergy cul@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decline of symptoms ( symp@@ tom points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies of Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of the symp@@ tom was after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us should not be used in patients who may possibly be excessive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe company approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with a or without a meal , to reli@@ ev@@ ing symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials on the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine with young people aged from 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the preceding clinical symptoms and can be res@@ umed after repe@@ ating the symptoms .
the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to treat patients during everyday life .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions performed in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the current usage of alcohol and alcohol was not reinforced by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied however that it may occur in very rare cases that lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us recommended dose of 5 mg daily , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events described above the more common than in plac@@ ebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ dri@@ es ( 0.6 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years ago was the most common side effect of head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , and with 6.9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine months clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Mast@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ a as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion of the adhes@@ ion of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
within a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovas@@ cular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study found in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in single dos@@ ing study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes , including the ampli@@ fying sub@@ jec@@ tivity , or the tasks that are related to flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ ev@@ ing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as indicated by the total co@@ res of the quest@@ ionn@@ aire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ St@@ ing@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , is un@@ aware of the eth@@ ti@@ ology in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
since the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all of the chronic idiopath@@ ic diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is also expected in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in enh@@ ancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus , and the number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose of dose .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine , were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax significantly , as was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients showed a greater concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no evidence for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme has not yet been identified for metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes that inter@@ actions with other medicines not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ its not CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited nor a sub@@ strate &apos;s inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .

in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol is not ampli@@ fied when taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol reaction influence effects of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us recommended , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in an multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , during which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine months clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the age of 1 and 11 , who came to a question for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2,5 m@@ g. ( ages 6 @-@ 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults .
within a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovas@@ cular effect was described .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov was to be used in adults and older people to protect the flu caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine being protected from a trunk of gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out if a new tribe of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus appears , which can easily spread from man to human because people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

should you participate in a clinical examination and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor treating them .
if you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is at disposal , but this cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r as the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be classified when the doctor has examined , which has previously used the an@@ tivir@@ al drug of the patient , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is to address the virus to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , taken with twice daily 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is aimed at the body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV amount is reduced in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS does not cure AIDS , however , cannot hesitate to harm the immune system and the development of associated infections and ill@@ nesses .
A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , but in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease .
this is compared with low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r reinforced drug v@@ ase was compared with 206 adults , previously compared with other prot@@ eases .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentration of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or change of viral load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously been taken no prot@@ eases formerly did not have had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in case of children , A@@ GM also decreased the Vir@@ us@@ last , but with the children used to be previously treated with prot@@ eases , very few in the treatment .
in the study with adults , previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , that was as effective with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r ampli@@ fied medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the viral load after 16 weeks treatment as well as other prot@@ eases :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eases , it came together with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ eases :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ he@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( diarr@@ he@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ generative diseases may not be used in patients who are possibly hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against am@@ us@@ el@@ or or any of other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase must also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rants ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are equally harmful to the blood and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood .
as in other medicines of HIV , patients suffering from disease ( alter@@ ation in body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( causes of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( symptoms of infection that are caused by a relaxing immune system ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of disease is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of previously treated HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years against risks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r , but the committee set firmly that the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r used to have previously did not use prot@@ eas@@ ex .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; as for the approval of scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to get permission to transport services across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ eases ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children 4 years old .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic boo@@ sters of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ us@@ el@@ r should be taken into consideration of individual viral resistance and pre@@ treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ us@@ el@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable to a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for v@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ Gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules are applied without the ampli@@ fied addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ padding ) , higher doses have to be applied to am@@ v@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines of up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics , efficacy and safety of v@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r or other prot@@ eases were not studied in children .
A@@ generative ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the defect of data to in@@ consist@@ ency and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , adult dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be administered to patients with lighter or even liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ie 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk reduction plasma levels and a di@@ min@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ us@@ el@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generative diseases or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure the HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ Gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of trans@@ ference from HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic he@@ pat@@ itis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combinations , have increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal failure .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of Hepatitis B or C please read the concerned information of this medicine .
patients with existing liver function including chronic @-@ active he@@ pat@@ itis show an increased frequency of liver function problems under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r associated with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ qu@@ anti@@ oids , which should be replaced by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the possible benefits of treating the risk system@@ ic cor@@ r@@ hin@@ oc@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the side effects function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on CY@@ P3@@ A4 , an simultaneous adoption of CY@@ P3@@ A4 is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis not recommended .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods are available for determination of active concentration .
in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma screens ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with am@@ us@@ el@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl gly@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this form@@ ulation of children under a age of four years is contra@@ indicated and should be applied with caution regarding certain other patient groups .
A@@ generic ase should be taken over time 5 if a skin rash occurs from system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , was reported by the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other ill@@ nesses , their therapy drugs needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with pharmac@@ euticals dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with met@@ abolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) , reports were treated with prot@@ eases ( type A and B ) , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous fol@@ ly hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory effect therapy ( ART ) an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory effect on as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ arian eth@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including use of anti @-@ anti@@ bacterial infection , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ opor@@ osis , in particular patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combinations ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates can not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ie 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ GM with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r cannot be combined with drugs , whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to increased plasma ch@@ urch@@ ins with heavy and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in AU@@ C of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and result in resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the harvest@@ ed plasma plate by a dos@@ ing increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects were observed at the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be harvest@@ ed by simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already gets cur@@ rants , the am@@ us@@ eless mirrors and if possible , check the viral load and add the cur@@ rants .
a dos@@ ing adap@@ tion for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ st@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against it by 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
clinical trials were applied to doses of 600 mg of am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily and r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , covering the pot@@ ency and in@@ consist@@ ency of this treatment schem@@ ati@@ as .
52 % reduction if Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ vi@@ r + 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ vi@@ r + 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are achieved twice daily when Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 m@@ g. of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
a dos@@ ing preparation for simultaneous adoption of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to use a tight surveillance , because the efficacy and integrity of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study conducted by A@@ generative ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
for this reason , the gift of esters is required in combination with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustments required .
treatment with pre@@ val@@ ence in combination with am@@ us@@ el@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposition of both prot@@ eas@@ ehem@@ mer would drift .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other proteins and existing limited data can be dis@@ cour@@ aged that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ into could possibly lowers the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ us@@ el@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma plasma .
if these medicines are applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out , as an accurate forecast the effect of the combination of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and ch@@ ok@@ ut@@ in led to a rise in the plasma concentration of 193 % in order to increase the effects of adverse events .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ dd@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase will be advised to reduce the dosage of the recommended dose in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic studies with ar@@ ising in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not carried out but could be increased by both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ ol and 100 mg of m@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to a increase of C@@ max from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day compared to the value that was observed after 200 m@@ g. K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 even if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase may result in inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be monitored in toxic reactions which are combined with these medicines , when they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ eases , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ va , known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of plasma tor@@ ch of am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ odi@@ pine , di@@ stra@@ pin , no@@ str@@ pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ odi@@ pine pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ el@@ avi@@ r , thereby reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous use with ap@@ t@@ ase can increase their plasma cent@@ ric concentrations and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma rose by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of treating a risk of system@@ ic Cor@@ rec@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly influenced by the CY@@ P3@@ A4 , these enh@@ ancements are expected increases by a@@ gener@@ ase .
since Plas@@ massive increases of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or can lead to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended .
it is recommended to increase therapeutic concentrations of therapeutic concentrations as far as stabili@@ zation of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased during the con@@ current gift of am@@ us@@ el@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ Gener@@ ase should not be applied together with oral @-@ taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while during the con@@ current application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advis@@ able .
data for con@@ current use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eases section indicate a possible increase in the plasma pie@@ d@@ geho@@ gs from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to the 3- to 4 @-@ Fa@@ che .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given as the am@@ us@@ av@@ irus dose is to be adjusted when am@@ el@@ avi@@ k is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in con@@ current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies along with a@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional adoption by R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive tiv@@ a is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ il@@ in ) is recommended for con@@ current gift of A@@ generative ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after the weak@@ ening of possible use for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of l@@ act@@ ose rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known to be am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r in the breast milk .
a reproduction study of toler@@ able rats who was administered by the ni@@ fication of the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decrease in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation .
further development of the desc@@ endants including fer@@ til@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r on the parent .
the in@@ consist@@ ency of am@@ v@@ ase was investigated in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects related side effects were slightly up to moder@@ ately pronounced , early on , and led rarely to treatment break@@ age .
in many of these events , it is not resolved if they are used in relation to drug treatment or other medicines to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of inflamm@@ ation .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , which were previously un@@ treated patients 1200 mg of disease twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which have been shown in relation to investig@@ ational medicine as related to study medication , and at more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ ical and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ies of breasts and dor@@ so@@ lic@@ ally fat accum@@ ulation ( l@@ acks ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral rep@@ ented people who had been treated with am@@ us@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine about a medium duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 ( 3 % ) in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin rash were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ul@@ op@@ ap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and compet@@ ed spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without losing the treatment with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combinations ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory effect therapy ( ART ) an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory effect on as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients , which were observed twice daily with low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) , which were achieved among patients who were treated with low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must be observed on signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures .

an@@ tivir@@ al activity in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ us@@ el@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic cells .
the relation between the activity of am@@ el@@ avi@@ an against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined .
non @-@ treated patients with currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as in other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral disease , the 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r received twice a day in the E@@ SS@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , where 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ical could be examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , showed resistance samples that were similar to those with adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 46@@ V , M@@ 46@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 77@@ V , V@@ 77@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of m@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical predi@@ ctions about 96 weeks , the following prot@@ eases @-@ mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations of gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied to ass@@ essing the activity of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r patients with prot@@ eases @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm is defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / C / V , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in connection with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r and a decreased lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of an vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resist@@ ence ) .
the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation samples can be subject to supple@@ mentary data by additional data , and it is recommended to attract current inter@@ pret@@ ations to analyse the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r / ra@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r patients with prot@@ eases @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resist@@ ence against R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ an Resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral disease ( one of which a Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three by 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice @-@ versa Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ eases @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the ob@@ taining of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resist@@ ence mut@@ ations in the ins@@ ul@@ ae .
early departure of a vers@@ ag@@ ious therapy is recommended to keep the accum@@ ulation of a multitude of mut@@ ations in the limits which can affect the subsequent treatment .
the cover of the efficacy of v@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with the lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ cent and thre@@ es@@ core patients ( n = 163 ) patients with recur@@ sive virus sensitivity compared to A@@ Gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis ordered the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r in comparison to the period adjusted ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ Unter@@ le@@ gen@@ icity of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ GM is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was taken for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI was administered at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml during a median increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value .
19 Based on this data should be considered to be the benefit of treatment with PI in treated children of unexpected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; aspir@@ in .
according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against it by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with am@@ us@@ ca@@ vi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the administration of am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dos@@ ing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , minimal concentration in the ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake is influenced the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and lets a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ us@@ el@@ ion in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in total concentration in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r , representing the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State above the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .
therefore , drug , in@@ duce or in@@ hib@@ itions or in@@ hib@@ its , or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 should be given if they are given at the same time ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r is available in the solution 14 % less bi@@ version available as of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable with a milli@@ meter base .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low to the elim@@ ination of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ per@@ avi@@ r plasma organs comparable to a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous adoption of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ o@@ cellular Aden@@ omas and Car@@ cin@@ omas were not yet clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data , both from clinical trials and of therapeutic use , however , there are little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .

these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients have been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
studies on the tox@@ icity of young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in the control as well as with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r animals .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed on a delayed development .
24 If A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ padding ) , higher doses have to be applied to am@@ v@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines of up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be contra@@ indicated in patients with weak or mild liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .

A@@ generic ase should be set at length 27 if a skin rash occurs from system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk for a li@@ pad was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in AU@@ C of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and result in resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against it by 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ vi@@ r + 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are achieved twice daily when Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 m@@ g. of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
a dos@@ ing preparation for simultaneous adoption of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to use a tight surveillance , because the efficacy and integrity of this combination is not known .
treatment with pre@@ val@@ ence in combination with am@@ us@@ el@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposition of both prot@@ eas@@ ehem@@ mer would drift .
if these medicines are applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out , as an accurate forecast the effect of the combination of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ dd@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase will be advised to reduce the dose of dose rates in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .

main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a has also been tested in two studies of 505 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • For the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the results of both studies at bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with a total relief rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is so long for@@ ging , until all the visible f@@ lin@@ ts have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process should be considered to occur when intensive local inflamm@@ atory reactions ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up exam@@ ining 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions could only be cured only , a different therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose was left out , the patient must apply the cream when he noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .

in other studies , in which no daily prescri@@ ption was carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis were observed and a case with an circumc@@ ision was observed .
at an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses there is increased risk of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which resulted in treatment and / or temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions had occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing through a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area needed .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly after the treatment of other k@@ ut@@ to app@@ alled means for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ p@@ ples within the genital and periph@@ eral area , there are no clinical experiences yet .

local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decre@@ ases in general during therapy or reactions , after completing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical result of therapy can be evaluated for approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of the treated skin .
there are currently no data for long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment should be taken in super@@ fi@@ dence bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma other suitable therapeutic forms .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ors .

there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis out of anatom@@ ical positions outside the facial and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on sub@@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this case , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions usually take on intensity or go back to the treatment of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions may cause great dis@@ comfort or very strongly , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
from the data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 A@@ K@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .

minimal system@@ ic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during three times of weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and lived in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour @-@ time period following the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; it points to a pro@@ longed re@@ tention of drug in the skin .
data for systematic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years low and comparable with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fiz@@ zy bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg were significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ itia @-@ weight ; one also showed a similar effects in the mouse over four months .

the study was mainly studied the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( in relation to reducing G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was examined ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me accounted for about 60 % in the urine at the end of the study , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver on the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , rash , arth@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , pain feeling , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions .

the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ me is receiving patients suffering from Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ me to observe the reactions on in@@ fusion and development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to get permission to transport Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed to patients with secured diagnostics of a mu@@ c@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ outlet I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) , in order to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should occur through a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other industrial met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h , if the patient bears this , every 15 minutes in single steps increased to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for those patients no dosage may be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency has not been determined , and for those patients no dosage may be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be monitored @-@ monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in a reasonable clinical environment , which are immediately available for medical emergen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually formed , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop the anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience in the recovery after a longer break , risk of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity must be careful because of the theoretical increased risk of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ r@@ ka ) treat to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion .
in case of a slight or in@@ effective reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction happened .
in case of individual in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion needs to be stopped until the symptoms are to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .

Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or pro@@ c@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of an inter@@ ference with intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
current studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
because no data of new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated towards lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , is recommended to not satisfy while treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not silent .
the adverse events in clinical trials were examined mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug reaction in connection with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase @-@ 3- study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often observed in the following table : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

in most patients it came to a ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version , with a he@@ avier process of injuries to a Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) 13 / 45 patients were not det@@ ectable by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ lan@@ cip@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able anti@@ bodies , among them 3 patients , with which it never had been known to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version .
patients with lack of low anti@@ anti@@ bodies and a robust reduction in the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody tit@@ res was a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal until low @-@ neutral and oral effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ al activity in vitro , which seemed not to affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse drug reactions typically fell along with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies .

after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ ine , the most likely about man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients had been recru@@ ited by the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient demonstrated the difficult phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ c@@ ate exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy was the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute drive test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to improve the lung function in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and a 182 weeks in plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown from the following table .
the decrease in percentage of FE@@ V is not significant over that period of clin@@ ically significant and the absolute lung volume increased rapidly to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a he@@ pat@@ oma prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant waste of the G@@ ag mirror was found in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant at the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gen@@ eous clinical manifest@@ ation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end variable , clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test , movement area of the shoulder @-@ shar@@ ks A@@ hi and visual acu@@ ity ) , was commonly observed in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted primarily to investig@@ ate the security and pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe digest@@ ion form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
four patients increased the dosage due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was found following the Z @-@ Score for this age group the younger patients with severe circulation form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe circulation form only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ si@@ zing schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less strongly affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in a mal@@ ign@@ ant gift , tox@@ icity with repeated gift and re@@ produ@@ ci@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data can not detect specific dangers for humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( a different drug against cancer ) , which is still not toxic to other parts of the body , or spread itself slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , who does not attack@@ ing the cell epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is previously un@@ treated in patients who have previously been treated with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously had previously used other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies as sole therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) and injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 in the treatment of A@@ lim@@ ta .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should be taken before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic drug &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid man@@ gel ) .
in patients whose blood pressure is altered , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be lowered , or the dose may be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer activity duration in cancer cells .
in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study enrolled 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared with 9.3 months in case of filing of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , patients with which the cancer does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , in administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival compared to the compar@@ ative medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to access the traffic of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each drinking bottle has to be processed with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the required dos@@ ing bottle is removed and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma , except for over@@ flowing epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line therapy of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma , except at excessive top , epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion in the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and heav@@ iness of skin reactions on the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ id was given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire duration of therapy and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injec@@ tion vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third payment cycle .
in patients suffering P@@ em@@ et@@ re , a complete blood pattern should be produced before each offering , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a thro@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anin @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dos@@ ing test has to take place under the bri@@ dging of the N@@ adi@@ d of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the forec@@ asted therapy cycles .
according to the recovery , patients must be treated according to tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degrees 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ologic tox@@ icity of 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient must be in front of the treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ tive , a hem@@ at@@ ologic tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continue with the occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or higher compared to patients at the age of 65 , an increased side @-@ effective risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended to use children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ comprehen@@ sibility and efficacy .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments are necessary to go out by the dos@@ ages recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with an at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ant values ( in deviation of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) is not especially studied in studies .
patients need to be monitored in relation to the bone @-@ market soup and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed shall not be given to patients , before the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ en@@ code reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ n@@ osis again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dos@@ ing reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - see paragraph 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and reduction of the degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was noticed if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients need to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ y@@ - l@@ actic measure to the reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ ful ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who have been used for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re is to avoid the intake of N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ loss for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ etic re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients when these events occur , had associated risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ dr@@ ation , existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid flow collection in the trans@@ cellular room , a drainage of the result should be considered before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 severe cardi@@ ovas@@ cular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium in@@ far@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were recorded in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ etic cases , if this substance was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ed vi@@ li@@ ds ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed , men should be referred to in front of the treatment - G@@ inn to get advice regarding blocking .
for patients suffering from normal kidney function ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion lead to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re ex@@ cre@@ tion .
therefore caution is advis@@ able if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid can be used in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - more than 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data on the Inter@@ action potential as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be used for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of physical status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ bodies and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ bodies .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed with pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ fo@@ ols , anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected during pregnancy heavy @-@ birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful reductions of commercial use for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity , men should be referred to in front of the treatment , advice regarding the sperm cells .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into the breast milk and undes@@ ired effects on the inf@@ ant inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients that were treated in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statist@@ ically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) opposite the all@@ some c@@ is@@ pla@@ - T@@ in arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms are caused by improvement of lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control lar@@ m .
a multic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC in patients treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( ITT n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival effect fell to the overall survival of AL@@ IM@@ TA with NSC@@ LC in favour of D@@ ox@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( n = 172 , 6.2 vs. 7.4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separate , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progres@@ sion @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analysis of the P@@ Q Population are consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA c@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .

the most common adverse events depend on the mode of mode of mode , resulting in excess fat that is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after treatment , as you may not have been rig@@ or@@ ously reduced the fat content in the diet .
with the following principles , you can learn to minim@@ ize the nour@@ ishing related compan@@ ions , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fet@@ ish@@ ly nour@@ ishment . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite dishes , and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you will not exceed your fat limit . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not in order to take them in the form of an ob@@ ese main court or a reserved night@@ mare . • Most people with those accompanying you may learn to control them by adjusting your diet .
• Wash the medicine for children un@@ accessible . • You may not apply any more than 25 ° C . • The container ti@@ ghtly closed to protect contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low this in any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transportation box ( shuttle ) that included the package .

overweight has influence on your health and increases risk of emergence of various severe diseases such as : • High blood pressure • diabet@@ ic disease • oste@@ o@@ arthritis - oste@@ o@@ arthritis , with your doctor about your risk for this disease .
a lasting weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more movement , can prevent severe ill@@ nesses , and has a positive influence on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to feed them permanently .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules which you can also find as speci@@ fying in the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum of calories per day .
please refer to the tables below in this section . • The recommended amount of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
which amount for you is suitable , take the below information that is suitable for you , which is suitable for you . • Due to the dominant manner of action , compliance with recommended obes@@ ity is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as so far , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
due to the recommended grease , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and reduce the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood for nour@@ ishing secondary esc@@ ence . • You should try to gradually increase gradually .
34 These reduced cal@@ ory consumption should allow you to lose weight and constantly on weight of approximately 0.5 kg per week , without fru@@ str@@ ations and dis@@ appoint@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you are working on daily or other physical activities . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you walk through movement daily 150 kcal , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
• For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set off realistic cal@@ ori@@ ental and fat content and to ensure that it is useful . • T@@ ry to move more information about cal@@ ori@@ - and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you begin with taking all@@ i .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies which are severe trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of al@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic medication ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because the effects in this age group will not be enough information .
this means that the active ingredient has a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
al@@ xi was examined in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies received , which are severe and excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are severe trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron .
when a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission announced Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting at highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer illness and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer illness .
the effectiveness of al@@ xi in prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , induc@@ ed by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on po@@ ass@@ age , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub @-@ acute i@@ le@@ us after injection is monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able with the con@@ current gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or tend to extend such an extension .
in connection with another chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics gift , al@@ xi in the days after chemotherapy shall neither be used to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibit against tum@@ ors of the five investigated chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic interaction between one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis it has been shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , o@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , o@@ ox@@ et@@ avi@@ an , o@@ ox@@ et@@ avi@@ an , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) did not have a significant impact on Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences about the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied during pregnancy , unless necessary , it is considered necessary by the doctor treating them .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to follow @-@ up side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reaction ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar instr@@ ument@@ ations of unwanted events as in the other do@@ si@@ veness groups were observed ; there were no dose @-@ action relationships .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind@@ ness studies were received in total 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time study 7.3 hours ) , which was given at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ simil@@ ven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who were 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were intra@@ ven@@ ously at day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
clinical trials for chemotherapy induc@@ ed nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were comparable to the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron owns the ability to block the iter@@ ations of vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation , and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted by 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of I.@@ V. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration follows a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average elim@@ ination of the body with an average terminal time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration camp ( C@@ max ) and the area at concentr@@ ating @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dos@@ ages of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average total of 11 spo@@ ol@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patient was measured between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increase of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations that , at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days , overall exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved a value compared to one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher for one @-@ time value of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys and are converted by another 50 % , which are converted into two primary metals , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less dimensions , the is@@ ocy@@ tes CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination of an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found around 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active ingredient was about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ ting injection was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination time is increased and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate about the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which suggests a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ onic channels , which can be involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure during humans ) , which resulted daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver cancer , endo@@ kr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ es ( thy@@ roid , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , non @-@ mice ) .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high doses used , and Alo@@ xi is determined by people for one @-@ time use , relev@@ ance of these results are low as low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of this approval for transport must inform the European Commission on the transfer of the medicine within the framework of this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ itarian agents ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative expertise in which the application for the treatment of he@@ pat@@ itis C intended drug is recommended for the treatment of he@@ pat@@ itis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is similar to an organic drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicine that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference agent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) he@@ pat@@ itis C ( one caused by a viral infection caused by virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue has damages , and the values of the liver , Al@@ an@@ in amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought into the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on demonstrated that the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( compound structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy of he@@ pat@@ itis C ) .
in the study on patients with he@@ pat@@ itis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on with efficacy of the reference therapy was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , how many patients were diagnosed after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , concerns were wor@@ sen@@ ed that data on the stability of the substance and the non @-@ market@@ able drug is not sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of patients with he@@ pat@@ itis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease has fl@@ ared up to more patients than in the reference agent ; also Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from that , the test was used in the study to examine how far the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Imp@@ et@@ igo ( a her@@ etic skin infection ) and small in@@ surg@@ ents ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ pped ) , de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation and se@@ wn w@@ ounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go has not worked against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface should not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient doesn &apos;t respond to treatment two to three days , the physician should try again investig@@ ate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was de@@ pressed after the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke on the treatment .
in the treatment of infected les@@ ions , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in found similar response : when the results of both studies have been taken together with skin burns , about 90 % of both groups were random@@ ised to treatment .
in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was detected in the treatment of ab@@ ro@@ o@@ ds ( vanity cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been demonstr@@ ably or presumably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is irrit@@ ation at the Princip@@ al .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go has out@@ weigh the risks of the following superf@@ icial skin infections : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , • infected small in@@ la@@ er@@ ations , de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation or se@@ wn w@@ ounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who have no improvements within two to three days should be examined once again and an alternative therapy is considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sen@@ si@@ bil@@ isation or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled , the oint@@ ment carefully wi@@ pe off and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a path@@ ogen ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical studies in clinical studies were the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment does not include any improvement or deteri@@ oration of infected job .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 In the con@@ current oral gift of 2 times a day , 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low @-@ system exposure of top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ age adap@@ tions are not required if top@@ ographic Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ produ@@ ci@@ icity after surgery and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and f@@ atal@@ ities / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic anti@@ biot@@ ic .
in deci@@ ding to see if the breast@@ feeding is continued , or the therapy should continue with Al@@ tar@@ go , the benefit of the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go for the woman should be weak@@ ened .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go was the most common adverse events in the meeting , which concerned about 1 % of patients .
mode of mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated from fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a specific binding office of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acts anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding office of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bind@@ ings and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ center .
by bind@@ ings on this binding point of in@@ hibit P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transportation , block partially P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent normal education active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler under@@ units .
should be due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resist@@ ence the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , should consult a consultation by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
in a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was placed daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on int@@ act and on be@@ amed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary w@@ ounds , individual plasma samples were gained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in case of medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last use .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording of the people after top@@ ical use of 1 % oint@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ors .
Met@@ abol@@ ism In vitro oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily associated with CY@@ P3@@ A4 , less than low shar@@ ehol@@ ding of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

after applying the oint@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a gaz@@ eb@@ ox , unless your doctor did not fall to cover the area .
it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic clasp , which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of oint@@ ment , or in an aluminium bag that contains 0.5 g sal@@ be .
Ambi@@ rix is used to protect Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) with children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of an existing vaccine plan , whereby protection against he@@ pat@@ itis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of he@@ pat@@ itis B infection , and ensured that it is able to end two doses of existing vacc@@ ines .
if a recording dose is undes@@ ired against he@@ pat@@ itis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another he@@ pat@@ itis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can defend against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system identi@@ fies viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and creates anti@@ bodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix includes the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adult since 1996 and approved the vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same diseases , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one of three doses of existing vacc@@ ines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults have identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between both injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of anti@@ bodies against he@@ pat@@ itis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the Ambi@@ rix protection rating is similar in a six @-@ month distance between injec@@ tions .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite , pain on injection , red@@ ness , mat@@ ness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be sensitive to patients who might react to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ biot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a approval for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ mer mun@@ eration with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collection is requested for he@@ pat@@ itis A and he@@ pat@@ itis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combined with a combination sim@@ p .
the anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis C virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis C virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not totally secured whether immune competent individuals who have addressed to a he@@ pat@@ itis A@@ - vacc@@ ination has also been protected as protection , as they are also protected by immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injec@@ tion@@ ist ingredients for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate capabilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against he@@ pat@@ itis B is required , the standard scheme is recommended to combine the 360 EL@@ ISA units forming he@@ pat@@ itis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ b@@ ance of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody is achieved , so in these cases , the gift of further vacc@@ ination can be required .
as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ ordin@@ arily imp@@ air@@ ment , these injection paths should be avoided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected , however , as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered at a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was administered to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ def@@ effects , possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this form@@ ulation , the incidence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ri@@ age , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fever is comparable with the frequency , which was observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ - and pre@@ servative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses of combination sim@@ ulations .
only exceptions were the higher number of pain and matches on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses @-@ combinations .
according to the entire vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects that Ambi@@ rix had given to receive pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 dose of combination sim@@ p .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ness was similar ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ cycle of 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects , the Ambi@@ rix were given , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination sim@@ p ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ness was low and comparable that after filing the combination sim@@ pl@@ ine was observed with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurr@@ ence of local reactions and gener@@ ational reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group is comparable to the 3 @-@ doses of combined he@@ pat@@ itis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , during the 6- to 11 years , the Ambi@@ rix was reported to have a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not pro pro@@ band .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines , which reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated he@@ pat@@ itis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B cells , was statist@@ ically not different .
in clinical trials , which were carried out in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the rati@@ os rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the rati@@ os rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were obtained from the standard combined standard with three doses .
the 289 persons whose imm@@ unity was worth@@ less ( SP in the table below ) was significantly higher against he@@ pat@@ itis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ fuel than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were reached in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds within a month after finishing the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA units of in@@ active he@@ pat@@ itis C virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B @-@ surface an@@ tigen .
people who were at the time of pri@@ mer mun@@ eration was between 12 and 15 years old , the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ anti@@ bodies could be proven at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination process .
the immune response against both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens that was form@@ ulated after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination sim@@ ulated he@@ pat@@ itis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant he@@ pat@@ itis B @-@ surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
a clinical study at 12@@ - up to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody is comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life using a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ul@@ atory per@@ t@@ uss@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ king m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 cans of current form@@ ulation in adults was shown for the present form@@ ulation similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ echn@@ ics and ser@@ oc@@ on@@ oid rates as for earlier form@@ ulation .
the vaccine is based on both human particles and / or physical visible changes after the res@@ us@@ ement .

the he@@ pat@@ itis C virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ us@@ cious food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as bathing in water pollution .
you can feel very tired , having a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may need to be a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with he@@ pat@@ itis C or he@@ pat@@ itis B virus even if the full vacc@@ ines has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected with Hepatitis B or he@@ pat@@ itis B virus already , if you are infected with he@@ pat@@ itis C or he@@ pat@@ itis B virus ( although you feel / your child does not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) it may not prevent vacc@@ ination .
protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms resulting from he@@ pat@@ itis C or he@@ pat@@ itis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ biot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can be turned through it@@ ching skin rash , breathing not , or sw@@ elling of the face or the tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against he@@ pat@@ itis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a heavy infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against he@@ pat@@ itis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to usually the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
with a possible risk of infection with he@@ pat@@ itis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the physician will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined he@@ pat@@ itis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective he@@ pat@@ itis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined he@@ pat@@ itis B virus ( chronic he@@ pat@@ itis B ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced salary of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination before completion of the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is badly damaged in people who are suffering from skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened on a disorder or treatment in your body &apos;s body , or if you / your child is subject to a ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons may not be enough , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Be your doctor if you / your child will take other medicines ( including those that you may receive no prescri@@ ption ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated with no prescri@@ ption , or if you have been given off / her child , or Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibody ) have been given , or that is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both he@@ pat@@ itis A and B viruses .
when another vaccine must be given at Ambi@@ rix at the same time , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and different limbs .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or after an injection of Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ inen , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix is not given pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women unless it is urgent to be vacc@@ inated with he@@ pat@@ itis A and he@@ pat@@ itis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ biot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very frequent ( more than 1 case per 10 doses ) : • pain or complaints during set @-@ in or red@@ ness • Mat@@ ching • head@@ ache • appet@@ ite
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 doses ) : • sw@@ elling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ ness • gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal complaints
further side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with compar@@ ative combination or individual vacc@@ ines against he@@ pat@@ itis A and he@@ pat@@ itis B were rarely reported ( less than 1 case per 10.000 ver@@ im@@ planted cans ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on data , which has become known since the division of the first approval for the course , the CH@@ MP has been positive that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remain positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was transferred only to a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) in traffic , the available security data for this medicine may be limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ph@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentration ) in the pre@@ history .
fo@@ aps - split up to several boxes of meals - carved , mixed under the food , or through a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ ome ( through the stomach ceiling ) or a r@@ end@@ onde ( by the nose into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , because ammon@@ ium is not compared to another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a p@@ seudo @-@ drug , i.e. without the active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also lead to appet@@ ite loss , s@@ alty acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ium is effectively prevented in patients with mal@@ functions of urea with high ammon@@ ium values .
ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; as due to the condition of the disease only limited information about this drug .
the use of all patients is inde@@ xed in all patients , where a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ ers have already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of Life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( in@@ complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ defective , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) , there is a indication of the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low up tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually by taking the protein tolerance , and for the growth and development of the patient &apos;s necessary daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adults and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate , or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ ce bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an in@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ ype need to receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0,4 @-@ 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ low disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets do not arrive immediately into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ i@@ ver heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with sodium re@@ tention and dem@@ ni@@ otic clinical states only with caution .
because Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate on the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the meaning of this results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk , and this is due to the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS while the lac@@ tation is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) to and at 78 % of these unwanted events were assumed that they were not related to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old ano@@ re@@ tic patient which developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ ac@@ ia , he@@ avier hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ or neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which showed an dos@@ ing of up to 400 mg / kg / day for a dos@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is an met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed active connection made by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
phen@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results .
previously , the progn@@ osis of the earliest form of the disease with the occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ra , and the disease carried himself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids and their st@@ ick@@ ener free anal@@ oga within the first year of life to death .
due to ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis , the use of an alternative way of nitrogen analysis ( So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated cal@@ orie and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase the survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first half @-@ month ) ill@@ nesses of 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in this patient the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients with many for mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ let deficiency ) , which were treated from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible for treatment and some patients may occur further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its Met@@ abol@@ ite in plasma and urine were determined according to an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate with so@@ vereign healthy adults and patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , and with rep@@ aid of oral doses ranging from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablets were found 15 minutes after intake meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with urea @-@ cycli@@ c disorders ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fast@@ enings no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate in the plasma was ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , were five times higher than after the first gifts on the third day .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat was treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children who do not swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or about a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ ome or a r@@ ens@@ onde .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adults and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins should be held within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate , or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ ce bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ f@@ ö@@ ds were exposed in front of the Birth of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ t ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid &apos;s cells of the brain channel .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old ano@@ re@@ tic patient which developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ ac@@ ia , he@@ avier hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ or neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
in fact , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess

angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( heart attack ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dit@@ in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - up@@ lift &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value at electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
In@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who use a PCI is administered by a higher dose and in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow and enhance the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS at all@@ some gift , or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another an@@ tic@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI compared .
during the PCI the patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ( to prevent a closure ) , and they received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of new events ( death cases , cardi@@ ac disease or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment .
in patients suffering from a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as Hep@@ arin , except with heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who are possibly hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or one of other components .
it may also not be used in patients who had a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ovas@@ cular problems .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is a replacement for Hep@@ arin &apos;s treatment in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd with approval of In@@ ver@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in an emergency case or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is performed in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
according to existing PCI requirements , the reduced output dose of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of them directly connected intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
security and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us gift by An@@ gi@@ ox is not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to less than 225 seconds , a second screw @-@ of @-@ weight should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constit@@ uted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before use and the bolt dose rapidly administered intra@@ ven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is not required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is treated with a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg can be used and the ACT 5 minutes once again is used .
in patients with severe kidney damage , which led to the approval phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Bol@@ us without Dos@@ age to average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated for 30 minutes after the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of un@@ question@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous CER@@ s of low molecular Hep@@ arin .
• well @-@ known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active substance or any other ingredient or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased bacter@@ ium disease . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another an@@ ode ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ad , most bleeding occurs at an arter@@ ial points of points , in patients who occur in per@@ k@@ ut@@ onic cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during treatment in principle everywhere .
in patients who are taken care of goods and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) should ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine was achieved once again in front of the treatment .
starting from the knowledge of anti@@ fung@@ al stimul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ant ) , these active substances can increase blood risk .
in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ders or an@@ ode stimul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters can be used regularly in any case .
the experimental studies are in@@ adequate in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding , or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

the following data on side effects are based on data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal Group as well as in the patients treated with Hep@@ arin , it was more common in women as well as patients over 65 years of common events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding came in significantly less than in the comparison group under Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after complete application in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organic categories in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is to be removed immediately and the patient eng@@ ul@@ ously monitor the patient with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific thet@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ ous , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is tied in the liquid phase or at straight .

in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine was induc@@ ed by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with ser@@ um of patients , in which it was in the past to he@@ ared Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ ed Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was induc@@ ed .
in patients with healthy volunteers and patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine shows a dos@@ ing and concentration dependent effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out in the patient a PCI was given an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ question@@ ed Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was administered according to relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) or in PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk agents , which required an angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardi@@ ovas@@ cular biom@@ ar@@ ker , 28 % had diabetes , and about 99 % of all patients had been subjected to angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who need a treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra becomes sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected or inj@@ ected as a permanent fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to measure the glu@@ cose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin is not effective .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in distingu@@ ishes very slightly from human@@ ize , and the change means that it affects faster and shorter activity duration than a short @-@ effective human@@ ization .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two trials with a total of 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , when the body insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the change in the substance gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ li@@ ded hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.14 % to insulin p@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who are possibly hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be customized if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect the glu@@ cose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is either a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal wall .
due to the reduced Glu@@ kon@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the di@@ min@@ ished insulin delivery , the insulin need for patients with a restri@@ ction of the liver function can be reduced .
any change of action , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin dose ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc del@@ ays etc . ) , the type of insulin delivery ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulin delivery .
3 An in@@ sufficient dosage or demol@@ ition of treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ulated type of diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabet@@ ic caus@@ ation ; these conditions are potentially threat@@ ening .
conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin delivery should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage .
the time of saving a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia depends on the insulin profile of the insulin delivery profile and can therefore be changed when switching the treatment schem@@ es .
the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the inc@@ lin@@ ation to hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ sis ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , fibro@@ us , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine @-@ oxid@@ ase ( Mao ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide anti@@ biotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics like beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin , the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ders should be weak@@ ened or missing .
an experimental studies on re@@ productions showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ on@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ ins exceeds the human breast milk , but in general insulin is not consumed in breast milk , nor is res@@ or@@ ated according to oral application .

severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ sis with consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is treated by a doctor accordingly , or by intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glu@@ cose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ cose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the documents for the severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating periph@@ eral glu@@ cose ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin delivery faster and the activity duration is shorter than hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - T@@ US showed insulin @-@ glu@@ ing in the therapeutic met@@ ering area of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , a dose of proportional glu@@ cose consumption , precisely like human insulin .
insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double @-@ fast mode of action as normal human@@ ize and achieves the complete glu@@ cose effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
data from the data was clearly indicated that in an application of insulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al glyc@@ emic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal .
when insulin was harvest@@ ed in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was given as with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ ins is turned in 15 minutes after the meal , a comparable glyc@@ emic control as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see figure 1 ) , is reached .
insulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in with a gift of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the meal before the meal was given ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin delivery within a gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ th@@ - mal@@ nutrition , which was given 2 minutes before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
