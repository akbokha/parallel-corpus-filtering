<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirl thinking and speech, hallucinations (listening or seeing of things that are not present), misstrust and insulations; • Bipolar-I disorder, alternating with periods of normal episodes) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat medium to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of gested unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral ingestion is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both illnesses can be used to take the solution or the melt tray for patients with hatching of tablets difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time, the dose of abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs signal transmission between" "" "neurotransmitter" "", "i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripigezol is probably mainly called "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripigezol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and Dopamine, but in smaller size than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder plays a role to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychological or manic symptoms and reoccur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify that reoccur symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to increased unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and Placebo was compared to 160 patients, with whom the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disturbance, which suffered from gested unrest (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies by investigating how the body absorbs the melting tray and the solution for inclusion (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger punishing symptoms of unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying bipolar disorder treatment in four of five short-term clinical symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the reoccur manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses have also been more effective than placebo the symptoms of unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (unchecked), vomiting, nausea (dizziness), vomiting, Nausea (dizziness), vomiting, nausea (increased memory production), tiredness and exhaustion, orestlessness, insomnia (sleeping disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Committee on Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of abilify in treating schizophrenia and in the prevention of a new manic episode of patients who were mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were on the treatment with Aripigezol." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased disturbance and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes, if an oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of equal to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at an allowance of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness at dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripient dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also with Aripigezol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased suicidal risk associated with Aripiprazol in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripigezol should be treated with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardium infarction), cerebrovascular diseases, terms of hypotony drugs (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure-absorbing drugs) or hypertension (including acczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that a year or less digested, there were occasional reports during the treatment with Aripiprazol appearing.</seg>
<seg id="39">When patients encountered with ABILIFY the patients of signs and symptoms of late dynasty occur, should be weakened to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has developed signs and symptoms that have penetrated a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="41">For example, Aripigezol was to be used in the anamnese in the Anamnese or at random, which are related with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old, with Aripient in patients with psychosis were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for unwanted zerrovascular events with Aripigezol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases, associated with Ketoazitin or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who have been treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally known in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar managers, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as side effect is known and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Because of the primary effects of Aripigezol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripigezol is used in combination with alcohol or other central medicines such as seals (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers an effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased by 107%, while Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects, and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolisier can result the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripigezol in comparison to CYP2D6 extensible metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should weigh out the potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteases, should have similar effects, and therefore, similar dosing reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose height before beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be given together with a moderate increase in the arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methodxymorphine-ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients would be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripigezol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "due to the insufficient data to safety during the animal, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit does clearly justify the potential risk for the fetus." ""</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as in other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned, hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, to use until they are certain that Aripiprabenzene has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) as under placebo or were classified as possible medical-relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study about 52 weeks, treated with Aripigezol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dynasty were treated compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was under Aripigezol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients who were treated with Aripient, and 15,1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manian episodes at bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was treated for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo with which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of the Cpk (creatine monosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripigezol treated, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which can occur in connection with a antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptical syndrome, late dyskinesis and campfanosis, unwanted zerrovascular events, and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate overdose can be observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death row.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hematalysis in treating an overdose with Aripigezol; it is unlikely that hematalysis is in treating an overdose of use because Aripiprazol has a high plasma integration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripigezol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder through the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripigezol showed high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenders and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg. a day more than 2 weeks in healthy volunteers showed a dossier reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligations, at the Nucleus caudatus and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprabenzene showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In one week 52 the share of the patients in Haloperidol consulted that a response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measured values defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-asberg- depression rates showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34% in the Aripient group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia was about 26 weeks, the 314 patients involved a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg when an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a more flexible dose of 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a rather than placebo superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprabenzene showed no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazol found a substantial effect compared to placebo by lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week, Aripiprazol released a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on like Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar or valor-monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirror, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol released a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with Lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, Aripiprabenzene showed a remission in front of placebo with regard to prevention of a bipolar return, primarily in the prevention of a remission in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyulation is catalyzes by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination time of approximately 75 hours for Aripient with extensible Metabolisers about CYP2D6 and at nearly 146 hours at "bad" (= "Poor") of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">There are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic analysis of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A popup-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics found no indication of clinically significant differences regarding the ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney insufficiency in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose-study of subjects with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripigezol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to pull loops on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity, and toxicity potential, the preclinical data have no particular dangers to the human being.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans. they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects include a dosed-dependent side-dependent side toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or Parenchantric-State exposure (AUC) at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the average maximum dosage of 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the middle Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">Moreover, a cholelixasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugations of the hydroxyde metabolism (1 to 3times of the average Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations in the human Galle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at concentrations of the sulfate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study above 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that resulted in Expositions of the 3- and 11fold of the medium Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="300">Orestlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reaction is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no causal link established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubular drug, which promotes the relocation of microtubules from the tube-indices and stabilizes the microtubules through inhibition of their deportolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilisation leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubulary network that is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the transzytosis of plasma cutting into endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies proved that the presence of Albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transidothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminreceptor in cysteine in cysteine), a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is assisted by data of 106 patients in two innumerable unversioned studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer with Abraxane treated, which was given an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>

<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for lowering Baseline on the basis of cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total-paclitaxel after 30 and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active carbon exposure (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration took place in multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has an expansive extravascular distribution and / or incline binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared after intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane compared to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg. / m2 A solvent containing a 3-hour injection of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane gift (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue histories is reported that Paclitaxel is metabolized in first line to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller Metabolite (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel) metabolized (3" -p-hydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane was the mean value for cumulative loss of urea with less than 1% of the given total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which points to an extensive non-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been incorporated into the formation of epitetine fa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to an injection in a Vene as part of a main study with 479 patients who were caused by kidney problems, compared with reference agent.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients at this study had been injected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a Vene before they were either converted to seamed or still received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Main Indicator for the efficacy was the change of hemoglobinary values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">Moreover, the company also laid the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin speckled Abseamed were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo for 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobinds of patients were converted to seamed, in the same measure as in those patients who still received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who remained Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a increase of blood pressure that sometimes lead to symptom of a encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, migracial headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed should not be used in patients who may possibly be excessive (allergic) against eretine alfa or any of other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, because further studies are necessary to ensure that there are no allergic reactions.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration at 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration of time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by Cytochrome P450-Enzymsystems is unlikely, because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized because it is not a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, non-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinine Clearance, and in the 64 evaluated patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (clutr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function to down to a creatinine clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustments of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), which is discussed, as the Committee for Humanitarian Aid (CHMP) will be discussed in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) for patients (especially overweight patients), where metformin (a diabetic medication) can not be applied. • It can be applied along with another diabetic medication (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which can not be dissatisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylharnstoff or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyl harnum or insulin can be maintained, except for patients with hypoglykemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulfonyl harnemia should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's body can be improved better and the blood sugar level decreases, which makes type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients, the activity of Actos in Tripletherapy was studied; in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl harp, in addition they received either Actos or Placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glyphylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured as well as the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value which allows blood sugar levels to be reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional gift from Actos showed an existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl harp in a lowering of the HbA1c-values by 0.94% while the additional gift of placebo was 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients was examined, the patients who received Actos in addition to insulin took a decrease of HbA1c-values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disorders, infections of the upper respiratory infections (cold), weight gain and hypoesthesia (diminished sensitivity).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can neither be used in patients suffering from Pioglitazone or any of the other components, or in patients suffering from liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic causation (high blood levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin patients when Metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission announced the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to transfer Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and bear on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient (see section 4.4) due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose variable.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or economists, especially those with reduced cardialer reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on the signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and odeficiency, when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports about heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm) or with other signs of liver illness, Pioglitazon must not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT mirrors are raised up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver cells are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms develop, which point to a hepatoma dysfunction, such as unsolved nausea, vomiting, torment pain, fatigue, appetite and / or darker Harn, are the liver cells.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazon should be continued, should be directed to the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies of Pioglitazon, a dosed-dependent weight gain was found, which can stir in fat deposits and in some cases linked to the liquid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a haembrandy under the therapy with Pioglitazon (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemogloins by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin intensity in patients with Pioglitazone or triple-combination therapy with a sulfa drugs or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing dependent hypoglykemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">According to the market launch, Thiacolidindione, including Pioglitazon, has reported a occurrence or a deterioration of a diabetic macular agent with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of maculaödemen, but obordnating doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular hole; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone marches from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated Fraktur was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 questionnaires per 100 patient years with women who have been treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazone in patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractions per 100 patient years) with patients that were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or happens, the treatment is due (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for study interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with pharmaceuticals, which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, Cyclosporine, calcium blocker and HMGCoA-reducers are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC of Pioglitazon by the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a lowering of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the treatment of hyperinsulemia and increased insulin resistence in the pregnancy and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 10; sometimes &gt; 1 / 10; sometimes &gt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">They lead to a temporary change of the tower and refractive index of the lens, as well as other hypoglytic compounds.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents came across as far as placebo, but less common than in comparison-groups under metformin or sulfonyl harnics.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with existing macrovascular disease the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon or under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch, rarely has been reported about heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients suffering from cardiac insufficiency in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone marches from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of current proactive study, fractures were treated with Pioglitazon patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) with patients that were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">For taking the most reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have a activation of specific kernel receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator), which leads in the animal model to an elevated insulin intensity of liver, fat and skeletal musculine cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces gluing production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Glicular Act as monotherapy has been continued for two years, in order to investigate the period of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was diagnosed with pioglitazone in 69% of patients treated with Glicular (50% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was disconnected with insulin, was randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who still only received insulin; an reduction in the insulin-treated patients treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies of a year under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decline in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotients have a statistically significant decline compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined at a type 2 diabetes in a small one in 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo was a reduction in the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the entire plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to the placebo under Pioglitazon, no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel was observed, while under metformin and glicular nub values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced triglyceride, but improved also the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this also improved through a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as on the triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting macrocular disease in groups were randomized to have existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either under Pioglitazon or Placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application Pioglitazon is resorted quickly, with the peak concentrations of unaltered Pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV equivalent to the efficacy of the efficacy of Pioglitazon, whereas relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) increases and lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marked Pioglitazon, the marker was found mainly in the thread (55%) and a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination time of unaltered Pioglitazon amounts to 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolism is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The sections of Pioglitazon and its Metabolites are similar to patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearing of the parent's substance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys are coincided with repetitive plasmac enlargement, anaemia, and reversible concentration of hypertrophies.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the treatment of hyperinsulemia and increased insulin resistence in the gestation and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of familiarious polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidindian resulted in an increased frequency of colontum.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated Fraktur was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 questionnaires per 100 patient years with women who have been treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazone in patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractions per 100 patient years) with patients that were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclader were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decline in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotients have a statistically significant decline compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced triglyceride levels, but improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, both above a effect on the Tryglyzerid absorption as well as on the hepatitis tryglizzerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target of its primary endpoints, a combination of the total mortal, non-kill coronartic syndrome, leg amputation above the Knuckle, Coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, suggest the results close to taking Pioglitazon no cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is unable to use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study was measured after 12 weeks concentration of a substance (glyphylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror that hints the blood sugar levels quite strongly like with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may cause hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, doses of Actraphane may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar (the full list is to take place).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane has outweigh the risks of diabetes against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission announced the company Novo Nordisk A / S approval for the transport of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection pin must be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar may significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy, the hypoglykemia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast wirling, bipolar, long wirling insulin, etc.), type of insulin (insulin delivery) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA towards insulin origin) can cause a change of dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the switch to Actraphane is required during the patient, it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglysis reactions after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning of a hypoglykemia reported less or differently than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travel, which should go over several time zones, the patient should be referred to as the advice of his doctor, as such journeys can result, insulin and meals must be taken or taken during other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">Therefore, the physician must consider potential interactions in therapy and should always ask for his patients to be questioned by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4. both hypoglykemia is also hyperglycemia, which occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglysis can lead to consciousness and / or clave cases and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Gelegally - Periphere Neuropathy a rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are regarded as acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. however, the insulin therapy with a abrupt improvement of blood sugar may be connected with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Illnesses of the skin and the undertaking tissue has been developed by Lipodystrophy at an injection point, if failed to switch the deposits within the injection system.</seg>
<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints in the administration place Gelegally - Local hypersensitivity reaction to the injection site (redness, swelling, itching, itching, pain and hematoma in the injection site) occur.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Gelegaccio - Urtikaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions of generalised hypersensitivity, itching, gastrointestinal disorders, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, a hypoglycemia can be gradually developed: • Easy Hypoglysis can be treated by oral sugars or sugar intake.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugar fruit juice with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection lock (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or by glucose that is intravenously given by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the activity maximum will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the whole time of activity is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorptionprofile is based that it is a mixture of insulin-products with faster or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of directives (hydrolysis) locations on the Humaninsuline molecule were drawn into considerations; none of the Metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity, for carcinogenic potential and for reproduciicity, the preclinical data can not detect specific dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane pass is taken from the fridge - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not more than 25 ° C) is taken before it is used according to the manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglysis reactions after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning of a hypoglykemia reported less or differently than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">Therefore, the physician must consider potential interactions in therapy and should always ask for his patients to be questioned by them.</seg>
<seg id="895">12. both hypoglykemia is also hyperglycemia, which occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="896">13. however, an increase of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement of blood sugar may be connected with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function exerts no influence on the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can be assumed that a dosing adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum increment, a calculation of the creatinine and a monitoring of urinary tract) is recommended.</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent controls on the Tacrolimus valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled by Prograf, dosing, dosing adjustments, changes to immunoslimus whole blood circulation system, which may be controlled (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advance is a medicine with a low Clearance, adapting the dose may need several days until the steady State occurred.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advanced is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a blood circulation disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application apply to whether advocate for the treatment of bleeding or preventive hemorrhage is used in surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency, causing blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles, or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been incorporated into the formation of the human concentration camp VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advanced is similar to another in the European Union called recombinate, similar, but it contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with heavy up to moderate Hämophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was investigated for preventive hemorrhage as well as surgical intervention.</seg>

<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advices (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexie (fever), and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances may not be used in patients who may possibly be excessive (allergic) against the human concentration factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG approval for the transport of advances in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitutionary therapy are addressed according to the severity of the factor VIII-Manage, according to the place and degree of bleeding and the clinical condition of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1542">At the following comrhorrhagic events the factor VIII activity is not to drop under the specified plasma (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute problems are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment it is used to control the dose of administered dose and frequency of injections found a reasonable determination of factor VIII-Plasmapiedgehogs.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo Recovery and have different half times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis to the long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmaze can not be reached, or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out if necessary to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be addressed according to the patient, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against procoagulatory activity of factor VIII in IgG Immungratuline that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">In order to develop the risk of inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk depends on the first 20 exposition days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In case of previously treated patients (PTPs) with over 100 expositions and anamnetable well-known inhibitors, it was observed after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the reappearance of (lowest) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare upheaval of hemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs's largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), who have previously untreated patients with previously untreated patients who have higher risk of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data protection available, CHMP has also been rated positively as a positive rating, but in consideration the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of safety profile of ADVATE, which requires a filing of PSURs every 6 months, the authorisation has to apply for another renewal application in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited officially distributed to the Committee on Humanitarian agents (CHMP) that the company receives his application for the transport of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">However, the breast, the brain, bone or female organs (fabric that combines other structures in the body, surrounds and relies on) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that was genetically modified that it can carry a gene in the body cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">With the virus in Advexin, it is a "Adenovirus," that has been so modified that it cannot produce any copies of itself, thus unable to extract infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have to be injected directly into the tumours and so that the cancer cells are supposed to restore normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein which is formed from non-defective in the human body is normally formed to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells, if DNA can't be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-cancer, with which the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company collected data from a study with a patient who joined Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of undermining, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP has tested the answers to the questions presented to him, still some questions were unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the evaluation of the initial submitted documents the CHMP in day 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni Tumors has not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of drug in the body, the type of administration, as well as safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not adequately proven that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for people nor for people who come in contact with patients who is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company won't be aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently has clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen-inflammatory inflammation) in patients with nose loops (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents 12 years of age, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is one tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be mounted on the blockage of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">Most effective measures were the changes of the severity of the hypocrisp symptoms which were reported by the patients at the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours a journal, and defended with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all hypocrusupfylsymptoms except the blockage of the nose reported the patients, the Aerinaze's income, compared with a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in the patients who suffers Pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was examined, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relieving of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients suffering the desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachycarder (heart chase), harmonic acid, dizziness, mental pain, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (somnia), somnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be susceptible to patients who may possibly excessive (allergic) against desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against adrenerous agents or loratadin (another drug to treat allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinol can also not be used in patients suffering from hypertension (hypertension), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroose (hypertension) or hypertension (hypertension) caused a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a hemorrhage) or having a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe company approval for the transport of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet may be taken with a glass of water, however, is to swallow in full (i.e. without them to break, break, or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the fault of the defect and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible, and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term application can take the activity of pseudoephedrine at time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After lowering the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory, treatment with desloratadine can be continued as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients suffering from a monoaminoxidase (Mao) inhibitor within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity with other vasoconstrians such as Bromocripitin, Pergolid, otergoline, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other decongestiva, the peroral or nasal as abovellous rhinocopamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetacolin, Naphazard, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collection and are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for dosing.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data do not suffice to address appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or of palpitations, heart rhythmia, nausea or etaigen other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a reinforcement of headaches) must be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In case of treatment of the following patient groups, patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension (patients with hypertension) patients with hypertension in the anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder, substructure or bronchospasm in the Anamnese patients.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours prior to performing such matological testing, because Antihistamika otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or to reduce its extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In addition, clinical trials with desloratadin, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were also administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or change of the plasma concentration of desloratadin was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor tests were no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">"" "" "" "the enzyme has not been identified by the metabolism of desloratadin responsible enzymes that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded." ""</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconsistency of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictor properties of pseudoephedrine should not be applied in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified in this fact that it may occur in very rare cases that lead to impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-Depression (seal, apnea, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, heart circulation collation) and a CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, Treat, Konvulsions) with possible letteries.</seg>

<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human Mastcells / Basophila as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adjusionate P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In an individual dose-study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no influence on standard measuring sizes, including the amplifying subjectivity, or the tasks that are related to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine at recommended dosage may cause further sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachycarder or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1.248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, taking 414 patients aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the total cores for the symptomatic (except nose loops), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2 week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nose loops, was significantly higher than a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2 week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in relation to gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Within a single dose-study of the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is demonstrable within 30 minutes after receiving the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow balance of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was investigated in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (among them four studies of seasonal rhinitis and two trials in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of paddling, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) and after six weeks treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution for insertion and the melt tray in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">Allergy culitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decline of symptoms (symptom points) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies of Urtikaria the decrease of the symptom was after six weeks treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius should not be used in patients who may possibly be excessive (allergic) against desloratadin, loratadin or one of other components.</seg>

<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with a or without a meal, to relieving symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials on the effectiveness of desloratadine with young people aged from 12 to 17 years (see section 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be terminated according to the preceding clinical symptoms and can be resumed after repeating the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to treat patients during everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions performed in clinical trials with desloratadin tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were also administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the current usage of alcohol and alcohol was not reinforced by alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified however that it may occur in very rare cases that lead to impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported in patients with Aerius recommended dose of 5 mg daily, than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events described above the more common than in placebo was fatigue (1,2%), mouthdries (0.6%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">A clinical study with 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years ago was the most common side effect of headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadin, and with 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine months clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibiting of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human Mastcells / Basophila as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion of the adhesion of endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Within a clinical study with multiple doses, in the desloratadine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study found in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In single dosing study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes, including the amplifying subjectivity, or the tasks that are related to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, Nasensecretion and itching of the nose, itching and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As indicated by the total cores of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-Stingitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was examined, as the underlying pathophysiology, since the underlying pathophysiology, is unaware of the ethtiology in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily prospectively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a causative factor in all of the chronic idiopathic diseases, Desloratadin is also expected in other forms of the Urtikaria to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in enhancing Pruritus, and the number of paddles at the end of the first dose of dose.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamine, were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in patients treated with Desloratadin patients in comparison to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wax significantly, as was measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal rhinitis population, 4% of patients showed a greater concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no evidence for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily use of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme has not yet been identified for metabolism of desloratadin responsible enzymes that interactions with other medicines not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited nor a substrate's inhibitor of P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single doscope with desloratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low-calorie breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin, at a comparative degree of exposure of desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity of the Desloratadin and by Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity, and for reproduciicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin can't recognise any special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colorless film (includes lactose Monohydrate, Hypromless, Titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, blew wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius may be taken independently of the meals, for relieving symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhinitis is caused by infection in children under 2 years (see section 4.4) and that no data are in the treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnese, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolized desloratadin constrained and experienced a higher substitution (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, the restricted metabolized, is identical to those with children that metabolized metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients should not take patients suffering from fructose intolerance, glucose-lactose-absorption or a sucrose-isomaltor insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions performed in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were also administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, alcohol is not amplified when taking Aerius tablets and alcohol reaction influence effects of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported in patients with Aerius recommended, than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In an multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, during which up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine months clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the age of 1 and 11, who came to a question for antihistamine therapy, received a daily desloratadindosis of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2,5 mg. (ages 6-11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children can be similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin can be extrapolated in adults.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Within a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine, in a dose of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study on adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold the clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc-intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies suggested dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1779">A single daily dose of 7.5 mg conducted by Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impairment of the psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies on adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol is neither a amplification of the alcohol induced performance attaching to an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adults and youthful patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, Nasensecretion and itching of the nose, itching and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As indicated by the total cores of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-Stingitis, Aerius tablets decreased effectively the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in enhancing Pruritus, and the number of paddles at the end of the first dose of dose.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The dissemination of this restricted metabolic phenotyps was similar in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasia (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syupformulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which is restricted metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) caused by desloratadin was about 3 to 6 hours higher and the Cmax approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half time of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant active ingredient cumulation after once daily application of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>

<seg id="1911">Agenerase was examined in combination with other antiviral drugs, but in two main studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with protease.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This is compared with low dosified Ritonvir reinforced drug vase was compared with 206 adults, previously compared with other proteases.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main Indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentration of HIV in the blood (viral load) or change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously been taken no proteases formerly did not have had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>

<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of vase in combination with low doses of Ritonvir or other proteases were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerative ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the defect of data to inconsistency and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, adult dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be administered to patients with lighter or even liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzie 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk reduction plasma levels and a diminished therapeutic effect of amuselr (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Agenerative diseases or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to cure the HIV infection, and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with AGenerase does not prevent the risk of transference from HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>

<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly influenced by the CYP3A4, these enhancements are expected increases by agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmassive increases of this HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor can lead to myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended to increase therapeutic concentrations of therapeutic concentrations as far as stabilization of cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased during the concurrent gift of amuselr (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1993">Data for concurrent use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteases section indicate a possible increase in the plasma piedgehogs from Midazolam to the 3- to 4-Fache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Ameliavir, the patients should therefore be monitored at opiatric symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given as the amusavirus dose is to be adjusted when amelavik is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In concurrent gift of warfarin or other oral antibodies along with agenerase, an increased control of INR (International normalised ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional adoption by Ritonvir on hormonal contraceptive tiva is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods are recommended for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and nortrypilin) is recommended for concurrent gift of Agenerative ase (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and their extension APV30005 (700 mg of mamprenavir / 100 mg ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) in patients with virological failure occurred in patients with virological predictions about 96 weeks, the following proteases-mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic interpretations of genotypic interpretations systems can be applied to assessing the activity of amelavir / Ritonvir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir patients with proteases-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm is defined as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10I + 147A / C / V, I84V and L90M in connection with Ritonvir and a decreased likelihood of an virological response (resistence).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation samples can be subject to supplementary data by additional data, and it is recommended to attract current interpretations to analyse the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance testing, phenotypic interpretations systems can be used in combination with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of amelavir / raitonvir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir patients with proteases-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests, have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV which can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Ritonvir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistence against Ritonvir, the sensitivity against Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance of amperavir and other proteasants for all 4 Fosamprenavian Resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>

<seg id="2035">The cover of the efficacy of vase in combination with Ritonvir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI pre-treated adults (standard of care, SOC) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, primarily with the lowest Ritonvir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescent and threescore patients (n = 163) patients with recursive virus sensitivity compared to AGenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis ordered the non-superiority of APV / Ritonvir in comparison to the period adjusted (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-Unterlegenicity of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the effectiveness of unbundled AGM is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was taken for intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosified Ritonvir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI was administered at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included in the study included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml during a median increase of the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered to be the benefit of treatment with PI in treated children of unexpected benefit of "unbundled" aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ameliavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax against it by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with amuscavir (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amaviavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amaviavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, minimal concentration in the steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake is influenced the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and lets a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amuselion in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in total concentration in plasma, with the amount of unbound amaviavir, representing the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amaviavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during the total drug concentration in the Steady State above the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drug, induce or inhibitions or inhibits, or a substrate of CYP3A4 should be given if they are given at the same time (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amaviavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amniavir is available in the solution 14% less biversion available as of the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable with a millimeter base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonvir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low to the elimination of amelavir and raitonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This treatment schemata lead to amperavir plasma organs comparable to a dose of 1200 mg of amaviavir twice daily without simultaneous adoption of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies with amusability of mice and rats, with male animals benigne hepatocellular Adenome at doses of doings (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg Ameliavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hepatocellular Adenomas and Carcinomas were not yet clarified and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data, both from clinical trials and of therapeutic use, however, there are little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxic tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), microcore testing of rats and chromosomenaberrationest on human peripheral lymphocytes, was ameless nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously no significant liver toxicity in patients have been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity of young animals, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality in the control as well as with amelavir animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition which was significantly below (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed on a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If AGenerase capsules are applied without the amplified addition of Ritonavir (Boopadding), higher doses have to be applied to amvase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amaviavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines of up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amaviavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should be contraindicated in patients with weak or mild liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly studied the safety of the drug, but it was also measured by its effectiveness (in relation to reducing Gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was examined).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme accounted for about 60% in the urine at the end of the study, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver on the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Alduracyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), pain feeling, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), Tachycarder (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Alduracyme may not be excessive hypersensitive to patients (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be announced every year all new information that may possibly be known to update and update this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Alduracme is receiving patients suffering from Alduracme to observe the reactions on infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. to get permission to transport Alduracme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a combinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovstock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Alduracyme is indexed to patients with secured diagnostics of a mucysaccharioutlet I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency), in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Alduracyme should occur through a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other industrial metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h, if the patient bears this, every 15 minutes in single steps increased to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for those patients no dosage may be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of alduracme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency has not been determined, and for those patients no dosage may be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Alduracme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be monitored-monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be available in a reasonable clinical environment, which are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG antibodies against laronidase are usually formed, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop the antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution (see section 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience in the recovery after a longer break, risk of hypersensitivity must be careful because of the theoretical increased risk of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with drugs (antihistamine and / or antipyrka) treat to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or ineffective reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction in the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate when the reaction happened.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of individual infusion-related reaction, the infusion needs to be stopped until the symptoms are to decline, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion is able to reduce infusion in 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred to be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate that occurred at the previous reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Alduracyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain, because there is a potential risk of an interference with intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Current studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Because no data of newborns, which were exponated towards laronidase over the breast milk, is recommended to not satisfy while treatment with Aldurazyme is not silent.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were examined mainly as infusion-related reactions which were observed at 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug reaction in connection with Alduracyme, which were observed during phase-3- study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are often observed in the following table: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with heavy MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory and lungs in history, severe reactions, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during an Phase- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with mostly severe digestion and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a seroconversion within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconversion, with a heavier process of injuries to a Serokonversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature departure from the study) 13 / 45 patients were not detectable by Radioimmunoplancipation (RIP) Assay demonstrable antibodies, among them 3 patients, with which it never had been known to Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antiantibodies and a robust reduction in the Gag mirror in Harn, while in patients with high antibody titres was a variable reduction of Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal until low-neutral and oral effect on the enzymatic Laronidal activity in vitro, which seemed not to affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically fell along with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning for the enceptive Therapy is in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulate substrates and the preventing of another accumulation sufficient restoration of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysine, the most likely about manose-6 phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of alduracyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients had been recruited by the mean phenotype and only one patient demonstrated the difficult phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcate expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy was the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute drive test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received another 3,5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to improve the lung function in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and a 182 weeks in placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in percentage of FEV is not significant over that period of clinically significant and the absolute lung volume increased rapidly to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatoma prior to treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant waste of the Gag mirror was found in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinine), which remained constant at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous clinical manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined end variable, clinically significant changes in the 6-minute walk-test, movement area of the shoulder-sharks Ahi and visual acuity), was commonly observed in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old open phase 2 study was conducted primarily to investigate the security and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were under 5 years old (16 patients with severe digestion form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">Four patients increased the dosage due to increased GAG- mirror in the Harn in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was found following the Z-Score for this age group the younger patients with severe circulation form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with severe circulation form only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemata were carried out on the Gag mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions, but is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dossizing schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less strongly affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is previously untreated in patients who have previously been treated with Cisplatin and in patients who previously had previously used other chemotherapies as sole therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should receive a Corticosteroid as well as folic acid (vitamin) and injections of vitamin B12 in the treatment of Alimta.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with Cisplatin, should be taken before or after the gift of Cisplatin in addition an "antiemetic drug" (drug against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent liquid mangel).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pressure is altered, or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be lowered, or the dose may be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed in its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer activity duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In a main study of 456 patients, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>

<seg id="2381">According to the recovery, patients must be treated according to tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematologic toxicity of 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient must be in front of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dose-reductive, a hematologic toxicity or non-hematologic toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- continue with the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or higher compared to patients at the age of 65, an increased side-effective risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended to use children under the age of 18 due to non-sufficient data to incomprehensibility and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a creatinine Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments are necessary to go out by the dosages recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with an atinine Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper limit value and / or transaminant values (in deviation of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) is not especially studied in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored in relation to the bone-market soup and Pemetrexed shall not be given to patients, before the absolute Neutrophencode reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thrombo- cynosis again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dosing reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute Neutrophilately, Thrombozytense and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - see paragraph 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and reduction of the degrees 3 / 4 hematological toxicity as neutropenie, febrile neutropenie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenie was noticed if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed patients need to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophy- lactic measure to the reduction-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney insufficiency (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mindful (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who have been used for therapy with pemetre is to avoid the intake of NSAIDs with long half-loss for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetic remixed (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of alxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic medication).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because the effects in this age group will not be enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient has a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Alxi was examined in three main studies on 1 842 adults, chemotherapies received, which are severe and excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, which are severe trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were treated in 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were treated in 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron.</seg>
<seg id="2615">When a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission announced Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the transport of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting at highly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer illness and prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy because of cancer illness.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of alxi in prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding a corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonosetron can extend the colon poassage, patients with anamnesty Obstipation or signs of a sub-acute ileus after injection is monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable with the concurrent gift of Palonosetron with drugs that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or tend to extend such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with another chemotherapeutics gift, alxi in the days after chemotherapy shall neither be used to prevent nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron inhibit against tumors of the five investigated chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinic interaction between one-time intravenous dose palonosetron and a steady concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis it has been shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Amiodarone, ooxetubicin, ooxetavian, ooxetavian, Sertralin and Terbinafin) did not have a significant impact on Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences about the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied during pregnancy, unless necessary, it is considered necessary by the doctor treating them.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to follow-up side effects (a total of 633 patients), at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reaction (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar instrumentations of unwanted events as in the other dosiveness groups were observed; there were no dose-action relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably no effective therapy with a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blindness studies were received in total 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of dansetron (half-time study 7.3 hours), which was given at day 1 without dexamethassimilvenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients who were 32 mg Ondansetron, which were intravenously at day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Clinical trials for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were comparable to the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the clinical studies, Palonosetron owns the ability to block the iterations of ventricular De- and Repolarisation, and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted by 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG-effects of I.V. administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows a slow elimination of the body with an average elimination of the body with an average terminal time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration camp (Cmax) and the area at concentrating-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the entire dosages of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average total of 11 spoolcarcinoma patient was measured between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increase of Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations that, at once daily intravenous administration of 0,25 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days, overall exposure (AUC0- ∞) achieved a value compared to one-time intravenous administration of 0,75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher for one-time value of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys and are converted by another 50%, which are converted into two primary metals, compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in less dimensions, the isocytes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found around 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered active ingredient was about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single-time intravenous bolting injection was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function, the terminale elimination time is increased and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction of dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate about the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which suggests a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of pre-clinical studies indicate that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionic channels, which can be involved in ventricular De- and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure during humans), which resulted daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver cancer, endokrine neoplases (thyroid, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, non-mice).</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but because of the high doses used, and Aloxi is determined by people for one-time use, relevance of these results are low as low.</seg>

<seg id="2676">If the patient doesn't respond to treatment two to three days, the physician should try again investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosoms (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main Indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was depressed after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected lesions, Altargo and Cefalexin found similar response: when the results of both studies have been taken together with skin burns, about 90% of both groups were randomised to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, that Altargo was detected in the treatment of abroods (vanity cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been demonstrably or presumably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is irritation at the Principal.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo has outweigh the risks of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small inlaerations, depreciation or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the transport of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvements within two to three days should be examined once again and an alternative therapy is considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensibilisation or severe local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is canceled, the ointment carefully wipe off and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical studies in clinical studies were the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections that were caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2- or 3-day treatment does not include any improvement or deterioration of infected job.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 In the concurrent oral gift of 2 times a day, 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the middle Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on the diced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low-system exposure of topical application in patients, Dosage adaptions are not required if topographic Retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduciicity after surgery and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fatalities / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding to see if the breastfeeding is continued, or the therapy should continue with Altargo, the benefit of the infant and the benefit of the Altargo for the woman should be weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo was the most common adverse events in the meeting, which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a specific binding office of the bacterial Ribosoms, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interacts antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding office of ribosomales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-bindings and the Peptidyltransferasecenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By bindings on this binding point of inhibit Pleuromutiline the peptidyltransportation, block partially P-binding interactions and prevent normal education active 50s ribosomaler underunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be due to the local prevalence of resistence the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms, should consult a consultation by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-appealing to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was placed daily under occlusion on intact and on beamed skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamulin Salbe received twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary wounds, individual plasma samples were gained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in case of medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last use.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording of the people after topical use of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism In vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomites was primarily associated with CYP3A4, less than low shareholding of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test, respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-microcore testing in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B (diseases which affect the liver) with children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of an existing vaccine plan, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, and ensured that it is able to end two doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a recording dose is undesired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A- or -B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by bringing the immune system (the natural defense of the body), as it can defend against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system identifies viruses and surface antigens than "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix includes the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix adult since 1996 and approved the vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same diseases, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of one of three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults have identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indebator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between both injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the Ambirix protection rating is similar in a six-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetite, pain on injection, redness, matness (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be sensitive to patients who might react to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a approval for the transport of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for primer muneration with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection is requested for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combined with a combination simp.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not totally secured whether immune competent individuals who have addressed to a hepatitis A- vaccination has also been protected as protection, as they are also protected by immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injectionist ingredients for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, appropriate capabilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard scheme is recommended to combine the 360 ELISA units forming hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and persons with disturbance of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibody is achieved, so in these cases, the gift of further vaccination can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a subordinarily impairment, these injection paths should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombozytopenie or blood clots, Ambirix may be injected, however, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered at a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphthie-, Tetanus- and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was administered to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosusive therapy or in patients with immundefeffects, possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matriage, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever is comparable with the frequency, which was observed in the previous Thiomer- and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses of combination simulations.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher number of pain and matches on a calculation basis per vaccination Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects, compared with 39.1% of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-doses-combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the entire vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects that Ambirix had given to receive pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3 dose of combination simp.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matness was similar (i.e. over the entire vacccycle of 39.6% of subjects, the Ambirix were given, compared with 36.2% of subjects who received the 3-doses combination simp).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and matness was low and comparable that after filing the combination simpline was observed with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and generational reactions in the Ambirixgroup is comparable to the 3-doses of combined hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, during the 6- to 11 years, the Ambirix was reported to have a common occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not pro proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines, which reported about severe side effects during the 2-cans vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B cells, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were carried out in vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the ratios rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The ratios rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to and including 15-year-olds, 142 two cans of Ambirix and 147 were obtained from the standard combined standard with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The 289 persons whose immunity was worthless (SP in the table below) was significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3-dose-fuel than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were reached in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds within a month after finishing the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-doses of vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units of inactive hepatitis C virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B-surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">People who were at the time of primer muneration was between 12 and 15 years old, the Persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibodies could be proven at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination process.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response against both antigens was comparable to both antigens that was formulated after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination simulated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">A clinical study at 12- up to and including 15-year-olds could be shown that the Persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibody is comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was given in the second year of life using a combined diphthie-, Tetanus-, acellulatory pertussus influenza vaccine, or with the first dose of a combined masking mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 cans of current formulation in adults was shown for the present formulation similar seroprotechnics and seroconoid rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is based on both human particles and / or physical visible changes after the resusement.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, having a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may need to be a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus even if the full vaccines has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus already, if you are infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus (although you feel / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel) it may not prevent vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms resulting from hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection, cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be turned through itching skin rash, breathing not, or swelling of the face or the tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / your child has a heavy infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to usually the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the physician will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective hepatitis C virus and 10 micrograms of a combined hepatitis B virus (chronic hepatitis B).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with reduced salary of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination before completion of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is badly damaged in people who are suffering from skin and not in the muscle. • If you are weakened on a disorder or treatment in your body's body, or if you / your child is subject to a haemalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons may not be enough, so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Be your doctor if you / your child will take other medicines (including those that you may receive no prescription) or if you have been vaccinated with no prescription, or if you have been given off / her child, or Immunglobulins (antibody) have been given, or that is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">When another vaccine must be given at Ambirix at the same time, should be vaccinated in separate places and different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be given at the same time or after an injection of Immunglobulinen, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Normally, Ambirix is not given pregnant or lactating women unless it is urgent to be vaccinated with hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on data, which has become known since the division of the first approval for the course, the CHMP has been positive that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remain positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was transferred only to a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003) in traffic, the available security data for this medicine may be limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete Enzymphopathy (brain damage due to high ammonium concentration) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Foaps - split up to several boxes of meals - carved, mixed under the food, or through a gastrostomiesome (through the stomach ceiling) or a rendonde (by the nose into the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because ammonium is not compared to another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without the active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also lead to appetite loss, salty acid content in blood, depression, irritability, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonium is effectively prevented in patients with malfunctions of urea with high ammonium values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium was approved under "extraordinary circumstances" as due to the condition of the disease only limited information about this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use of all patients is indexed in all patients, where a complete enzymers have already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of Life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzymdefective, which manifests itself after the first life of life), there is a indication of the use when in the Anamnese is a hyperammonite Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow up tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually by taking the protein tolerance, and for the growth and development of the patient's necessary daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adults and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate, or ornithintranscarce bamylase, the substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an inininosuccinatype need to receive arginine in a dosage of 0,4-0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallow disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulzera, if the tablets do not arrive immediately into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestiver heart failure or severe kidney insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and demniotic clinical states only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because Metabolization and excretion of sodium phenylbutyate on the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The meaning of this results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neurons and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found whether phenylacate is excreted in the breast milk, and this is due to the use of AMMONAPS while the lactation is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) to and at 78% of these unwanted events were assumed that they were not related to AMMONAPS.</seg>

<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred at a 5 month old toddler with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed an dosing of up to 400 mg / kg / day for a dosing neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacate is an metabolized active connection made by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenchiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phenylbutyate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">Previously, the prognosis of the earliest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infra, and the disease carried himself in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids and their stickener free analoga within the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to haemalysis, the use of an alternative way of nitrogen analysis (Sodium phenylbutyate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacate), proteinated calorie and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase the survival rate in postpartal (however within the first half-month) illnesses of 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in this patient the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients with many for mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotes form of the Ornithintranscarlet deficiency), which were treated from a hyperammonium encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a proteinated diet was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment and some patients may occur further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its Metabolite in plasma and urine were determined according to an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate with sovereign healthy adults and patients with liver cirrhosis, and with repaid of oral doses ranging from oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate in tablets were found 15 minutes after intake measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>

<seg id="2849">According to results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat was treated with toxic and non-toxic effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either oral (infants and children who do not swallow any tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or about a gastrostomiesome or a rensonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adults and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate, or ornithintranscarce bamylase, the substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anoretic patient which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactacia, heavier hypokalemia, armor neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">In fact, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on examinations on the analysis of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle, the sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment, and in some patients may occur another deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate in granulatform were found 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply), for example in unstable angina (heart attack) or myocarditinfarction (heart attack) without "ST- uplift" (an anomal measuring value at electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Ingiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who use a PCI is administered by a higher dose and infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with angina or heart failure to maintain blood flow and enhance the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS at allsome gift, or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIA inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticulant) and a GPI compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patients often have a stent (a short tubes that remains in the arteries to prevent a closure (to prevent a closure), and they received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in the alleviation of new events (death cases, cardiac disease or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients suffering from a PCI, angiox was as effective as Heparin, except with heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudine, other Hirudine or one of other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who had a hemorrhage, as well as people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is a replacement for Heparin's treatment in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission announced the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd with approval of Inverox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndrome (instabile angina / non- ST-Hebungsinfarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency case or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is performed in a further sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75 mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to existing PCI requirements, the reduced output dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an intravenous bolt of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and one of them directly connected intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Security and effectiveness of a single Bolus gift by Angiox is not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened (ACT after 5 minutes) to less than 225 seconds, a second screw-of-weight should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before use and the bolt dose rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is not required, provided the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is treated with a PCI (whether with Bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg can be used and the ACT 5 minutes once again is used.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with severe kidney damage, which led to the approval phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which led to the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of Bivalirudin Bolus without Dosage to average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated for 30 minutes after the intravenous gift of unquestionated Heparin or 8 hours after the termination of the subcutaneous CERs of low molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• well-known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any other ingredient or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased bacterium disease. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anode ulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in PCI-patients under Bivalirudad, most bleeding occurs at an arterial points of points, in patients who occur in perkutonic coronarintervention (PCI), during treatment in principle everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taken care of goods and treated with Bivalirudine, a monitoring of the INR-Werts (International normalised ratio) should ensure that the value of treatment with Bivalirudine was achieved once again in front of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of antifungal stimulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozytenant), these active substances can increase blood risk.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of Bivalirudine with thrombozytenders or anode stimulants, the clinical and biological hemostatic parameters can be used regularly in any case.</seg>

<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after complete application in practice and are grouped according to system organic categories in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose the treatment with Bivalirudine is to be removed immediately and the patient engulously monitor the patient with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thetrombinous, which binds both at the catalytic center of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is tied in the liquid phase or at straight.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of Bivalirudin at Thrombin, and thus its effect is reversible because Thrombin declining the bond of Bivalirudin Arg3-Pro4 slowly, eliminating the function of the active center of thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudine was induced by Bivalirudine with serum of patients, in which it was in the past to heared Thrombozytopenie / heparininduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) was induced.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In patients with healthy volunteers and patients, Bivalirudine shows a dosing and concentration dependent effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out in the patient a PCI was given an additional bolt of 0,5mg / kg of Bivalirudin and the infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>

<seg id="2977">Apidra is either a subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, to apply or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Glukoneogenesis capacity and the diminished insulin delivery, the insulin need for patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of action, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin dose (normal, NPH, zinc delays etc.), the type of insulin delivery (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or demolition of treatment, especially in patients with an insulated type of diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic causation; these conditions are potentially threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin delivery should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of saving a hypoglykemia depends on the insulin profile of the insulin delivery profile and can therefore be changed when switching the treatment schemes.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the inclination to hypoglysis (ACE) inhibitors, fibrous, fluoxetine, monoamine-oxidase (Mao) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathatholytics like beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin, the symptoms of adrenders should be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">An experimental studies on reproductions showed no differences between insu- lingonulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin pulisins exceeds the human breast milk, but in general insulin is not consumed in breast milk, nor is resorated according to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed in clinical trials known according to system operations (very common: ≥ 1 / 10; often: ≥ 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10;</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - silent, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed, the injection site within the injection range is continuously changing, can occur in the result of a lippodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglysis with consciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is treated by a doctor accordingly, or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the documents for the severe hypoglykemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin delivery faster and the activity duration is shorter than hu- manem normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- TUS showed insulin-gluing in the therapeutic metering area of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, a dose of proportional glucose consumption, precisely like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-ulisin has a double-fast mode of action as normal humanize and achieves the complete glucose effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Data from the data was clearly indicated that in an application of insulin pulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postprandial glycemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">When insulin was harvested in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranal control was given as with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin pulisins is turned in 15 minutes after the meal, a comparable glycemic control as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- grooves before the meal (see figure 1), is reached.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin pulisin with a gift of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal before the meal was given (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery within a gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN: afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human north- malnutrition, which was given 2 minutes before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
