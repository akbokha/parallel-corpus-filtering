to load these modules in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings gallery .... Open the map card tools and choose the required modules .
this is a list of standard settings from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that if you have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package .
in order to use the crash module , click &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; if there is a crash , or the list of stor@@ my cases , if available , delete .
the module view filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras view . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory on different ways .
in order to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : document@@ ations , all other no@@ des are under@@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various tool@@ bar and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the special feature of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists in it , sh@@ allow file @-@ map graph@@ ically with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is proportional to its size . this size must have the size of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it . according to this way , large files can be easily detected , if they are far recognized in the file format . according to that , it can be considered a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap shows a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simpli@@ fy navigation , the right rec@@ tan@@ gles and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over color mode can be either deep for the easy detection of sh@@ utter @-@ depth or the illustration of another file pec@@ uli@@ ar as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify if there is enough space to display , or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles may occur . in addition , you can define the relative position of the lettering in the rect@@ angle .
for Settings algorithm for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this goal is not always available . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is square .
as the allocation of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will be left . here it is possible for marking and avo@@ iding space losses through frame always beneficial to the spaces that are as possible . the best methods for this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can set the minimal displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , a R@@ aut@@ en@@ ID is drawn into the area of an or@@ derly entry , in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an or@@ derly entry .

&amp; digi@@ plug ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also a free , further increasing number of cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to computers and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use serial port for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . as photos in general large files are slow and transm@@ is@@ sions over the serial port are slow . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports this cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that EX@@ IF assistance can not be read from some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be able to change anything else , or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ plug ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( Hand@@ book ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ al ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules of all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also manipul@@ ate a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ plug ; by writing a small module to complement a function when changes in &amp; digi@@ plug ; even perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode using F@@ 11 and C@@ trl + Shift + F .
pulling and lay off images everywhere : you can place a picture in a different part of the tree @-@ tree , via the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be used in keywords , list or search .
- a file selection allows you to highlight the common areas : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields indicated in the symbol view . this is how the fil@@ tering on the fil@@ ename is only displayed if this ind is indicated also . which fields are displayed in the dialog box settings .

&amp; digi@@ plug ; character@@ izes each picture by a long number with a special technology , the hair algorithm . this allows you to compare these Sign@@ atures . the inferior to the difference between two image sign@@ atures , each more they match . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture . by means of a sw@@ elling can be enlarged or resi@@ zed . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the un@@ precise search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
Sk@@ etch : open @-@ hand sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and digi@@ plug ; finds the matching pictures . here , a sw@@ elling can be set .
this rider uses an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature program . press C@@ trl ; put button in button to draw a square . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is , of course , which contains your pictures of Ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the bottom below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; introduces a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image data formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add the light table in the context menu . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window , you can open the light table with L Extras .
from the thumb@@ nail , you can drag the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and place there . if you can preview synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar , then you will find them with the other image , then you can compare the same range of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to extract quickly out of a picture series . if you use p@@ airing from the tool@@ bar , then use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in your left side . the right next picture will be displayed in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies through a number of similar images .
of course the normal del@@ etion works directly from the light table like F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each range , you will find a built @-@ in swivel function you can click on the crossed parts of the picture , you need to click on the visible area of the picture . in the mode preview the same images will then show the same image range .
zoom is just as in other views . simply use the zoom kno@@ b under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in into the picture and beyond . this happens in both images when you are in a preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos decre@@ ases , sc@@ anned or digital photos saves a form of digital stock management . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we will give you a tool , find a plan and practical tips how to secure your photos , use , protect and convert photos . we will focus on the method for digital photograph@@ ers , backup , ass@@ ure , ass@@ ure , ass@@ ure , evaluate , archive , and export and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes on , inde@@ xed , categor@@ ized , searches , transformed , cont@@ empl@@ ated and exported contents that have a mon@@ et@@ ty or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is defined according to your definition data , information about or documentation other data , which are managed by application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you &apos;ll certainly not know how many photos you have , then you &apos;ll certainly use a certain picture as well as in the image files to store very fast searching and a secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
first you do and know what to do in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos may have to save or put them on a stored drive , or if you have to switch them to a larger drive , you must have to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your memory location . if you &apos;re ready to organize your date , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . and then you will publish a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements like , ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , working processes , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % unemployment files have , and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes forkli@@ fts easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies the backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the metadata in the metadata page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget , then you can select the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? this puts &amp; digi@@ p@@ act , an metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now start the real work , since you should select all photo keywords , labels and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that you want the same attribute . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos .
let us now use key@@ codes , keywords , like to use other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catal@@ og@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ plug ; the tree for you will build the images to the right place . the um@@ sor@@ ption of the hier@@ archy in the tree is no problem and can easily be performed by pulling a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keyword will be followed by &amp; digi@@ al ; updates the lower trees .
the graphic shows like different metadata . this is a very rough representation because each block of metadata is composed of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catal@@ og@@ ate your metadata .
they want to let most ni@@ em@@ ate your photos simply view , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to arrive like your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , people , space .
and now I say to you this the lan@@ de@@ position of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing is . Wow ! it is beginning to dream , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence , so your perception has been completely changed .
for others the title is probably more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show images you should tell us a story . remember , the key is to help you to understand Him about the motif that she has moved to understand what you understand .
it &apos;s fine when a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength to work only with a label for himself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can export a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can even export it to a selection of pictures at the same time . if you export your pictures into web @-@ galleries , then you will have to tell you the name of the web @-@ gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you will have to tell you the story for opening a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train leaves the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization can be disp@@ ens@@ itive and will be deeper into the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also download the photos at the reception . you can also export the photos at the reception . you can also export photos to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word match with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to remove any limitations regarding the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the work .
the following description tells you what information is stored in the setting page of &amp; digi@@ plug ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for cre@@ ators and author ) : this field should not include your name , or the name of the person that has been created . if it is not desired , the name of the photographer can be saved , then it should not be changed once again . this field does not support Com@@ ma nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work title of photograph@@ ers . examples may be as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mem@@ o to the author field , it must be filled in .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working as a message agency like Reuters or Associated Press , then you can see the picture here . if the picture is a bearing picture , then the group / agency offers the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright laws , although this does not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator . for individuals , this problem is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique . &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the near future , there will be such a module for forkli@@ ft processing .
topics : record error , disk fail@@ ures , power stations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ag@@ eing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , deser@@ tification , vit@@ re@@ ty , temperature , data size , widespread aber@@ ration
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that went on the road or a fire . this type of losses are the same that you may also have traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s biggest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics what reasons have a data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , this c@@ auti@@ ous needs to be treated more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that will claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your measuring space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you are good Dis@@ ks and good recording sessions , and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write much reliable . it is about to choose the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for mistakes , even if you &apos;ve just been written for the form@@ att@@ ing and the control environment . despite this massive protection they are needed for form@@ att@@ ing and the control environment . despite this massive protection they use it through chemical ag@@ eing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster to appear on CDs and DVDs . it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged floppy disks , drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks appear to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store up to 50 GB , making it almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything about CDs and DVDs has been also applied to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recorder to store and check the media with a description , date &amp; author identi@@ fier and afterwards stored in a clean , dark dry and on animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
floppy disks retain their statistics for themselves . your branch profiles include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a big field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives .
shortly : dis@@ ks keep the error in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in case of lower temper@@ ament , error rates are increased dramatically . some of SM@@ ART may not determine the error . some of SM@@ ART are the most likely failure . this is especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and Verlag@@ s@@ rator . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before switching the files , but these losses can normally be made without any major problems .
while most electric devices do not work much , it looks different with devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious loss of keys , entire data loss , hardware age , destruc@@ tive motherboard and other defects . protect yourself from avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against ra@@ tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device absor@@ bs and the rest er@@ det . however , it is normally found in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that not every plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protect against hot flash@@ backs and thus protects the proper devices connected .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should also check that all peri@@ pher@@ als which can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide transfers for your modem . others also offer an telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV map .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and they also contain the protection for the modem . thus , they are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be meaningful in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection from over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically keep battery power when charging the system . some models allow them to work out until the stream again . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure that they get the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the provided software is interesting .
remember potential risk , which is exposed to your computer system and compare your security while preventing this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be purchased for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you &apos;re using it . at the end , you should always think of all cables to tr@@ enne before you arrive in your holiday .
Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data .
compared to the hard drives too , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . beyond that , you need to send data about compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions therefore occur only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) , and Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online memory services that are sp@@ aci@@ alized on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB , and you will not provide you in full resolution online , in case of Flickr dramatically . for $ 25 per year you will receive unlimited memory , which should only be checked in reality .
from the view@@ point of data security , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted and the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributor memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are pr@@ one to transfer errors . the file system fs and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that you cannot tell you when it happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces occurred . it is fairly distur@@ bing that there is no protection for it . no one seems to have thought in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer dat@@ ory than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transfers , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ esystem , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes a year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems appears to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with squ@@ ads and can be highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon as well as for Windows and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for &amp; Linux . it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data losses related to not@@ ebook and 46 % at the work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage than such as theft or modification . and there is currently only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulner@@ able for data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if however , a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics to all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteri@@ or@@ ized for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or greater formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive is currently available for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not have any data loss for data loss . so , make sure your data often have been affected by a data loss . secure your data in any problem like the re@@ installation of your operating system , replacing boards or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a flash , you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster fails locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget planes , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data dangerous enough . they usually affect a whole space or a complete house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ pre@@ ventive always means no local storage . bring your f@@ use up the stairs to the neighbor@@ ing house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above , a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and provides a complete copy at a time .
securing : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup period . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last f@@ use . creates the original status at any time . this backup is made in order to restore such a backup . this backup is only un@@ locked and not continuously running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script controlled ft@@ p sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase your security via ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer at a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . every other th@@ inning should be done manually , after which you have made a complete check .
topics : metadata , file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ ev@@ ing images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , usage of the Internet .
so valuable images will survive the next 40 years that you are really interested in you because they are really interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noticed :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you have to look at careful and re@@ assess during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way forward as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should have used yourself as the current system backward , the easier is to rate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by declar@@ ations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that for reading your pictures is important , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your calcul@@ ator architecture , your memory and f@@ uses technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the table print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
let &apos;s go from which you have plan@@ ed the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and copy the to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new disk was detected by the system but do not hang it up .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC # source , the new record is / dev / S@@ DC and dollar ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; re@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier for year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PNG was used as an open source standard which should replace GIF . it can save as much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , but not as many as TIFF , but not as many as TIFF has needed and a slow compression . this format will we recommend you to store your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as a picture format . it manages images in high quality , but needs very large files . with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format . however , there is more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a free @-@ free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is now based on the need for the camera to use metadata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; the file information is allowed with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive the metadata separately from the video file , and as it can be noted above the file format . therefore , you should remember whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organisation supporting a wide range of application purposes and business models . to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI @-@ Communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fied efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera plate , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your shell archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a sensitive processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut in under circumstances of the other programs .
protect the mach@@ ined images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it then in Web@@ gal@@ ery , add to MPEG , you can use in contact , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section add photos to an album you can already add photos that you already have already on your hard disk , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album tank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the computer , turn on the camera on the ad mode , and switch them on . another description will be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a remote indicator appears at the lower end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos are displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file extension refers to any file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information about each entry . with the lateral features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an entry or metadata .
this dialog shows fil@@ tering characteristics and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . please note that some digital cameras do not have any information available .
the tab Metad@@ ata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer re@@ mark , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the met@@ a @-@ side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug . note that these metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera into a single album , and we recommend you to check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album , before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , select only the desired option with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; download the button Download and then select Download . the button selection is as long as long as you looked , until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , there is an option New to download . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug . in this case , the new pictures are selected with a star in the front box . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you can download and download the buttons , select a dialog with which you can select the target album , see the list of existing albums , where you can read the list of existing albums , in section My albums , select the target album from the list and press OK .
after having selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; charges the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . if you want to delete all you want to delete all of this , you must select it first and delete it from del@@ etion .
please note that there are no way to delete photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should not be deleted if the photos are successfully deleted , if you want to delete the camera from the camera . if you want to delete the camera storage , you should get this much faster than this camera .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ utiliz@@ ed after the photos from the camera . this may be meaningful if you have photos of various recordings into the same album . therefore , it may be meaningful , the date and time to integrate the picture in the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ ver@@ bs . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created .
the options During the transmission , three further options will be carried out before the photos are stored on the record . if you select this , the relevant entries from the EX@@ IF data will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option , you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want to use another date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % S . turn off the date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the command of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you are using the camera file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ ename in lower@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer this .
the new File name , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , is indicated below the name , the camera is stored in preview . your settings are saved and automatically used when you open the camera .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to make an automatic turn of the camera . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information which embedded your camera into the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera is not delivering &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to switch off the automatic turn off , use the button extension and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera has been made available on the picture , at which the photo was made , can use &amp; digi@@ plug . this sub@@ structure is based on the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read what information is embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in target album . if you want to change this option , use the button extension and select the option dat@@ as based on the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from their calcul@@ ator on your camera is to download . then select up@@ loading . the file dialog dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload files . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , where the images will be loaded high . select the folder dialog for the camera . choose the desired folder and press OK to load the up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a common term in this document . this means that the data can be displayed in length and lat@@ itude and which can be displayed on a map . the detection of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not just for professional photograph@@ ers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to create an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plan@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have later forgotten , where exactly the photo was done , you can view the area with a click . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users want to loc@@ alize the place of photos , or simply document this aspect , it is well the position data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the data in this fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the CONT@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and most recently about manual input from well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera to integrate a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or G@@ PS@@ Babel . you must save these data in the GP@@ X format , since this is the only format supported by the module to ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are various programs for Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and lat@@ itude and lat@@ itude , then you can use these script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the coordin@@ ate coordinates that can be created e.g. from map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation data for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; try to give as much control over his work runs as possible . in order to access these settings , you must select the settings of the digi@@ plug ; set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
action can be set on request preview or start imaging . thus , you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous ; firm , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the stand@@ ar@@ did@@ acy and copyright laws . these data will be automatically selected in the respective IP@@ TC data fields , when using the camera to be synchron@@ ised , these data will be synchron@@ ised in IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el is syn@@ onymous for the author : this field should be the job title of the photographer . this field should be a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a further description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author , then these organizations should be registered , then these organizations should be listed here . if the picture is a bearing picture , then the group or agency should be available here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions save the data into the respective IP@@ TC field . this is achieved , the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug ; these metadata is also available and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without getting lost .
image labeled as embedded labelling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you may add to your photos , with the images embedded in the images , they can also be found with in@@ scri@@ ptions , these are over@@ written by the digi@@ plug .
the page settings contains all options for the information shown if the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats . in order to specify which data types &amp; digi@@ plug , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove any file in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; Alb@@ um@@ folders that does not have any of these extensions ; also ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire by &amp; digi@@ plug ; this site can be set on this page . however , some pictures have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can only get on quick computers . if you have one , then you can get better image results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch them here . you can use the tool bar , when you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this vision can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the pictures are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in Far@@ bin@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia on the close account .
with the setting of PNG @-@ Com@@ pression , you can reduce the size of PNG @-@ files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since PNG has a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a quick host , you can set this value to a high compression . it means 1 : low and 9 high compression .
with the TIFF @-@ file , you can turn the de@@ fl@@ ate compression ano@@ g@@ ical algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is loss@@ less .
with the adjustment of loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can easily save loss . even if you write the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata is still not supported but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very quick to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the image processing settings .
the default index is that all green pixels are equal to sensitive to ultra @-@ ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option features a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the picture a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 g@@ itter@@ ing pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , whit@@ eboard used to use the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white drain is not set . standard is a solid color balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . the use of the second sensors will get the effect that sub@@ str@@ ated images will get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the top level , so the parts of your images are burned to capture as perme@@ ated white in the settings . in addition , use some unusual results as it shows the peak in various ros@@ es . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from top things .
this is possible because blue pixels is generally not so fast as green and red . &amp; cra@@ ps are therefore not trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares of the still not saturated blue pixels . naturally , this is a question how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option , select the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized for each image .
set the Lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to keep the time for the demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be conservative .
a demo algorithm is a digital image process to create a complete picture from the image data that have many cameras and is known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ wood .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w are available to you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ Cra@@ w . it produces color @-@ quality algorithm in the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the colour deviation of your lenses you can use the red and blue correc@@ ting values here . this is certainly the best method for a color variation , as it is done during raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions to be given back . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information such as the color information of a colour space in the others are the colors as precisely as possible .
behavior Questions if a picture is opened in the image processing and start color management module with raw files .
color Profile folders choose the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; this folder exam@@ ines during the start .
settings of ICC @-@ Profile You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profile . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the paint form view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures colour@@ less did not manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should not fit to the camera applic@@ ant and model that you can use . currently there are some examples like Canon , which does not contain any color ton@@ er or limbs . this means that you do not need to perform the colour mapping itself .
there are further options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can be given back , because your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colours are therefore very saturated , instead you can manually adjust to the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile for them is fore@@ seen . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style of the target : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for por@@ tray and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; educational and image processing is supported . many modules are supported to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use , and these modules are then loaded as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond , find some also in the context menu of the preview pane .
short commands for tasks that can be performed by modules , can be set in menu Short@@ cuts Settings menu .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project using htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust@@ s the time between the images , normally are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes switch the metadata a resp@@ . , which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the ad .
the camera features are displayed on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras . if you want to use a camera which is connected to the computer , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in screen display mode . currently , serial , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory are supported .
at the bottom of the bottom , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass camera from camera message .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer to display them in the display mode .
check out if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera am@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is shown in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the confirmation of confirmation of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can set the convers@@ ations of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when you delete a photo in an album , you &apos;ll find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting of a album .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be used to use &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you apply the option changes in the right side bar without feedback . otherwise , you must use the changes using the button changes .
you can also start the display of the high @-@ performance sh@@ iel@@ ding of &amp; digi@@ plug . this will acceler@@ ate the start process of &amp; digi@@ plug .
the halt at the start of the new pictures forces &amp; digi@@ p@@ ments ; the basic folder for new or dissolved albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ plug ; if something comes from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , whether it should delete it from the database .
different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ al ; in order to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can be used to select Settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs are listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; you will find further information on this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can view this to view and correction and improve the image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by selecting the entry menu / editing menu .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ s. they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ ename , current fil@@ ename and current image size shows .
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool@@ bar for fast access to the most common functions .
the editing functions of imaging change your photos . however , the original photo will not change before saving file or button saving from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo , once you have saved the picture .
so you may add a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done using file stores .
as long as you don &apos;t have saved the photo image , you can restore the original image , by using from the menu , restore the image processing in the tool@@ bar . they lose any change in which you have done in the photo since last saving .
almost any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Rep@@ ublic@@ s by selecting Edit Rep@@ lication from the menu .
if you often use this , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ z to reverse and see C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you use the &amp; L@@ MB ; click on the back@@ log or re@@ produce button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also revers@@ ed and restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can use the photos in the same album or the same keyword in the tool@@ bar , picture up , image down or the entries in the menu . if you have changes the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can get in the photo and out out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the pine@@ al menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : enhance enlar@@ ging factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want this to use the Es@@ c key . usually you can call this in the dialog dialog by &amp; digi@@ plug . you can also call this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ plug . view this section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print the image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can select single pictures or complete phrases . all images are printed from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select the wiz@@ ard from the album export wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which is important for the selected pictures and promotions for the selected pictures , also available in image processing . it will be shown if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple Click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear and disappear into the edges .
in the label view , you can input labels with unlimited size or add . note that all the special characters are allowed . this means that all the special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut into 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labels in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after which you have commented on either the button address or switch to the next picture , the labels will be saved .
besides the turn @-@ button there is a button More . you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also read the metadata in the files , but you can always have a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the evaluation section shows a valu@@ ation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sor@@ rows . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to rate several images at the same time , select these from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box to the fil@@ tering of the keyword , the keyword and a selection box with the previously applied in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ session applied .
the keyword will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the search word . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief when typ@@ ing the keyword in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for fast access .
keyword can also be set by marking the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ code .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword , if you want to select a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword keyword .
the side@@ bar keyword is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - data , sampling and search options . if additionally , one or more keyword will be used , only the cut volume of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw keywords and place . suppose you have selected several pictures to place you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply put it out of the right side bar and place a dialog that asks you if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword is reduced to no keywords , which was selected to the selection of strings + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword will be dra@@ ined and stored there . a dialogue asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule with and create and determine that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : enter the entry after which is found in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already in the database .
you can e.g. set a Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Flickr not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked on &amp; digi@@ al ; s specifically adjusted implementation .
the reason why one uses a color@@ less workflow , which can have a pre@@ f@@ able deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color@@ ized workflow , you can achieve that the colors are printed on your camera or scanners , or the colours you want to print or appear in the web from your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
if the subject comes to color scheme , then everybody wants to press whom buttons are to press . unfortunately , colour management is to provide you an adequate background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own inform@@ al decisions to make you the desired result .
if your image has been fulfilled all six listed criteria , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color scheme .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( you will find more information below )
your only other image editions include e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB of de @-@ fac@@ to Standard is standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for all so easy to use , then why should you do another color space and have to worry about h@@ d@@ ules ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ region , and the colors in the RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colors , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms side and click on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB color space or do not , you need your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ ers , since s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB , then you must use your monitor on s@@ RGB standard k@@ alli@@ bri@@ ers to use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . use it , before you try any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , devi@@ ate and contrast from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correc@@ tions automatically try to make your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lamp read@@ ings over the whole picture , so the dark point black and the bri@@ ghtest point as light as possible without changing his colour . this function is often a gast@@ ric correction for images that are dark or washed .
ab@@ using : this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ ous factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity range is as flat as possible . it also generates a very powerful operation which causes either miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in red , green and blue channel . it determin@@ es the dark and bright lim@@ estone tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ o@@ date range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the ligh@@ test of the RGB values of a picture by shi@@ fting the lowest and highest values of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the whit@@ ening of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the whit@@ ening of a photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is somewhat limited to work with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are able to do so far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . in case you can do the white ab@@ domin@@ ate in rough mode , which in 16 bit mode , your possibilities will be better to correction better .
this tool is based on a white salad of copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it via the menu entry colours white cover of image processing .
the preview can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side the original image is adapted as well as the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original protein directly , it is enough to click on the screen .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the Lumin@@ ance of Pix@@ els in this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right above , a hist@@ ogram is indicated that you can change a parameter once you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images that will see most pixel very small Lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called Lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow adjust the shadow of your photos or down to di@@ mming your photos .
An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then click on this button to calculate the color temperature of white color . this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values .
in addition , you can set the white off with the pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the Over@@ exposed indic@@ ator increases the colors , if more than a color channel of Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed . this will display the combined result in white color . this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
save buttons and store exactly this . each setting of white bal@@ ancing you have set you can save to a text file and load later again .
the button pres@@ ets down all filter values back on their standard values and their neutral white gra@@ ins . note that even neutral settings will be shown to another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding level per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high quality images , but it is only needed for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and DN@@ G .
this tool will open the same dialogue as to the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be found in the chapter color scheme .
another important tool can be found in the men@@ ue under colors of audio files . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust to multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use it for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always require the same error and you will always need the same error correction .
a very powerful way to correct expos@@ ing problems is the tool of gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug ; tool paint effects gives you four color effects , a set of solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , was called Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , a effect of the image . the colored , dark areas protected by the additional light . this result was a partial negative image of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this very interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar panels . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible . another increase is finally created , that it is not produced on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar thermal effect . the original image is ( 1 ) and the work ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , he beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a daylight produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore , a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as offers very rich colours with daylight and high contra@@ sts , but also some photograph@@ ers , especially those that hardly shows the landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the level level controls the brightness of the results and the sli@@ ps rep@@ et@@ itions . in large images the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual that you want to correct the color re@@ load and the light@@ ness of the photos . you can experiment to experiment the various color @-@ effects of your photos with the tools in the menu . if you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo of bad light conditions , you can reduce the reverse problem . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can take a good choice rather than it . if you like the result , you can confirm the outcome with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ ma / contrast / Gamma is the tool key correction to improve the exposure . also , if the dialog for this tool has been very complicated , you only need the range of shooting . in concrete the three slide below the Hist@@ o@@ Program .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active canal or the selected area . among the graph@@ s there are three shi@@ fts into the inside . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the control is to move the control kno@@ b and make sure how the image changes .
on the right side you can see the original and preview of the image . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted to see if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis is often dominated by a single column . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three kno@@ b : the upper@@ most for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently gam@@ ma@@ ids .
the three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the inputs , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output rated : the output values allow the selection manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ b that can be used in order to change the output values , for example , the compression of output values can be used as background while something else is visible in the background .
automatically : with this button , the image values will be automatically set depending on the values of the image .
save as and load : buttons are stored in the file system and re@@ loaded it later and later the Gimp levels can be used .
when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette will automatically be adjusted for all shade , means and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original Image for Red , Green , Blue and Lumin@@ ance channels .
the option Under@@ cover Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to view over exposed pixels and you can view the combined outcome of all channels . this means , you will only see the effect in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below is an example of the alignment of the entries applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview can be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . the following options are available :
Modi@@ fier channel : this sel@@ box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
besides this box are two symbols between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images that were recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode of a constant color creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a short valves to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see these bright tones with a dar@@ ker pron@@ unci@@ ation and the associated image pixels are dar@@ ker .
the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original value , create a point on this line and move it on and off , until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . any curve which you can have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp score format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and Lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ exposed indic@@ ating Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to view over exposed pixels . if in more than a channel , you will see the combined result , that is , you will only get the effect in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the Lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun@@ tones has been applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and adjusted to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the Channel Mixer of &amp; digi@@ plug ; imaging is a tool to enhance the colour channels or change the color shots of the photos .
the channel mixer is another high @-@ developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first reference like you can correct the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison on your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram shows you the corresponding color value .
the module for the module are right below : kno@@ b for red , green and building allow you to mix these channels . this is especially convenient if you want to protect the respective color components . this is especially convenient if you want to reduce the color components . this is especially convenient if you want to reduce the color components of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color appears to a visible smokers that occur from the same place in the colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can reduce your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you can reduce the colour@@ ing first .
save as and shop buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any bl@@ ender adjustment allows you to save and then load . this used file format is the Gimp @-@ mixer format .
the option Under@@ cover Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to view over exposed pixels and you can view the combined outcome of all channels . this means , you will only see the effect in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the object lumin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined picture below ( 2 ) to see .
black / White @-@ photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photographs , black / white is a step , since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film@@ strip profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lin@@ eup . this looks great , with all the scene images and fits especially well for portraits against heaven . so similar to 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Green filters .
Oran@@ gy : sim@@ ulates a black / white film volume with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange .
Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film ir@@ radiation with a red line filter . this creates some dram@@ at@@ ric effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ gs for the daily time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film ir@@ radiation with a yellow lens . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ iat@@ on : creates warm bright and middle tones to date . this is very similar to the process of failure of a print and re @-@ development in a Sep@@ iat@@ ure@@ .@@ This is typical for photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the digi@@ plug ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the digi@@ plug ; tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to an image .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task . a way to keep his attention is to keep the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ ching eye . in the picture frame , the module can be started using the image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . consistent with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , sp@@ lash it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively adds a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range is limited to 1 % to 50 % .
this with the context of decor@@ ating target image will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially when you have used the tool .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple text in a picture at any location . this also goes to several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text , and place it with its attributes . the larger image , the larger the character set must be . at the end , you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . the picture is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed till you press the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the digi@@ plug ; tools sten@@ cil , you can place a template on a picture .
the menu image template apply in the image processing can be used to put templates on a picture .
for sten@@ cil there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . but if you want to add a sten@@ cil file size . if you want to add a sten@@ cil template to the &amp; digi@@ plug , please send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mailing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool to first use , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for templates , a template &apos;s folder is reflected by the folder &apos;s folder &apos;s folder . selecting a folder will update the template templates .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
resi@@ zing : this button resi@@ des the underlying image below . if you want to use the mouse button , you need to set the template to the whole picture , check the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template on your image . the image will be automatically adjusted .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; presents three different tool for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple but produced , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
Un@@ sharp@@ ness M@@ ask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture of sharp@@ ly . you can actually use it to remove atmosph@@ eric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
Re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus , as well as most digital images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this means that sharp edges can be combined with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be viewed as a common colour . the same phenomenon is normally printed if colour points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras will normally need to create sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for the private user .
JPEG pictures have often been used to have a camera internal sharp@@ ening . however , images in raw materials must always be used during processing .
some scanners turn an edge filter already during reading the image . if you turn off this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shooting a photo with the sharp@@ ening of sharp@@ ening . that can call you with the menu entry .
this should be careful , because the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enh@@ ancing the noise of a picture the tool Re@@ focus . you can achieve it via the menu application Cor@@ rec@@ ting Re@@ focus . on Re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . use the solution to shift the image a bit soft when using the menu entry cor@@ rig@@ ate and experiment with settings . the pre@@ f@@ ist on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ ks is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help to edit the image . the preview pane showing the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often generate good results and should be tried first . if you make the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask to be strong , rust@@ ling and the impression of gr@@ ats close by sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of a edge through the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ k images of the best in its final resolution .
the sum represents the percentage between the original and the bent picture which is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a break@@ age from the maximum RGB value and the difference of difference . it can be used as a minimum difference to a edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change can be avoided by the killing and therefore f@@ use f@@ law in faces , cel@@ est@@ nuts and water surface areas .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ ks filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined image that was applied ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling value = 0.@@ 0 .
the digi@@ plug ; tool Re@@ focus is focused on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture on &amp; quot ; recur@@ ring quot ; this is better than trying the photo to sharp@@ ening . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . this is better to use better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ h . you can start using the menu by calling colors Re@@ focus in image processing .
in practice , the circular flow works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche has a very long tail , which is far away from the sw@@ elling of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ ation of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding , which is very strongly influenced by the remote pixels , which causes undes@@ irable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular file . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures should the default value 1 good results , however , if your image is very un@@ sharp should then pay attention to Hei@@ ligen@@ chers .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the room filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise level is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will be more poll@@ uted .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . this parameter is the most commonly used to avoid un@@ sharp@@ ness filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts , so you might need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or noise filter .
mat size : this value determin@@ es the size of the transformation matrix . however , a increase of the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and shop buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters will be stored for later and then can be loaded .
try to use all random , colour and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image . the reason for this is that much operations make changes not instantly visible , but later left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , eg . JPEG , you should apply the un@@ compressed image to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by un@@ sharp mas@@ ks use a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically you need to create arti@@ facts always arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it is never possible that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the Un@@ sharp@@ ness M@@ ask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better for processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ clear color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attri@@ but@@ able to in@@ sufficient lighting for auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information on the methods of the sharp@@ ness correction in digital profiles , you can read a technical comparison to English below this address .
the kno@@ b smooth the un@@ sharp@@ ness of the area has been dar@@ kened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color tin@@ te allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove non @-@ desired arti@@ facts with an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes various pres@@ ets as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider and advanced settings .
detail @-@ keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smoo@@ ther about the image . the value of 0,@@ 9 should be obtained more homogen@@ ous regions and details that no sharp@@ ening is necessary . please note that the detail maintenance should always be sub@@ divided .
direc@@ tion@@ ality Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth evenly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie @-@ shaft similar pattern create a high value wave similar pattern . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts will be found best at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum amount factor beyond all@@ es@@ . p then defined the relative smoo@@ thing . adjust this value to the level of space in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is more badly damaged , because it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
rep@@ et@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally , here 1 or 2 .
An@@ gle relief da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is selected , then it should also be small chosen . please note that small angle should generate a long runtime . so you should select this value so much and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the More quality you get by selecting this option is only low . it doubles , but we recommend it to let him out .
saving buttons as and shop exactly do this . any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and will be re@@ loaded later .
errors correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and a high CPU load bearing them . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Ab@@ ort .
below you can see how image errors are corrected using minor art@@ e@@ facts . the module is shown on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera , causing a bad film storage during the voyage . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and corrected the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; space reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise . it uses the protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable images , to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair , can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ usable ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial .
the screen shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ fting noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window settings can stay in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time that the filter per pixel are needed and can be controlled by the radius and the color in it becomes smoo@@ ther and fixed smaller bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the edge spac@@ ing . this value sets the pixel pitch to be placed in front of the filter . if it is increased , you might need to adjust the edges - if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image data can no longer get and rou@@ gh@@ ing or repro@@ ach again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole noise can be removed or noise level can occur . if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ous tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change an image . these settings don &apos;t influence the smoo@@ ther process by the details settings .
colour : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change an image . these settings don &apos;t influence the smoo@@ ther process by the details settings .
Gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ant values of the dar@@ ker ranges , which typically are stronger , but also conduc@@ ts the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of ph@@ thal@@ mic d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance re@@ acts . if it is increased , it can remove noise and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on edges . it can remove space tips and is the recommended method for this .
save under and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how to change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) and it was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cra@@ ck for your purpose . this is fortunately for a bit soft to sharp@@ ening . use a lot easier than a picture to sharp@@ ening . use tool with the menu entry cor@@ rig@@ ate and experim@@ enting with the hand side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ plug ; photo Food is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ acts .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable arti@@ facts , movie @-@ making , scrat@@ ches , compression so@@ lic@@ acts and local errors occur in digital , original or retro@@ actively digit@@ alized images . the smoo@@ thing takes the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ tures . the tex@@ turing replacement is carried out with a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ Ã . it is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce the compression of JPEG isn &apos;t perfect , in some areas , it produces some comp@@ resses &amp; quot ; art@@ e@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed image .
saving buttons and store exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and will be re@@ loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and a high CPU load bearing them . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with equal r@@ hin@@ ts . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded using a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie @-@ grain on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures was applied to an old color photo , which has been used with a scanner . you can see the scan light from the scanner lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and corrected the picture below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; Tool Hot@@ pixel offers it Hot@@ pixel by photos that have been removed using a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead , or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw mode photos that have many cameras with JPEG compression about a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ quot ; there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button Dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to take the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or light pixels by CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the assistant will re@@ mark the last dark picture and re@@ charges this automatically in the next session .
the image and preview can help you correct within the image . the preview pane displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixel are highlighted in all forms areas .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters made available :
Dur@@ able : an average of neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . it is used separately for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation for a horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 of pixel are pulled along a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . they are used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are pulled to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ Cuban surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ic , i.e. the exposed corners of a picture .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often cut the entire sensor range not equally illumin@@ ate . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ i ; ( sh@@ ady ) they can reduce the light that reaches the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ objective is also taking this behavior .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be used with the Center filter , a hole of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise in@@ filtration effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of modern cameras and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ gel that is made without this filter , the transformation with a c@@ enter@@ filter has been applied without the filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves you can control the Vig@@ net@@ izer correction filter and three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the highest density filter . the default density amounts to 2.0 , which increases the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ic , and reduce the density to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ ma , contrast and gamma settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the intensity of the pixel . you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the kno@@ b needs only positive values if you have to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re@@ adjust the exposure of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / Gamma have zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ izer correction is applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ port in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a Leu@@ ch@@ le@@ ke@@ - and contrast correction was also performed with the image of this tool .
the digi@@ plug ; linear dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses the protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . colour dist@@ or@@ ations can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ dient handles the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but he laughs at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion can be almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the second gra@@ dient . with negative values , t@@ onn@@ en@@ ann@@ ular dist@@ or@@ tions can be corrected and positive values are c@@ sen@@ sible dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of fourth degree . this value is stronger than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the reverse the parameter of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads through a correction of first gra@@ dient . negative values increase during positive the picture smaller .
bri@@ ghter : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values it increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustr@@ ating the dialog box . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values .
the t@@ onn@@ al or k@@ is@@ sen@@ sible correction should be performed before all random or mag@@ n@@ itude changes . best result in this correction as all first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a t@@ onn@@ al correction would be the effect of the wrong .
in order to help you find the best correction for you . move the cur@@ sor in the image show around the dot@@ ted lines . move it to an important place , like the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this site . afterwards , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ en- / k@@ is@@ sen@@ sible dist@@ ortion with the help of lines .
if you correct a c@@ is@@ sen@@ sible dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black ver@@ tices . you can remove them from using the cutting tool or through the zoom of this dialogue .
for most pictures , the t@@ onn@@ en@@ gel correction is enough . the next logical step for some motives as for example shots from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onn@@ al correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) to see .
the algorithm is based on a method of sim@@ ulating infrared film of G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ e.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the range for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
under the preview , you can adjust two parameters to adjust fil@@ ming and c@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ dient texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO kno@@ b changes the quantity of fil@@ ming and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color channels used to re@@ produce Infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to use black / white photos as the colour transform@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter made on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined image ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the sh@@ utter .
the digi@@ plug ; filter film c@@ aster is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ying on your images . this is known from classic high@@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known as the sensitivity of films to increase the manufacturer &apos;s large sil@@ ver@@ sion@@ ists .
the film @-@ effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to move into the past . the treated picture gets detached from daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photograph@@ ic , physical sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values need to be set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need any more gra@@ ins , then you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ effect unit on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ b to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brush are better suited for big images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the work is marked with ( 2 ) . pin@@ ching size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the digi@@ plug ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients in order to create a carbon@@ esk@@ iz@@ ze . the lines , which you imagine , are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . these would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two kno@@ b with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the coal label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses the protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important at content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is default .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the painted picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by inter@@ sec@@ rec@@ y effects . it uses the protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and let it look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses the protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image along the cross @-@ shaped lines that sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sporting photography .
radic@@ als : caught the image by rotating the pixel to focus . this sim@@ ulates the def@@ use of a rotating camera .
visual acu@@ ity : caught the image to create a non @-@ focused camera nozzle . the object appears to occur in the background .
movement of motion : caught the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : by car or train photograph@@ ers , camera .
turn@@ table Un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught painting soft@@ ly in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shining soft focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photographs or add a warm and subtle glow .
Schüt@@ t : caught the image by acci@@ dental shi@@ fting of pixel and sim@@ ulates the def@@ use of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pe them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . thus , it gives natural your images a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
dro@@ pping size allows to change the size of the drops . because the size of the image is not done automatically with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; keep an area free from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the range of tools to choose the area , e.g. a face , which should stay freely in the area , the area will remain free from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ ric filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the transform@@ ers , or transform@@ ating .
photo blow is definitely one of the wid@@ est developed tools to enlarge a photo of a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you show a picture and guess what reaches the resolution of the resolution ? how can you invent an image again ? how can I re@@ invent the missing information ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see a good work here ? try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is visible down .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available as tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the size of the original size of the original version is retained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is more badly damaged , because it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons saving as and shop are used exactly . every single use for photo may be stored as text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo blow is very fast in what it makes , but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button .
you can see an example for photo , showing a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the larger image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cutting of a photos is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse , and drag the mouse , and drag the mouse and move the mouse over you can move the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you get the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut out . thus , you can change a good overview like your photo by cutting . a new rect@@ angle allows you to create a new rect@@ angle using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button The random button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is added ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file to store the newly added photo .
in the sight area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shi@@ fting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in high @-@ format the larger value of the height and in width is assigned to width .
the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal , regardless of whether you use c@@ entimeter , inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area for the maximum possible level , depending on the selected relationship and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you are stored the cutting tool , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly help enable to allow help to assemble your pictures better . these help are :
harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ rule , harmonious triangles are designed to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmonious triangles at the diagonal .
golden center : the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ il@@ us mus@@ sel or the aper@@ ture sheets of a sun@@ flower . it shows in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you already used the golden partition in all times when you use your images , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 8 , 13 , 34 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divider is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that this rule is defined as visually harmon@@ ic .
the golden center represents the liquid aid lines if you comp@@ ose a picture . these help are listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results to get closer to your photos . compared to the third @-@ rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye can be put into the core of the composition . it can be a line to the core of the composition . this can simply be just there without the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the golden triangles are also from the above discussed golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmonious triangles , golden triangles are not equ@@ il@@ an@@ gled triangles . diagonal to these lines can be seen as a static object .
when you use golden triangles to break your frame your frame is called dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach different .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . this way you can customize the color of the lines your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you do a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things came around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug . choose Trans@@ action free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn off your picture with the sli@@ ghtest angle . the values on this slide is specified . by default , you can reset the slide again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right above .
to help your help the module makes a horizontal and a vertical line available . move the cur@@ sor over the two lines . after you fix it via an important point of the picture , you can fix it to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function transformation into the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option sli@@ ps a bit after rotation . however , follow the above warning .
all per@@ vers@@ al transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas , created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas , created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle links below : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle to the right below : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a bit s@@ lu@@ te . for a single adaptation this effect is small but two adap@@ t@@ ations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this .
after which you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes on the corners . a way to ber@@ some is the picture with transform@@ able cutting out of image processing .
the tool kit is used to move a portion of the image into one direction and move the lower part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image will be dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via Transform@@ ers .
sciss@@ ors choose your image by using the horizontal angles and vertical angle . if you press pre@@ ferences , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
to your help you will see a vertical and horizontal line built . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image .
after having performed the sh@@ ear , the picture will be caught a bit . for a single sh@@ ear , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots generated twice as much destruction and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is the picture with transform@@ able cutting out of image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type as these libraries comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
based on the depen@@ dency of other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats on this site . however , they will always be JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; displays only files in formats to the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions ; you can change this list of file extensions . in the section configuration you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras can even select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ itter results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also be loss@@ less when indicated in settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read using Wikipedia , The Lumin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in JPEG or TIFF . in the section configuration you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is listed in &amp; digi@@ plug ; all support cameras can be seen below at the Web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw form@@ at@@ as supported by &amp; digi@@ plug ;
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ plug ; but if you click on a movie file , click &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies to play the program for playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in Chron@@ icles . you can only go forward if you go back before .

all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please look for further information in the camera .
K@@ IP@@ I module can be exported to a series of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth Earth .
if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four alignment with the white module .
many tools you need the photo processing are in &amp; digi@@ al ; included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft@@ marks , rou@@ gh@@ ing , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture .
( 1 ) : this progress bars shows the status of the filter to the current picture . links to him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the fore@@ sight . these modes are :
vertically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected thumb@@ nail .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower picture shows the filter below the selected thumb@@ nail .
vertically divide . the left pane displays the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
parts horizont@@ ally . the upper area shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the pre@@ viewing area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn on to show transfer and exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the picture and place in the part of the picture , from which you will see a preview in the left part of the dialog .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is one help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all entries from the last use of the module are noted .
the aspect bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider uses an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature program . press C@@ trl ; put button in button to draw a square . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is , of course , which contains your pictures of Ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit colour pall@@ ets and can be used to use colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are supported by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the entire system or only one user . in the last case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and Zul@@ u used colors .
in the palette range you can select from a list of pall@@ ets installed or search the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet screen as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is activated in the color button , the color is inserted from the cur@@ sor on cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ writing . this mode can be set , by selecting the check box over@@ writing under the cur@@ sor .
a selection which has been generated as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions , trim and inser@@ tion .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in clip@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line values , if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .
the colours in a pallet and the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; Graph@@ ene . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are available in science , especially in science , especially in computer science , especially in science ; - or t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; - or t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; Graph@@ ene . the &amp; graphic viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it offers the following functions :
integration into &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; Kate ; the graph is calculated and in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graphics in &amp; Kate ; open or open the graphics in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; component

other required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pre@@ set the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph@@ s . required :
the main window displays the open graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . at the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , the main window will open only as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file . click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files are selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zoom is limited in both directions by factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just changed &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be shown :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ loaded , or if you want to ignore the change , so you can change your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings @-@ graph@@ viewer ; see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; eg , open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at command line , have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; instance , or want to display the invitation in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change with the setup dialog .
with the program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also define how the graph is to be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be selected freely .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which will fit on this page will be ignored . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be completed by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page Er@@ ne@@ ut Laden has the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been changed in hard drive , &amp; eg ; by another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charging or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify if a graph is open outside a running session . you can open a default behavior in a new window or specify in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is asked .
the page seat management is the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify a default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine what start to be asked .
the context menu , usually at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens further options :
here you can select under various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Layout algorithm . entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm sets the edges into the same direction ( from top to right or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ en@@ compass cards as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ sensitive Graph@@ ene . it produces represent@@ ations according to the jump model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , the same is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ Algorith@@ m creates a spring@@ time graph model . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istik and includes a multi @-@ gr@@ inder for the treatment of large and clu@@ ster@@ ed graph@@ s .

image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window , and call the menu . to upload a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization . this file contains , of course , data that have been recorded at the same time as the images of your camera .
when the file load is loaded , the coordinates will be performed in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore , the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone .
setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the maximum deviation for GPS time and camera @-@ time . is the deviation below . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that reality in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put this boundaries here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have set a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog you need to use a button to the next time , just use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set in . if you want to be found and enlarged with the displayed region . if you want to have an adequate accuracy , the card must always be selected manually . the card can always be picked manually . the map can be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here &apos;s a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums the as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will allow UTF @-@ 8 encoding to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab choice allows you to select all these albums . the albums will not select one big number of albums . in the field below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the field below is the Al@@ ben@@ ign and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely explained by itself . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in the picture . otherwise , the picture will be displayed right with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show .
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . choose a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything you will create there .
if you selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF data of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures .
with Other colour depth , you can change the default color depth . this naturally influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to specify some of the settings from the album rider for thumb@@ nails , which are small pictures that can be displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user to how far the action is . press departure to break the process .

the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG loss@@ less module is a tool to change images without aff@@ ecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images , images listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is rising because no compression of the colour transform@@ ations takes place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that you can connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g . attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I Team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the import function dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image will be copied to the button OK .
this function is not working with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ di@@ ers module is a tool to convert a range of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can also be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length of length . this module uses M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic image file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV in the Sli@@ de format .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD to your DVD player . to burn media , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first , you need to select the images that will be packed into the MPEG di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create the module via Extras MPEG di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures you selected from you are under image files in the Portfolio . you can also change sorting the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and NTSC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image is specified below . a lower value produces very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and the path of the created file can be set under Name of the MPEG output file . if possible , keep the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , you can start the generation of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink the generation of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer , you can go back or enjoy a cup of coffee when you &apos;re back again .
if a note appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick Packages to the right below .
the printer coach allows to print multiple images on a sheet paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is useful to print or print using the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats to JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ ckers from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w , that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ c@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Image Converter appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides , if the camera settings are to be used for white and red / blue amplifier . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera is working in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and adjust the conversion results . JPEG uses a loss algorithm and is produced for the smallest file sizes .
tagged image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses the loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you prefer to process your pictures frequently or later , otherwise you should not use the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations allowed to deteri@@ or@@ ate the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a memory format the metadata that contain in the RAW file are stored in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use this process .
the stack@@ ing machine mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time . use this mode , for example , for testing on a single picture which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available , however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of one album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the one .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image down or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in dimension . width or height of the image will be automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen format .
un@@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is altered at this option .
printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo imaging . the user can set the resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is possible to change the size of the same images before . more pictures can be found on the list of paintings and place there .
after which you have launched the module , the images window will be displayed by you in selected pictures . click on the button images to add additional images . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right page .
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and place it in order to add the list of images to be used .
with the button pictures you will remove the selected pictures from the list of paintings .
after you have selected all images you can open with the button OK the new message window of your email clients . you just have to add the addresses and the bedding . the pictures selected by you are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
please do not consider too many pictures at once . most email accounts are constra@@ ints for the size of e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send several emails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail service , you have to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments will be merged into a text file and included the mail .
the PNG format below the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted amongst the loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore need PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG File Format and select the original files in JPEG format , the original Ex@@ if@@ config file will be added to the images .
if the process is ready , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button closing this window s@@ lie ? EN .
after starting the Modul@@ s Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au window , a window with questions like you will have shown your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open@@ GL &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image trans@@ itions by Open@@ GL . you need to have a corresponding graph card , otherwise the dens@@ or will be very slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the file name indicates that the fil@@ ename of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop makes it possible to display the presentation in an end loop . then you can manually cancel the Es@@ c ; Cancel reply .
the pictures randomly select that the images will be shown in random order . so it won &apos;t be the sequence of pictures in the album .
among the images , the tim@@ ely distance between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . they should be taken out before you show the presentation to your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random , choose from any transition between the pictures and another effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool bar at the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner by switching it .
with this tool bar you can start the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the dip .
at the left lower screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the whole number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g . attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the current selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ men@@ ues , as background for your K@@ DE work@@ space .
once you have signed your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse through this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keyword entries are available .
in the browser window , you will see the categories you have submitted your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current thumb@@ nails are viewing .
when you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you select another person only select the images on which both persons are visible . by this sel@@ ective method , you can restri@@ ct the number of pictures shown by a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view images of your search area .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . however , you can save with &amp; photo@@ album ; but of course also for locations , keywords and other categories , which you have defined themselves . see the picture .
in order to view images next to the name , select the button that &apos;s right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , please note that you can view the view for each category . in the appearing context menu , please note that you can view symbols for each category . ( if you do not have a list of sample words ) .
but you have to specify the image for each individual person . in order to view this , you will need to select the image editor , as shown in the picture , and select the image factor according to your wishes , and select that part of the image will be displayed and cut off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to locate the entry in the main window , you will see a dialog , which is very similar to the dialog for laying the image properties . this dialog can look at the picture once more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you enter a string in the field label or description , the labels and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . for example , the date may either have a part of the overall date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , rather like to try features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick start , screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; album photo album ; and in the first dialog you can start the demo , if you start &amp; Book photo album ; for the first time , or choose a few example pictures you can start and you can try the functions of &amp; album photo album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . a picture of this bar you see here : as the name suggests , this glue shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
the time bar can display several different time units . each bar will show you another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can view a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time bar can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview pane in the database ( if you select a date , the time will always view the current date of the current images , if you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a range of time bar by clicking the mouse button , and the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , so select the time details . if you want to select a range , you can cancel the selection , by clicking on a bar of the time bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; presents two possibilities to create HTML web pages with your pictures . the one is integrated into &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module is available ; integrated version , which you can create via the File menu HTML ...
before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas , layout and target . in the following , each area is described above .
first , enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo album ; HTML example , you see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; photo@@ album ; -@@ Export file is to be seen on the viewing side . download information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to see that all pictures of a party are obvious . for example , that all pictures of a party are obvious . at the moment , you can &apos;t use all pictures of a party . so you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images before particular viewing .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why it has not been developed specifically .
below the page you can set different resolutions for the images . in this way , those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , no pictures you can download the resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . it can therefore browse your pictures with low resolution , search for a lower transmission time . if he wants to see a larger image , it changes into a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best choose for all your HTML files , select a basic folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first , you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the memory location . here you can select either a folder or by K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check whether they have been created for the basic folder a URL , after the pages have been created , the URL you specify here should be . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the files created by you have not been created in the final target file , you must manually copy them manually . this is the import function of the files , and this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the right configuration options have all three on basic folders or URLs . in these cases , a sub@@ folder will set , whose name will set you in the output folder .
if you are interested in a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if you have already checked your photo information , people on pictures , recording , etc . , you &apos;ll need to make a photo album , you don &apos;t have to work with &amp; make photo album ; this work is not even done .
with &amp; photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can be imported into your database with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you differ in that file itself is stored in the file or whether the images can be stored in the file , that you can easily pass all the images in the file . the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for two times . first , the images that have indicated in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file , you will find the images of the URL that you have indicated in creating HTML files . this is , of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by using HTML export .
following the following , the dialog for Export Pictures is described , which you can export about the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is intended to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three sel@@ ections are available :
when you select Manu@@ ally to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically copied to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; album photo album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most pictures already are compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is not very small . if you want to comp@@ ress the files , simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is to limit a maximum picture size . if you would like to send your friends pictures , because the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image is maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you can select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Menu Import , select &amp; Buy photo album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you must select which pictures you want to import , after , in which folder you want to copy images .
it can be that , if you are interested in the category people of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked for a database , where categories of imported file should be imported to which categories can be found in your database .
in fourth step , you can download the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture .
it needs to be easy to browse and watch images : if you look at pictures , you often want to view images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) to find information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the review and view , until ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ t@@ ations .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . but it has been extended and today , it also takes your videos . at many places in this guide , it will be talked about images , but frequently includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want to .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; lists the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start another database with images , you can start &amp; album photo album ; with option -@@ c . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / Images / Images / Images / Photo Album .
via the menu entry settings &apos; photo album ; set up to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual will be explained to you the various settings .
on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can call for the viewing and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed support is available to the F1 key and one click on the desired option .
it was described in you as you can define different properties , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a cinema as in .
in view the setting options , which are available to you for fixed the member groups . with the listed selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window half there is a list of the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . download information here on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called through the modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page you can call through the modules itself .
since the modules are used together with multiple applications , you can try to test these modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for this reason , you should always try to call these images using the command &gt; Photo@@ Album \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell you , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo album ; not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can not support their images in albums ; this kind of order is not supported , it sim@@ ulates the order for some modules that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
here sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that shows you the picture preview currently .
apart from the current album you have to have a photo album ; the modules are also offered a list of albums . here is a photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is a record for the module .
or it will be the category which you have specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums , will be used , for example , if you choose the category people , will do &amp; play photo album ; so do if you were chosen to view this and add the module to the module .
since some modules are removed with &amp; photo@@ album ; you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select in the modules which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen when you start &amp; photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the moment , it contains no more information about your pictures . at the moment we will see on this window , but now click on this window to show you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with notes , where the image has been recorded individually or for a larger number of images certain comments on the same time . if for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per , and all images were taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and Brow@@ se as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you can use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text field , by selecting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use them again , if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the change of images within the list , if you are shown for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find that the used names are post@@ pon@@ ed , which can find persons faster and arrange .
if you prefer an alphabet@@ ically sorted list , click on the icon to check out the list below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image , you may want to edit all the selected pictures and set these images with notes . click on the front and back buttons which are below the preview of the image right above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries to once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all over the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
the picture shows a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to indicate that it is a special group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the related dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry into an existing or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also make an entry into a category or sub@@ category . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabet@@ ically . see here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move the individual elements of the note dial@@ ogs to form and post@@ p@@ one the bodies that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move it . you can also make a separate window by moving it out of the window range . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs , click on the button Options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also send a frame to it completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and then click on the window to view it . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you can view the entry pictures in your browser , you get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or all images you can &apos;t have a filter . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , please try it .
if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is furnished as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this picture will be displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding images from you and select either the remove key or select in the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album , which allows you to create a solution for this problem . you can also use the photo album that you may have saved on your hard disk . of course , you &apos;ll have to store images anywhere in the database . in the picture you can download the view of &amp; Photo@@ Album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , is not stored on the hard disk . this is , for example , pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that you can preview the preview of these images . you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you would like to see this , you need to copy files from the folders . if you want to avoid trouble as you want to avoid using your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk to store all the images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with your name privacy . if you want to remain a little more privacy , you can view the images that you can do for others to see and click on the menu . alternatively , you can also select all pictures you want to watch your little Sister everything except current view .
this enables you to specify what images will be hidden in the case of the F@@ all . if you want to put the laptop to your little sister , simply select all the images that you have locked up , click on to lift the pictures again .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set this password , select password in your personal menu .
please remember that this picture protection is not very secure . you can read or delete all images on the hard disk and the other can be able to read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only allowed to remove the password as un@@ encrypted text ; not very familiar with your photo album ; not very familiar to stop the views of private images .
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and talk about hours of course , of course you want to look at any time . for this reason it has a picture _ and video viewer . you can preview it from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the image , but additional information you can enter on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the upper part of the image you want to see and elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed on the viewer . all these options can be displayed in the context menu .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see , matching entries to this show . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen persons from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene is selected .
if you load several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the key image and skip down the picture . you can go to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and finish . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can then run it as a slide show . then you can get a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can be controlled by clicking the C@@ trl key and Plus or Min@@ us . then the slide is stopped by the buttons C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability to change the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer you can go into the image and zoom out into the image . with the Min@@ us key , you can enter into the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and displays the result of the ZO@@ OMS .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equivalent button , the ZO@@ OMS is shown that every pixel is equivalent to a pixel image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations work in videos that are in and out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can &apos;t turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you can view images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you will have forgot to view this name . in the moment you can view the view and select the configuration dialog of the picture to view this name . but you &apos;ll probably prefer to mark the image and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see pictures on paper . in order to see which photos you want to start the viewer and see it as good or bad , while you see one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features , while you see them . features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you can press the appropriate letter . in view a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have added features to your pictures , you can view all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so do you want to use one module to copy the selected pictures to a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail view . if you view categories in d@@ re view view , then you can press features for the picture by clicking the image , after the image has been selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to paint &amp; photo album ; paint on the picture .
the master@@ piece is not stored with the image but in the database . on the way you can reverse your mixture later .
in a picture you can view a picture on the painted frame . in order to disable the painting from the context menu . in order to disable the painting from the context menu , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above on the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must have the use of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should have absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire models .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all the objects are already selected with the object .
to add a new object into the object tree , select the position to insert the object and click the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if possible positions are possible , the next drop @-@ down menu will be inserted , so you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed traits , click Apply to Apply this changes . if you have invalid values , you can copy the input errors and then click on address or reject the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter a user documentation in the setup dialog box , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 also contains user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the self @-@ view view .
press the full texture , and a small example of the scene is rendered by the chosen texture , even if you want to selected a texture element ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the control points and it is displayed a small cross in the wire @-@ view pane . this cross marks the center of sc@@ aling and rotation and the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift through drag with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visual level . you can specify this value relative to the visual level of the parent or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar selected vision level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window adjustment as pres@@ et@@ ting . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graphic views right .
if you do not like the default window ordering or if you need any other arrangement , you can set it any arbitr@@ ary . you can also store multiple windows and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or under an existing view , drag the early or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the early or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views to each other , drag the early in the middle to a different view . you can then switch between the opinions on the card and switch up in the opinions .
the last possible window ordering are floating views . views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to fix a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginner on Desktop or click on the little to the left above show arrow in the beginning bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the early bar . to close the plug , click on the little square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu view you can find entries for each type of views . new views are simple , you can anchor at any point .
the current window view can store you with view window instructions ... save it . it will be displayed in which you can save the window ordering using an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ew it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to Ren@@ dering , this program has been installed properly . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar , or select the menu entry View .
a RE@@ N@@ DER mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s . it determin@@ es the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to mount a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can give any number of RE@@ N@@ DER modes , from a quick preview of images in highest quality .
if you click on the RE@@ N@@ DER symbol in the tool@@ bar , or select &quot; RE@@ N@@ DER modes ... &quot; the following dialog will be opened :
each RE@@ N@@ DER mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the lower image . if you want to ren@@ ew a small area of the picture , select the box section sub@@ section and specify the image section for ren@@ dering into the input fields .
in combination quality you can select the features , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for ren@@ dering . this is from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of RE@@ N@@ DER features can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture is saved with only one beam of pixels , there can be different mistakes . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ ffed effects in curves and lines , besides that they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses an technology called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general , pictures with this feature better .
when you switch off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , connects and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technology is a super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard , an adap@@ tive , non @-@ re@@ ital@@ ic method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is adap@@ tive and adap@@ tive because each pixel is always further divided and adap@@ tive because the record depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray of pixels . if the difference between the values specified in pixels will be set to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated for a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceed the pre@@ specified threshold , then the pixel will be followed up into 4 sub@@ sections , which can be followed individually and can be adjusted to other sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce the Ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; rays a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the associated beams have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry into Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the complete command @-@ cat@@ cher by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of messages .
if you don &apos;t want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can export objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the source code in the editor , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the slides .
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ dering . usually this is PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
if you click on Help in the self @-@ view pane , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . please click here the path to your document and version 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ fel@@ d@@ data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if you want to enter files , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle to view the view pane in the camera view and in the window type label .
you can set the points of points on the pitch in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . here , you can adjust the pitch separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling , and scripts .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore better nails for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detail level for two directions .
if you cross your detailed projec@@ tions for extended projec@@ tions , all projec@@ tions are used . extended projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions of perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives better rap@@ proch@@ ement for projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall is thrown behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , a bottom is placed below the objects . the bottom is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you tick check @-@ in , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for the ren@@ dering of the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . precise details of the parameters can be found in the RE@@ N@@ DER modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders is explained how to create and store shut@@ ters .
the drop @-@ down panel order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order in the start of the program .
the list existing window orders indicates all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window type is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below names shows all views of the selected window ordering . new views can be created with the button and remove selected views using the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the windows under the existing window , with the previous view pane highlighted in the main window , it doesn &apos;t create a separate window .
so you just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start with more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should get the ultimate but easy scene : a ball at a level .
but you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully , before you compl@@ ain about it as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to the ren@@ dering as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t add light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image .
if you have all f@@ law@@ lessly installed , see the first boot from &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre@@ set window rules :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry to delete .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera is watching the whole scene you can create . in particular , this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when they click on it , you can find the content of the view@@ properties found in which the different parameters of the camera . in the user documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but please note that the camera is in view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired place .
if you turn the button or press the space button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could add an angle ( insert the body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a permanent method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite layer as a floor :
a good advice : choose the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button address or the space bar . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view also shows the plain , even at the moment only as a limited scale . if you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
if you see the object tree accurately , you will see the different parameters of the property . in this case , you will find the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get some of these parameters . select shi@@ fting and set the values as follows :
just pick the floor to place its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something single in the moment .
in both cases a dialogue will open in which you can select as the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the property tree . you can preview the name in the self @-@ view pane ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button look like the pigment now looks .
of course , the pigment displays only a matt black material , because you can still have settings for the pigment . remember to check the look of materials at any time with a click to preview . also , there are many options , but now take the easiest way .
if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ ame your picture with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result :
of course , this is not the color name . you need to specify two new attributes . in the color list , select two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select any color in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; &quot; &quot; this step should simply be able to execute the basic work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , as you should have understood the basic work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; it &apos;s just as easy as the ground can be created : &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the view of the object characteristics , you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the bul@@ let or push the button contact with the bottom . otherwise , the ball will float above the ground as you have shifted the floor to a unit down .
of course , the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball is like a matt black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball you can now assign a material now . as already in the floor , enter the sphere a pigment than color :
select the name of the object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on a sphere of Pig@@ ment , then select Unic@@ ol@@ oured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to introduce some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen shots and click on address or press the space bar .
the settings of gloss effect and reflection showed some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if met@@ ic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of these options , which offers you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a RE@@ N@@ DER method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you encounter a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the Ren@@ derer hypo@@ thet@@ ical rays coming from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes in the scene and how atmosph@@ eric effects are reflected in the scene and like an atmosph@@ eric effects such as fog . so the scene pixels for pixels is processed .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene is to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY file usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you can open a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if there is a new file , you need to type a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last stored version . any changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you have not saved any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the most recently converted command . this menu entry can only select if you have used Edit reverse .

a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to prevent rough surfaces , without model any hi@@ ves on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
basic objects are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic objects . these models are then continued to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to specify the surface of an object color to pixel basis using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ dos show ; is a more convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing .
pictures can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .

the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side bar on the right edge that provides you important information and promotions to the selected pictures . you can also view this page , where you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes pictures to scan and calibr@@ ate .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy use to scan images that do no more power than images and store . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store a dialog for storing or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by checking the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set in the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanners is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel reply &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; finish .
other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
in order to insert a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ trigger and then scan the scan range for the final scan , the preview can be started by the preview button .
to select the image better the user can enter into the image and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom as well that the complete preview can be fit into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , the picture will be stored and weak ? EN leads to a break and you will go back into the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the button settings the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can preview the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to store the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can open the dialog for each image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select saving without a file name .
this setting defines where the images will be saved without a fil@@ ename . if the pictures are stored according to any scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for storing images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog . the automatically stored picture will be recorded every time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can customize the image quality . this value also changes the compression value while saving . if select the image quality is not selected , the default value of Q@@ t is used .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a list of these short@@ cut and its function . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cut , and you can choose to set up with the right mouse button in the Player window and select the key mouse button , by clicking the right mouse button in the Player window and choose short commands ...
you may need to set existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this makes your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context @-@ browser , playlist , play@@ lists , playlist browser and scripts ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok additionally has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of dependence . please check in your script if any required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so the user will not run a script .
Beg@@ in &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; s@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you will quickly find that writing from scripts relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be given to each K@@ DE installation .
most scripts enable the run of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used mostly . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send messages to all the scripts . in this reason , strings have to continuously monitor their standard input and react appropri@@ ately to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . in order to load the setup dialog . if a script is launched , Amar@@ ok put the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now come &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume indicate a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ able Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le , Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be found . in order to remove the associated entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ ize script ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ated , or if the user stops a script if the user sends SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example . for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok@@ s script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using a web server . we recommend to be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which is optionally also available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which the user can clearly recognize the archive as an Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 accept only script packages with the expansion of amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and follow the link to the wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ r . for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features , and yet surprisingly simple to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of looking through endless menus . you may also search for a particular item from thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting Browser and Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then if your decision is still hard for you . and if your decision is still hard , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used to make your music listen to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ experience your music !
normally you need to set the Amar@@ ok sources in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any difficulties when you encounter problems . if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has some options that you can enable or disable the configure @-@ point using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ ile options , certain depen@@ den@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system Requi@@ re@@ ments .
de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several maps to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
Player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is switched off , only play@@ lists window will be displayed .
stimul@@ ating activity : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option switches the experimental function of the function bar@@ ometer .
consistent shape : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme for the mood of the mood .
image files are stored in the music files : this function is only available if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on the memory location of the respective music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser is created by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if a browser is needed .
if you are using other browsers : you can specify the path to another browser , which is not listed in the list .
play@@ lists when saving , stores the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep up the piece in a piece of change , the play@@ lists window opens , to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
when you change part change to the context menu , the context menu will automatically display the context of the next piece .
in the appearance , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is sub@@ part in three parts .
in font section , you can select the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player window and context browsers . press on selecting ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom color scheme you have even the tor@@ ment of choice and can set up your own color scheme . use it among them activated paint selection for front and background colour .
playback in the start will continue , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start playing automatically with the piece on the site , with whom they stopped at last end .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to use the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click here to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text in the O@@ SD .
its own colors use the option to adapt the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on color spaces will open the dialog for color selection . if sel@@ ections are not activated , the pre@@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the input field display shows the text in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so you can set that on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment , the O@@ SD is to be released .
select the Audio output card to select a audio driver from the select box . some drivers activate further entries in this map card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , select the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for a folder in the collection with its name , check the check box next to its name . this section includes the check boxes for setting how to select the selected folders .
browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folder to music .
super@@ v@@ ise changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( for example if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary modifications to your collection .
play@@ lists import : bring out that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the playlist browser .
the part Collec@@ ting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you select between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , the MySQL setup is still necessary .
the MySQL facility will be used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; this is where the calcul@@ ator is installed , where the MySQL database is entered , which is located under the port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
please use User@@ name : and password : to insert data you need for the connection to the database .
the card re@@ lie@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can provide the names of played pieces at a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding current piece of music .
here , enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send out pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it to transmit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar games to interpre@@ t : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar artists played at each of the played pieces . note : you can &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix Systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screen shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you need k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included , as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to be compiled for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to comp@@ iling k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD are ahead , that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as they provide excellent development environment .
probably you &apos;ll find a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can watch this error in the Tag@@ li@@ b @-@ library under bus@@ h@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang it in this bug that has caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is where Tag@@ li@@ ad is freezing during reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file system . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bus@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it &apos;s something sophisticated .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this will lead to dra@@ fting the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , then disable automatic shut@@ down when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a common crash , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is due to write many program data as UTF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but it is not known as Unicode . the following Perl script solves the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ 4 = get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / rep@@ et@@ ition / dynamic playlist ) . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click on the status centre using grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol that shows up to three times .
if you get this error : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ .@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok used the correct Q@@ t library . this can be viewed with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok is the right version first .
there are some ways . most of the installation problems are clear by the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear only one error if something is located in the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting of an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come from there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window was converted into the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , must be displayed in the playlist and select the evaluation column . click anywhere in the new application column , and select a column . click anywhere in the new application column , and you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Rel@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From play@@ lists remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall , just like you would do it with other files too . that &apos;s easy : - )
in the tool bar , directly next to the addition button , you can save the playlist . click on it .
probably missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . check out also after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the Equalizer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) and you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras Equalizer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question of what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support quite any memorable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and PNG !
it may be ! perhaps , use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied with default any MP3 Decoder ( for pat@@ ent@@ ric reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows several applications to use the same time and can be reached simultaneously by the d@@ mix module ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) . look at the help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem mur@@ m@@ ly and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another ink ( e. g. ) .
this does not do &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you don &apos;t forget that media is first de@@ coding , you would only listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you want a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , deco@@ ded it and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS deco@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can pass directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the sound @-@ server sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable the sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ arity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ arity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( see next point of FAQ ! ) .
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause un@@ disturbed playback . read this bug report . in your AL@@ SA configuration file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts Driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ such as &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less jobs respond . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the g@@ amer fa@@ q . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask IR@@ C channel # g@@ lim@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download up@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then you will then run G@@ ST @-@ register with G@@ ST @-@ config ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ lim@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register . now , start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .

includes the current project . if a project has changed and not stored , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you can then disc@@ ard between store and changes . furthermore , you can cancel the lock and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will not ask for any project stored for any project , just as you would have inv@@ oked for each project file .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any un@@ saved project will be asked what should happen to it , as if you were called file closing .
if you call this entry , you can choose from the appearing dialog files to add to the project . if you &apos;re recording the files directly from the top view into the Project View , the files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; open the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the current project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the characteristics dialog for the current project . here you can carry many projects related settings . any project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the meaning of what is that ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful when you &apos;re using files for a multiple session . this is useful if you &apos;re not using files for a multiple session . it is thought for you rather than help , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . this function causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this function blocks no files from the medium , it only bl@@ ends the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a image from a CD , which you might need to burn , if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DVD Copy dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will also open the DVD Copy dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also allows you to burn a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also be able to burn a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion medium has also not been supported , so it must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of source media in the original form . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW drive . thus , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
opens the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) which it &apos;s deleted completely . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write the choice between write modes and incre@@ mental .
burn a CD image . the dialog asks you to burn a CD image . the dialog asks you to burn a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file is not currently supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not currently supported but other tools like N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you to burn a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source that can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button .
a previously @-@ read DVD video can be converted to you . this dialog window appears normally after reading a DVD in the ingredients , but can also be used all@@ ein@@ clu@@ ded . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , code settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the set medium . this information is shown in the ingredients and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar is indicated on the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is bl@@ inded .
if the folder view is activated or from . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents is activated , their content is displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or throwing media .
switches the contents view or out . the summar@@ ize view allows to select and drag files into the project view . the summar@@ ize view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switch off the head @-@ off in the project view or from . the head @-@ hand is a narrow range that contains only visible , if the project view has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to change the keyboard regulations for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key rules below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be set to burning CDs and DVDs , so you must enter the administrator &apos;s password for system administrator ( root ) .
the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here you can work general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work correctly . this dialog is intended to customize and intended for the programme adjustment .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications are equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope of functions , so your taste and the type of tasks are crucial for which the bit@@ rate can be given .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then there is something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , which have all &amp; k@@ ites , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for creating new projects .

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; is an audio CD ; read out for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can be easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and of many enco@@ ders ( compressed @-@ free compression ) are supported ( default free compression ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD , read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or also in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is compiled . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ fore@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ al@@ ers have already been installed . however , all these programs are already installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile it . if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction on Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio Quality and Com@@ pression Fac@@ tors .
a word for copying the protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device is not possible to cra@@ ck it . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . simply avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier audio CD ; s !
while activation only needs to be made ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , after the daily use of a &amp; CD . this leads ( hopefully ) for understanding the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble on the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which co@@ dec programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from Free@@ D@@ b from the internet or can completely work without network , where everything is collected manually .
this is only a brief list of the main window commands . on the page step by step guide you will find further information such as this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of the program .
starting on request , the CD@@ DB request of the CD data is available on request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the last case , first connection to the Internet . )
starts reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the Code Settings tab in the setup script - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default dialog , it has been configured in the Code Settings tab in the Settings dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected to code a full &amp; CD . read and add .
opens the settings dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ res ; with different maps ( such as Encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you must go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ dec and compression rati@@ os and helps you with the right code .
if no audio information is lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there is also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files .
in the audio formats supported by data compression , depending on your psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG files are the most common . OGG may today have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences are less important because both co @-@ quality produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not such &apos; freely , l@@ ame will still be included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower quality of lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG recordings is present .
MP3 - when music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer transparency to most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi@@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , comp@@ ress rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good gen@@ ds for music by young people , portable devices and car parks . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Er@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without consideration to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are entered manually or by the program automatically from Free@@ D@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can transfer / used to produce the folder and file names and the characteristics of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the aid to the enco@@ ders explain the switch to these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ can be added ; the result looks like this : ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ res ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database to read / enter the audio CDs that you can download / enter the audio CDs instead of yourself in the calcul@@ ator . it &apos;s to note that all the other information can be downloaded into the computer . it &apos;s to note that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ aster ) is not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; besides , the information can be added to the music company any more or less worth@@ less , so can neither the artist nor the music company can be added any more anyway by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtualization .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; is active in a check box . for use Free@@ D@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ ake ) address as the system used in the system . in this kind of configuration , it appears , but the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the server ( This can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ops ; for use Free@@ D@@ b , the ge@@ ographic should be used on the next surrounding mirror . this saves bandwidth in the network and re@@ sembles the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror ser@@ ver@@ n for online demand of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; save into WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rum@@ ours that it wants to know cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia , search in the source code .... It was always the best choice for reading Audio CD . to note is that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet been done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to save the read @-@ out WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can and thus select the desired file format . at the first time , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression of audio data ) can be added to the tab of the code . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer Package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution , before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined co@@ al@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , you can get more information about his switch by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this may have many reasons . check the device of the device format of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading real of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to run both programs with a command line in a terminal block . that could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD . check out the sleeve &amp; CD . this will not succeed !
there is a chapter by step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still un@@ sure to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will make enough information to set up those areas , which make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to read all and our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame have already been installed on your computer . both programs should be provided as a compiled pack@@ et for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd is and that you own scre@@ enings ( eg ; by trying to copy them into account ) .
the first section covers basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; something which probably is done just once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for any ex@@ iting &amp; CD .
here we determine the required co@@ des@@ erer for compression of music ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) and which is used as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . because we are la@@ zy , we share the program using the Free@@ D@@ b to download the &amp; CD data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change a &amp; CD at any time , if the matching settings are found .
the equipment name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / scores .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device title of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , there is also a look at the file / etc / ste@@ er and an attempt to use the existing entries for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map Card General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here , an additional conversion will be defined . in our example , everything will be shown so often as shown in the screen photo .
just ask for incomplete information , so you will be informed when details are missing to test@@ ify ( tags ) .
the map card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortably and let the &amp; CD data automatically download via the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected to the Internet while reading &amp; CD , so that he can access the Free@@ D@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , will be a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , when you &apos;re un@@ happy with a low risk , if you want to change easily . the directory entry / fil@@ ename is changed with Con@@ qu@@ order - &gt; ren@@ ame it and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
aside from this example is further to note : if you want to manually enter the selection fields and Free@@ D@@ b if you are using Free@@ D@@ b in offline mode , if you want to use Free@@ D@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for the retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD . how does the system know which data should get the CD ? read the section on Free@@ D@@ b . put it all as shown in the screen photo .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look at a mirror server near you . this way the load is distributed between the computers . however , this setting will work as first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls represent the protocol 88@@ 80 as default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD data to the Free@@ D@@ b server . the first check box is not enough .
simply take the settings from your screen shot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously inter@@ mitt@@ ent pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one of the existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and code ? the author does not know , so simply try to try .
CD ; after reading the last part : cross this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you check this , then the path / folders can be specified , if only space on another drive can be created , the files will not be detected , if you do not want to make this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
to enter this as it is on the screen shot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances anything must be bl@@ inded to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a very good audio quality , even for very good hi@@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restri@@ ction of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags , if necessary , for a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in your screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this sample :
number of simultaneous WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a Multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will build mp3 files . the folder structure , which is described in the previous section , as we are comfortably up and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ D@@ b is described . the process of this section is described in this section , must be repeated for any ex@@ iting &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in Free@@ D@@ b , watch the screen shots a little differently than the data for a &amp; CD . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD , instead of removing them from the internet . comments will point out to the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this sample is to be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not been done , then the &amp; CD must now be defined in the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen shot . this only if the &amp; CD is identified as an audio CD , and it could be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then search the questions and answers to the previous post or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD was successfully picked up from Free@@ D@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window built in , and you can select the database record that your opinion is best suited to your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t select the check box for automatic query from Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) can also be selected manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , but get the data from the internet you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in an input field &apos; Update title &apos; unless you have a composition with various artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ec@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of CD .
attention : after the successful call of data from the Free@@ D@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check the contents of the CD @-@ Edit@@ ors ( e.g. if all words start with big letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags ; this option is set up on the Co@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ Settings tab ; take a look at the section &apos; Fund@@ am@@ er@@ er@@ Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the code to get more information .
simply select one entry , obviously with the style of the ex@@ iting CD ; this is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD . for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD @-@ Edit@@ ors window appears and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece will be in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected so selected . make sure all the pieces are selected , or pressed the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time .
was launched by clicking on the button selection menu , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and pursued .
click on the riders in order to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece will be read on the hard disk . the status of the program is shown in the left bottom of the window in the status line .
this error message will look if you are trying to work with a co@@ dec , which you don &apos;t have installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target file are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the mission 1 reads the first piece out , it is finished . however , we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , please contact the status message in the lower part of the window , it &apos;s now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration settings to read this behavior . the only thing that appears to be configured , is the result un@@ clear . the machine used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code ( from two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queu@@ e of the body . after the last piece is coded a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ eu@@ vre . if you &apos;re familiar with CVS , you can download a previously compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; one part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably have done it already done ...
this section is directed to people , compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running once , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . best read the step by step guide to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various map cards and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading right ? even if only the help menu was clicked on the first start of the program , no audio CD from this kind ( especially when there is no audio CD at the time of program start ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , has probably started the program already . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot add or change this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual or change . and if you read this , he has received this section , and is therefore agreed with this suggestion .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ show messages , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project operators who is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic display of each MIDI channel by pressing the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ mid .
supports the two available standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . K@@ mid determin@@ es the procedure used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , K@@ Mid starts again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows fall . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and down the button Ab@@ play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry Ab@@ play from the menu piece or push the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played in suc@@ cession ) .
once &amp; k@@ mid ; plays a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right the speed display . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar works as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu application break in the menu , then interrup@@ ting the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two types in one piece of music . some pieces use text box , others use song@@ writer and other both of them . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are to be displayed and even better : the event sty@@ p will automatically choose which a song is chosen , so you will automatically choose the Karaoke text . but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , choose from the menu settings the entries code events or song events . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these will be played in this section as you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , you first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point ... click New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying , and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set up the scope in the collection Manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to no other collection .
when leaving the application this collection is not stored . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song to the collection . it appears again the file dialogue , with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection .
when Autom@@ atically activ@@ ates the collection , a piece will be added to the active collection ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will be added to the open @-@ opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must select the collection manager , select the collection and select the song you want .
you can choose the order in which the songs are played . if you select a series from the sub@@ menu program sequence of the menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order is specified .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the Karaoke text .
to jump to a song , select the next song , next song from the menu piece or press the key arrow on the right .
to skip a song , select the button previous piece , the entry predicted piece from the menu piece or press the key arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , choose the collection to delete collection and del@@ eting on the button .
the temporary collection may not be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter if they are saved during leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General @-@ MIDI compatible . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events were translated into events that under@@ stands syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in the Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there is no programms to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece of play .
each section may only appear except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear so often as desired . requirements for this is , however , that any occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send your map file as e @-@ mail to me in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . General use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds that supports this instrument , if your keyboard is not supported ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do this , please bear the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is now a note with Patch 127 ( ri@@ fl@@ ation ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the concept drum patch of the patch , there is a different Per@@ kus@@ sion@@ ed instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one , where the sound is the pitch of the same drum ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to specify the sounds on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with PAT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ section the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form sounds on the per@@ kus@@ sions Channel . watch as an example the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to modify some channels to other channels . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply make it easy in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , you &apos;ll need to use the keyword option for this canal ! if you are trying to change the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ kus@@ sions Patch on the Per@@ kus@@ sions Channel .
the value for P@@ itch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Ratio are multiplied by the value of P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events . if so , an MIDI file sends a P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der event , it will be used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only rel@@ ayed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to get in the map file no dec@@ imal kom@@ ash .
this setting is needed , because GM prepar@@ es that a keyboard , which will play a P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some keyboards , however , try to play a bit higher up to an oc@@ tave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use an MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu settings , point MIDI settings
the canal view is a window with a whole series of Kla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these charges you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the canal view to change the instrument on a specific channel . if you have changed a tool , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to view the played sounds . select the view on the Settings menu under the Point of Channel : settings
the pace @-@ LCD displays speed to play with which a song is played . the higher the number , the larger the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to change the text , you can slow down the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played . it contains the music , the speed , &amp; etc . it can result in two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; they have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; it has happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support comp@@ iles . to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t have a desire to add all files individually .
agreed , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , activate the automatic addition to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can push the arrow keys on the left hand side by Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I have been on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file or I want to play a file , just into the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window , and select the desired file into the window by &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file , if you want to add them directly to a collection , turn the setup Automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. Zu@@ only you want to play the first file . so add the setting automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains this a MIDI file .
then join us to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank all many thanks ! if I see this songs or see the postcard , animated me , continue to program &amp; k@@ mid ; program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ as ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) was written in the third year , so I try to take some time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to record a bit of time . as hob@@ bies , I try to play MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you simply want to make me happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you are really doing a huge delight when you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / Karaoke file by a local group . if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me , but you might have contact me as I might have a file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to get money . I want to emphas@@ ize that I can only move your feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .

in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; it can also be found on his homepage , which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can also view the development along with htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can also find links to pages with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you &apos;ll have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VI@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs if you could not hear a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playing DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet completed as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there &apos;s always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when you play it .
it is possible to select the preferred links among the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to play a list of entries , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ arch@@ ie@@ w . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / , can also be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . by clicking on a name of a category , click on the menu view and select the XML content of this part .
after changing XML files , you have to select from the menu with playlist and selected either of the processing mode , or selected a different category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and Modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ verse option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will be the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically end through opening another source . this would be anno@@ ying by opening another source , however , the user can finish the application a second time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In the directory , some examples of SM@@ IL will be supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a rider for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool to de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output from m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured via manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . here is an example of like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can even be played in the playlist for YouTube in the playlist XML .
with this the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module is specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog box assignment of K@@ DE .
the kon@@ quer@@ or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is to be able to use and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
with this always a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a given M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . for example , phon@@ on will play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play of TV cards , either by using the M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs c@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV can be configured , the scanners from the configuration dialog can be used or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog is detected in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected , from which one has to be selected ( e.g. it &apos;s PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name is probably included a DVB @-@ in .
because the V@@ DR support can only use X@@ video ( probably this kind of playing of video devices under Linux ) it should also work on the first screen ( : 0.@@ 0 ) for the X server . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux server must be functional for the X server . this is why the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally they are used by KM@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , ex@@ tu@@ g , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source ,

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes a comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writer application . under Unix @-@ like systems , this is likely to be upgraded to the package &amp; tex@@ as ; &amp; t@@ et@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included . for installation the documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD can be drawn .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled pack@@ ets of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these enable an easy installation without comp@@ ile and are included on the k@@ ile ; website included .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation should be considered . if the support for this project or documentation is requested , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; website .
if you are asked to or at comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; or if extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ ite ; -@@ environment for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tail@@ or @-@ looking for this . conclu@@ sive , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities should learn the manual of Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be used directly with reading the chapter by &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is the correct way to use : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . if it is difficult to use , an av@@ ie ( English ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic nar@@ ration is that it desc@@ ending from the name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
for example , there &apos;s not only a good value to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to get there . for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. DA@@ LY , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other ID cards ( lat@@ ex ) includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with the general properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text cre@@ denti@@ ality will be specified with the command \ \ &apos; document@@ a , who begins to be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } .
the fast @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an open function for the spe@@ edy creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; there are some options for the creation of the document . there may also be some options related to document .
document classes : this is defined by the type of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , book &#91; report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scan &#93; , projector &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; , or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is set to set the string code . modern systems use the UTF @-@ 8 encoding as default . if UTF @-@ 8x , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lateral ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the additional packages available for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they use only in the check @-@ box .
articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always take part in the creation of German texts .
new users now have no wor@@ ries . it is a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the emphasis of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) : should you be seen by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless , however , it will be saved by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will be saved by the up@@ lift time and time .
with automatic adjustment of the environments is generated by entering a new command ( for example \ \ , { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for inser@@ ting the text ) and the corresponding line to the command settings ; set up in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encourage the document of the document in the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ) :
in view of the document in the structural view , the single elements can be replaced and viewed by a single click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; look for the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
one DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and other information such as the font and is besides PDF the output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices .
when using the data collection , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file with the editor is scre@@ wed and immediately clicked on the exact opposite is the exact opposite . once upon a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was clicked on , the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is spec@@ kl@@ ed .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted for project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file recovery : in this mode , the DVI ; file is executed in action @-@ held and there is no appeal by &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; after quick construction .
for viewing the editing tool , the three large selection fields should be added to the document . the first selection field is designed for fast breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the division are :
the selection field further is to be included in articles such as tags , fu@@ des , or references . the available options are :
designation : with this command , a name for a section is created , a picture or other element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection of selection ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries will be shown . for the editing of &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; these files are required . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files can be found in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name of the place will be used for the defin@@ ing of the font . it enables the font to be specified for the main text , the rules and notes .
by calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two choices for selecting : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document and bon@@ ding settings . 2 . the document can be written down by hand .
the brackets according to the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . the font is not defined at the beginning , this may also occur in the text .
once the above source code has to be compiled the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled . the easiest way to use is to use the menu building or the button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; storage automatically for storage .
if the comp@@ ile of the document fails , it should be sought after the errors . when using quick construction , it should be rest@@ art@@ ed ; it is not the case , it should also be respected .
one environment ( engl@@ ish@@ . environment ) is a text which is different from the remaining document . for example , a report with the written document shall be created , and only a few drops should be given . the command \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ &apos; { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ ing { environment } encouraged the use of the font in the street . &quot; - Hu@@ ge Hu@@ ge ) .
all actions will be covered only within the environment ( from the \ \ National { environment } to \ \ &quot; { environment } ) . there is no evidence ( number ) for the dep@@ rec@@ tions within a environment .
there are many options to increase the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . there are , for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . , these commands are added to the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Last { premature } : this command is available for the c@@ anned pressure and is long @-@ long until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { premature } or another environment . a single word in one set can be displayed with \ \ &apos; { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quotation marks with the \ \ Good { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ . { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to the code writing with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the recording language is now displayed , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once the wiz@@ ard was entered a bit text , a few adap@@ t@@ ations should be performed for the better read@@ ability of the document . at least a quote , a few places in fatty and cur@@ sive printing and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or Str@@ g E can be turned back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window will be closed .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and fun .
DVI ; is a different file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ g ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screen TVs .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as possible for the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - you can print a document by clicking on the button ( see if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar encour@@ ages the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source file was created , the conversion into the tool@@ bar can start in the tool@@ bar .
the pre@@ condition is to encourage the direct jump from the editor to the added position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding configuration for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to set up only modern under settings K@@ ile ... tools must be combined .
in order to search the pre@@ condition , the cur@@ sor is positioned in a line of the source context and close to pre @-@ related search . the jump to the respective place in the DVI ; viewer takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; have been added and to the corresponding line . for this it must be set &amp; c@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; set up as text editor ( Settings page )
if you don &apos;t want to use quick installation of the &amp; DVI ; you can &apos;t find an error , it should appear in the protocols file or in the message window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the logging file will be used in the source code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the editor you will always be able to view the errors of the error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the logging file will always appear on the error message . in order to read the error message , the error message must be clicked on and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the faulty line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as soon as clicking on the respective button in the tool@@ bar , a window will be published to choose from the document . default options are :
when selecting the empty document , a document may be re@@ written either from scratch or the assistant for quick creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
high @-@ level user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a new document , some fonts can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... Settings General .
in creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which character strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ : this string will be replaced by entering the document class . typically it will be used as follows : \ \ document@@ Class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { Article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the instructions given in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been completed :
when creating a new document , you can use your own template instead of standard equipment .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . will be a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described above .
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers and Her@@ pre@@ he@@ b@@ ens of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for Kate and Kate ; can be performed directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
to learn more about Kate and Kate ; and his compan@@ ions should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be used directly with reading the chapter by &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called for the supply of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a suitable description of almost all commands used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be found and their syntax .
double click with ge@@ ck@@ led r@@ g button to check the &amp; tex ; it means that in this way , that in this way , click \ \ per of \ \ per \ big@@ u@@ ros to be found in this way .
by pulling the text with dr@@ illed left mouse button , the selected text will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , switch parts of the source pane in the editor window .
&amp; hur@@ ry ; has the possibility to browse and highlight the different types of source tex@@ tures as well . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another colour .
many assist@@ ants can be found in addition . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . this trampoline brand is highlighted by the jump to n@@ Ã ous or last jump brand . this trampoline is also stressed , so that it will automatically be heard in the first input of a character .
the editing is probably one of the main advantages when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; product tex@@ tures were added in &amp; styles ; special commands for their selection . under Edit menu , the following commands are included in text selection :
there are a complete paragraph ( batch of rows that contain an empty line ) . this advanced importance is meant with the tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source tex@@ tures . the only in@@ significant thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the breakdown can be separated by two empty lines .
address the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a range of friction ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end of AUS@@ W@@ Ã ¤ t .
for the view of a part of the document , it can be removed from the button de@@ f . &amp; Kate ; offers the key agent C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line will be removed . &amp; ile ; offers the following commands for a quicker mood . under editing , the following commands are included :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description of Edit menu .
it has already been clear that environments will play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; for example , &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under editing environment for a very simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed right behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or within the command \ \ National { environment } , the end of the environment is inj@@ ected ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of the ambient air commands can be lost quickly , this command closes the last open environment so that the sh@@ allow environment structure will not be dist@@ orted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by brackets { ... } . under editing te@@ X group they are a few important commands to meet those from editing environment .
with this command , the cur@@ sor is produced at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the open cl@@ ammer .
with this command , the cur@@ sor is inj@@ ected at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the scre@@ ened cl@@ ammer .
if the cur@@ sor is located or behind the scre@@ ened cl@@ ammer of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of scre@@ ened groups , groups can be lost quickly . this command closes the last modified group , so that the sh@@ allow structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be dist@@ orted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy beginnings are used for the purpose of purpose . for the purpose of purpose , the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic alignment of the double beginner water@@ mark can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X .
there can also be used on specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ical or French ) and for German or French beginnings . there are also many other languages available .
at the dr@@ ink@@ age of Shift ; Regist@@ ers , a smart Z@@ eil@@ ing break . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a line breaks , but also the command \ \ item .
close within a tables -@@ environment close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a plug @-@ in line breaks off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ score pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set up under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users belong to the columns in tables -@@ um@@ bs and all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) mut@@ ually . &amp; k@@ ile ; searches &amp; k@@ ile ; if this tab@@ ulator is not able to encourage &amp; k@@ ile ; even though this tab@@ ulator is not included ; for the columns to the columns position of the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate . already offers a good source code for use , these in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , there are three different modes . all these modes are available for automatic operation modes . all these modes can be set up ... Ver@@ fully set .
at the beginning , a new environment with the command \ \ National { environment } will be &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; { environment } on an empty line ( for the text ) .
the last letter of the input key will be removed , then the last letter of the input is removed and enables you to complete the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are cre@@ denti@@ fied by selecting a command . alternatively , there is a simple jump to these positions using editing trampoline marks N@@ Ã ¤ est spring@@ board is possible and the desired parameters can be frozen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under settings c@@ ile ; set up ... c@@ ile ; possible settings to these lists are made . there can be different possible lists for the lists , and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as voters of the general language use . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the command mode is not enough for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ times , and the call of default mode will be used so often , the environments are so often used to make &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for adjustment of the environments .
when calling the purpose of use , the Men@@ Ã ¼ d Alt + Shift key space is automatically shut down and it will be released to the open environment in the environment . after that , the ambient temperature is maintained in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be completed by pushing the input key .
after this is completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogn@@ ises that it is a key environment , it will even be a first \ \ item command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under settings c@@ ile ; set up ... c@@ ile ; multiple settings are made to these lists . this mode uses the list of list of comparison mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; custom @-@ defined lists of devi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by l@@ apping character strings . as an example of a complete list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is used for example the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l which is contained in the example of the associated entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word ( code ) pres@@ enter the quantity of use or the key combination of the CTR@@ L + Alt le@@ aking paste , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large numbers are not helpful for the automatic recovery . however , it has been noted that many voters are written in a document more than once . thus , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for all written consent .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile obli@@ que . here , the sw@@ elling value for the display can be specified here .
the complete programming files are available in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode ( storage ) , Dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the dialog for graphics include graphics such as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphic formats , the sections should be considered .
PS -@@ files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for the basis and new regulations of pages . will the PDF output can be performed , so you can use the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then be converted into a PDF file .
in order to view the result of the work , you have to comp@@ ile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the process of creating comp@@ iling , creating and create view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer , such as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the additional conversion may be used by pressing Alt ; 3 , by using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and can be converted into a PS @-@ file and by using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command quick , a viewer is usually inv@@ oked after comp@@ ile . should not be used once a new window will be possible every time .
a new project will be asked about the project &apos;s new project .... In the following information , the project will be asked for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r repository .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows to manage EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed in a vertical scripts .
the API scripts are not yet developed yet and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first , it must be said that the training environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system@@ ic object ( = c@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional par@@ c@@ els . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different support to assist the user .
&amp; t@@ et@@ ex ; and &amp; textiles live ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; you may need to do with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; you may not wait to wait for someone else . you can &apos;t wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found below .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start Edit menu Edit menu . the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage and add all of the plug@@ ins included . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can input the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage place &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often , multiple people work in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship each other . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; supports the speci@@ fying of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Properties project dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user name of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member can have multiple roles in the project , such as both team manager and Sub@@ project manager .
the user can search for himself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ers who is looking for . this is done by clicking the team member from the list and press the S@@ etz@@ e button . the currently selected member ( her identi@@ fies ) will be fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
besides the overview of your team , there is another advantage through the recording of the team members : it can be created an event for information to the team manager , when something is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions performed when something specific in the project is done . an example would be the sign of the opening and closing of the project , as much as someone worked on , or a script that plays a file , or a script that will be added to a CVS , once they will be added to the project , etc . ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog . events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the address indicated in the recipient . the mailing list can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such leaders are set up .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
to enter your comments , either the editor @-@ entry can be selected from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by note text .
comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the nick@@ name of the team member ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) , which is the nick@@ name of the team member sub@@ project manager , Sub@@ project manager Sub@@ project manager , such as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and cast@@ ors are independent of large or small sp@@ elling , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the signs are invalid .
&amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages supported by DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and support web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only on &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by means of Settings Quant@@ a ... &#93; This dialogue extends over a few pages , which will be treated .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be modified . the entries are :
large / short description of tags : large / small sp@@ elling of automatically included tags . normal large / lower friction means that tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag@@ on XML files .
large / lower friction of attributes added : large / lower friction added to automatically added attributes . normal Large / lower friction means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ on XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , is optional available for the closing day , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and finish day automatically : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic transformation of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in corresponding encoding during typ@@ ing .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect various types of files . using the standard default , default conditions can be recovered .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other way than with open @-@ open files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) , however , this setting is sent out by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . however , this setting is transmitted from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup copies , so that in a power cut or crash when the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . also , a backup is made regularly , according to the set time , created .
preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or your own view ( or documentation in a cart@@ ograph@@ er ) which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings back next to the next start is useful if the user interface by changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on opinions came through each other . it complies with the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning area is used to control war@@ nings by adding war@@ nings from no more inquiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it is possible to display symbols instead of scripts , just like the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ S and the source code in divided mode .
here the par@@ ser and structural @-@ tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structural @-@ tree causes the following action , it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural building with the mouse button .
in the structural @-@ tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree to edit and how deep in a change of structural timber can be opened automatically , empty groups are found in the text , while empty groups are not found in which the current document has been found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the range of short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) will be divided into groups , each for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; s . this means that there may be a valid group for PHP , which means the if@@ se abbrevi@@ ation something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ Applications from third side , which can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most well known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for inser@@ tion of a plug @-@ in , the following should be specified :
address : the path to plugin if it is not in a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is transferred to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin does not deny the loading . only read @-@ reading parts usually refuse loading when this option is not elected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . if the plug @-@ in is not available , but it will not be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug@@ ging was completely re@@ designed . ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was adjusted , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented , which enables different implement@@ ations to plug@@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; add .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options besides the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; -@@ interface :
a view that is displayed in the contents of super@@ vised variables . appears normally in the left dock .
a view in which all gri@@ ps are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appear in the lower dock .
a view in which the output is shown ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually it appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , made , or it divi@@ des the plugin with when a project is opened when a project is opened , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger does not need to be respected .
the counter@@ part for de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the leaves according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to view a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger edition .
points out the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script and to send information about the super@@ vised variables as well as the current status is continued , when the script continues , the script will start before a debit mem@@ orandum starts , the script will start with the request .
points out the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script , without information to super@@ vis@@ ing variables and the current line number . if this is done , the execution comes further . when a debit is given , the version begins as soon as a requirement is provided .
the de@@ bu@@ gger guides the next statement in the script without entering the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger guides the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and includes errors .
points out the de@@ bu@@ gger to over@@ pass the order and go to the next so as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog you can set a variable or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how to customize &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; can be adapted to your needs and as you are &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
document type E@@ diti@@ er@@ pack@@ ets ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; they enable &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; ability to make support &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; your simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the text and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars ( above the editing window ) , insert text and instructions faster into a document as a user ever could .
DT@@ EP ; s can be used hanging ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details for conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; DT@@ EP .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) will define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars enable a quick inser@@ tion of tags to a document without a threat of writing .
tag folders are nothing but folders . you only contain the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the writing language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and borders will be explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in one document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains only nothing else .
the tags type is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the Tag@@ Type Class only . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the Type Method only . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( Family 1 )
does a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; Tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only be used once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attributes . additionally , it contains further tags that will describe how this attribute is to appear &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
releases the source code used for filling the attributes in tag editors and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name inside &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method@@ ology name . the arguments that will be handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur only once . it is a single element type element .
specify the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog . this day can only occur every attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that make a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ declar@@ ations start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly edited and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but respect &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files is the tools dialog above in the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . at present the review will only be performed at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ;
in the following example , for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atic day .
in the following example , for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP will be described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; string _ name &quot; type = &quot; string _ name &quot; type = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is equally simple , and there is one editor that can be reached via DT@@ D . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for one out of a list selectable &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it should be created for a new &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
a action can be set with Settings Ac@@ tions ... click to Create new action to the same dialog :
&quot; &quot; &quot; this action assigned to the button . with clicking on the user button one button can be assigned a button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current button is removable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be typ@@ ed in the detector settings and in execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change or use the document ( or parts of the document ) , but are the quick@@ start -@@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ dir variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Quant@@ a / scripts / Quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document it will be file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text will be used to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; the external script is used .
the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods can use a script input from &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; to default . in the selection box input can be specified to specify what to default . options are :
selected text : the selected field of document will be sent to the script . the % input variable normally makes sense with this setting .
accordingly input can also be re@@ directed to the output issue . there are two types of issue : normal edition , written down to the default output . it may be specified when the default output is to be done by selecting the select box output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in this case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
complete all the necessary fields and add them to the suitable tool bar .
complete all and , if the tag attributes and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; tag &quot; call , if available , so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly icon . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
for creating a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graph further programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol is not only helps to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP .
with regard to that the day start , I have chosen to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be interpreted as a symbol ) , or should at least an message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; it is ready to add a message to the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be linked to the action . this happens through the menu with Settings Ac@@ tions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; ) and S@@ election of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press him .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button button and continue to continue with other tags , so there are or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool bar supplement or it should be adjusted for a better overview by some Tren@@ to . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick possibility to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I &apos;ll choose it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the divi@@ ders do not support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols to make sure everything works .
secure in the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder but your tool@@ bar should be stored in the right folder , so that their tool bar ( s ) will be loaded , if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ation language , which you like a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then , you have to let the doc@@ r@@ c file . first part we will leave you , the second we treat here .
# K@@ DE Configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # 1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1
the section defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in PHP &amp; PHP ; documentation is :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting started , # Language Reference Table = Basic syntax = Basic syntax = Basic syntax = basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic synchron@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting started and Language Reference . this shows that it is a sub@@ folder in tree with private content . there is no known limit for chess sets ( except the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent with the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; files will be shown ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ files are replaced .
the section section is the section of doc@@ r@@ c file , which is to be displayed in the context of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP , documentation for the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array parameter is to be displayed . there are only two types of entries here . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connecting lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file doc@@ r@@ c and save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Quant@@ a / doc / $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / Post@@ a / doc / $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / accommodation / doc / accommodation / doc / accommodation / doc / accommodation / doc / accommodation / doc / accommodation / doc / Quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / Post@@ a / doc / Visa / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / accommodation for local or global use . then create a folder in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you &apos;re sure that these good and it are worth shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to use the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; -@@ organization . they will not be rich , but are proud to have worked with the best web developer platform .
with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise to whom are sent . at different places we send an email , tool@@ bar tool with email , the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all the others &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can be reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and usable for the publication , for what it is guaranteed to use a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key , both for our team as well as for later users .
when charging , you are asked for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have more keys . in the dialog new resource , the input fields must remain empty ) and then click OK to start the up@@ loading .
the upload can upload the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , and upload tool@@ bars from files and folders in templates and scripts in the context menu .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the Sig@@ nific@@ ation . in case of problems , and it may be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the statement of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; but it can be time consuming , because hundreds of tag files can be required in tag@@ XML format . it gives the simpler way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into an DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . choose the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string that in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / Lo@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; by converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and fully benefits from &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; this chapter is to bring to them perfectly with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; the working range is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . by tool@@ bars , it is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators to secure different materials , actions and patterns in global tree , which can be provided in any user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so it can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . all elements are used in the folder @-@ tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the buil@@ ders , the container walls , with information and tool@@ bars . please suggest in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click the map guide with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , re@@ load , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the Edit@@ or@@ tic area lead to another context menu regarding the document@@ ing contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / insert ) , editing below the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file , if the character string is described below the mouse po@@ inter .
at the top end of the Edit@@ or@@ window are the tool bar . currently , &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional is shown as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are adapted to the new features and therefore associated user needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of tool bar is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then you can insert the data for this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tag , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then you can fill the data for this just one day , then you can fill the data for this just one day ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate and cut into the information &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate and ro@@ am . in the presentation with cart@@ oon@@ ists are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation sites .
project Management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; prepar@@ es . this view displays all files in the project with right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or delete the files from memory medium can be performed using the displayed text menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which it is used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; the category depends on the relevant user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates can be found in this category .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of the integration in global , local and project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can check the information available to a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script can start , edit or send us using email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on the element of an element , the cur@@ sor is opened to the position of the element . by Right -@@ clicking a element , a list of commands can be opened in terms of navigation and recording of the tree .
this tree appears under the other buil@@ ders . with it , man@@ quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . it enables the contents of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation for the web @-@ technology for your development . you can create a pre@@ set documentation for &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; you can create your own documentation , and add a folder doc to a project can edit project specific documentation .
by default &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; two boards at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this map guide displays information on each in Quantum a running script . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this map guide displays all error in the current document . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are run out , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate bar of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar containing e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive ; they can save them in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; it has auto@@ conf a number of options to get to the configure script . in order to understand a complete list of options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems at starting &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool designed for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
while effort , the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us started to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us would be ; now , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; now quite far in the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ize , then should &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; it should be &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; it should be the suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to the above mentioned claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; so to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; allows the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ painted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , the automation is possible almost every task . by using self @-@ painted actions , they can feel &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; ( more you can find it in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was developed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Quant@@ a ( either these URL in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; is currently being developed and super@@ vised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not taken out , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ set folder , only an error is reported .
converts for inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there is a special sign to &amp; HTML , so that it will display correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as a form .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL , which is the correct way for inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
switch the block selection or out . that allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
searches a string or regular expression in selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or S@@ ed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
exit and switch off the problem repor@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; main repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you move to the structural @-@ tree .
displays the symbol of the main window from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ mark with a mouse click .
if book@@ marks in the current file , they will be published in the menu with entries previous or next , depending on the cur@@ s@@ ors position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents will be group@@ ed in the menu following the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the repository for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation options depend on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded additional inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; project manages . chapter &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; projects can be explained in the details .
downloads a project tool bar . they are stored in the project / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be added by means of settings . you will need to store additional tool@@ bars and you will be asked if you want to save the tool bar .
removes a tool bar from the field . you do not delete it from the disk . if you don &apos;t have saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send their own tool bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; team , that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; who made you or anything else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; own problem format .
load / ref@@ resh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; to ren@@ ew themselves without the full &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this global is not available , and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder does not fail .
this menu includes a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ men@@ ues .
activated or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . this is currently only working with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ tion by means of tool bar , if this day does not contra@@ di@@ ct the rules .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins below the top listed menu will be listed . click on it . click on a activated plug@@ ins de@@ activated .
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available herr@@ ing evaluations depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
choose type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to the developer . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D using the external application .
immediate change between the different types of the user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries you may need or cause un@@ pleasant graphics . it is recommended that the card mode is , or the screen mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition this menu for each open sub@@ window contains an entry . with selection of a request , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; main window on or out .
the changes in this dialog influence any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
addresses the behavior of the Edit@@ or@@ window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you &apos;ll find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or add which you can change .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled in the best from above to bottom , as after completing the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . in the input of name file the file will be completed automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has saved the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository .
here is the server address of the machine where you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings of the selected protocol can be used . depending on the remote machine setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this allows you to include files from the local file system into the project . several files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . for ser@@ ver@@ ing scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
act @-@ up , if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be connected . if a project started ane@@ w , not an@@ h@@ aken .
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to credit .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . one can select the desired files by An@@ h@@ aken or , by removing the bun@@ ny , cl@@ utter from the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings which can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can upload or upload using the project Properties in the menu pane or using the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which can be re@@ loc@@ alized in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mentary option to the above , also listed files which are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded during opening the project , can be read more about project views .
the de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected with this . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the button options . in addition , de@@ bug@@ ging is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a view for the content of the server for each profile , by showing a separate building view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the Event configuration , one can switch off event action and add these actions , change or delete these actions , if a previously specified event happens , such as the sick@@ les of a file . see in the details .
by default &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not currently influence .
in order to open a different project , choose Project ... from the Project Project or the Symbol Project will open from the tool@@ bar . the Project Project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save any changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; changed files happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
please do the folder , however , to open the entries opening and open with ... in the right mouse click menu menu :
several profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information on the site of the uploaded files .
allows the removal of current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be bl@@ inded to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in the core memory and password . this possibility is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk option is not found in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; can be uploaded to various servers and uploaded to a project ( or parts of the project ) to various servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a full qualified domain name or an IP address work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed k@@ io sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this doesn &apos;t have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate any service on the usual port .
depending on your ang@@ st wave , this is either a time saving function or a danger . use them according to your discre@@ tion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simply do@@ cking the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via att@@ itudes tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; to your own work@@ ings .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; best used by the tool@@ bar . use and add @-@ out materials will be dealt with in the section addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols are set to be adjusted in the tool@@ bar ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new tool@@ bar can be adjusted , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be specified on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries to remove and action are displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and settings can be set .. .
templates are in essential documentation , code schn@@ itz@@ el and files to the link . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; used templates basically like a usual file system with expan@@ sive organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory in the pad@@ dock . templates have in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you need for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template prior to use .
bin@@ aries is all that is not pure text . it can be added any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . some examples are displayed in documents under global templates ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . more information about the template is available .
documents can be created by any text documentation . on the basis of this templates , you can create a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate ways to be efficiently . some examples may be found in the pre@@ ventive room under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
this kind of templates is useful , if not a new document needed on a template but the same text area to be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a detailed menu system to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . see some examples in the pre@@ ventive room under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
as the name says , these templates for all websites are used as templates . they are a collection of different documents which can be combined in a folder tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure as desired ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File as a template as your local template ...
once this is done , note that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the project room under project templates .
select text in your document and click here to save selection as local / project templates . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and dra@@ gging on the template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be downloaded in a pre@@ set folder , such as drag and drop or inser@@ ting through the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
one can select a folder right in the file tree or in the project files building man@@ view , select a name for the template and secure a name for the template , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
project templates enable a very targeted way @-@ oriented approach . you can create header lines and foot@@ er , or dynam@@ ically , create files , or link them with them . in addition , you can create some things using using templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the sub@@ structure in the sub@@ window templates are based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder you can click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu features . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden , as soon as ter@@ ter@@ ous attributes is bent .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for everything except the stem files . if a master folder would be set off , it would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , it is probably in a master folder .
allows four or recre@@ ated text for templates in this folder . this could be general header lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p a folder with special header lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation with matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , we have a context menu ( showing right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor that are accessible via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source pane in two parts : the code editor and the V@@ PL code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it is a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit it and when needed for source code editing in the V@@ PL ; Editor is visible in the sourc@@ ec@@ ode .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it shows a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ roid of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; it is still necessary to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; it is still no plans to modify this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time , the cur@@ sor is active in both the source code and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously runs . with pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the button push the active cur@@ sor from a window to the other , where the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings Quant@@ a .... In addition , you can choose between synchron@@ ization to one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small range for fast calcul@@ ator and a wide range for slow PC .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the documentation of invisible tags in working with V@@ PL ; it is also called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . that is to change the suspension of the wag@@ ging code . that can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ Elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list enables the change of the contents to e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword ke@@ yr@@ t@@ 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of desig@@ ning the design of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules to the list below the list or delete a change over the list of met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of cur@@ s@@ ors is like in a text processing , because of the arrows , possible . the cur@@ sor is pec@@ uli@@ ar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or remo@@ ver .
the inser@@ tion of tags will be made in the same way over the tool@@ bars , such as in the source code editor , which is already existing in the source code , e.g. if an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed every other re @-@ anchor day .
some tool@@ bars like the tables @-@ assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists have to be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining sty@@ liz@@ ed styles . in contrast to other programs , search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style can be followed .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need to comp@@ ile it out except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already existing in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determin@@ es the full path from a file name without sc@@ ou@@ ting . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded sty@@ liz@@ er file named x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is used for example a sty@@ list@@ ic file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a demonstration called QNA@@ ME or a specified Mod@@ us@@ name is checked . &amp; eg ; template is right with any QNAP template containing the character template .

there are many graphic tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the merge was very complicated because there has been a lot of changes at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of changes in the same file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result was a lot of conflicts in the same file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had been changed within these lines . and there was no indications in the places where maybe only the retro@@ fit had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could mark differences within a row and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions have been added later .
if you want to compare text quickly , just copy it to the clip@@ board and add it to one of the comparison window .
a function that made much work was the compar@@ isons and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
3 @-@ way merge is also supported . this is useful when two persons work independently in one piece of co@@ de work and make changes . the interaction editor allows you to edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the photo picture shows three qu@@ ell @-@ files when using :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and merge folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and en@@ sembles the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble if nobody changes the retro@@ fit ) .
if a file is equal , and the others differ in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders then you can complete the typ@@ ing work by using only the fil@@ ename of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 ( Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 @-@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o target folder
open @-@ dialog gives the manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or the elect of a last opened file in the list box . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file when you leave the record for C , the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , then select the default or merge folders . if you select a file , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
when merge is crossed , the input field is active for the target and it is not necessarily required to specify an output file . you can finish this step later when saving .
the set button will open a dialog with Settings . here you can specify Options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board to the active compar@@ ative window . in the open dialog you don &apos;t need to select files , simply connect the dialog .
you can also drag and lay down : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall through a comparison window .
what idea is behind ? it contains a file for example several similar functions . if you want to figure out what is similar to these functions , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to compare two corresponding files , they would just copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : you can &apos;t find out anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the antenn@@ as of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and inser@@ tion of text into another program as cut@@ off and inser@@ tion ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Each Info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , let the mouse rest a while on line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees the color that file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) .
links next to the text is the summar@@ izing column . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . with some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only in character and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare items relevant . )
the vertical line , which separates the summar@@ izing column from the text , where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks is enabled , the line is scored on broken lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ ative windows ) also has an Info @-@ line with the inscription : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you have already processed the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use buttons to be closest / un@@ resolved conflict to find even remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ative windows are used , every difference is to be replaced manually in the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group &apos;s column in all windows is marked , and the first line of the group will be shown . this group will then be shown in the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background colour for current area and the left appears on a black bar .
sometimes , through the automatic merge or through manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; it &apos;s only a plac@@ eholder for the case , that you may change your mind and perhaps another source code . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking which you may copy and add it elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge operation ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignore or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the images , but you can also use the keyboard , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys , right , end , string early and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ b@@ as can also be used by other programs . if you can also navigate to the navig@@ ating column , you can also click navig@@ ating .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with insert button , you can switch between plug @-@ and over@@ write mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as described in the section merge and editing the output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate to the next / last / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ pictured down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ pictured down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ pictured down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict , even after manual release , must be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflict .
in order to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you &apos;ll need to automatically copy the copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is enabled , automatically copied to clip@@ board and remove manual copying . be careful with this option but if you could acci@@ dentally write the content of the clip@@ board .
line versions are stored according to the underlying operating system . uni@@ x variants use a line @-@ in symbols \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use line @-@ in line \ \ r \ . K@@ ON@@ 3 does not retain the line @-@ files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not with binary files .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start . ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you shouldn &apos;t use them . )
if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the selected script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered to the button default settings automatically an un@@ regulated color .
when this option is enabled , the tab button inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual to the clip@@ board then .
you can select which line type you prefer . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
at the same of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . even when merge , white signs will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon back@@ drop &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then they could only store a line @-@ in &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is enabled , however , this option will be disabled . during the merge , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis figures and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) will be ignored . however , the differences will be displayed nevertheless , but they are treated as white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively search for smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective with complex and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic @-@ forward mode , this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ resolved conflict is inj@@ ected .
automatically trig@@ gers all conflicts in white characters by selecting the selected file as a source . ( default is useful if white characters occur in many files , if you only need to ignore the functions W@@ ähle A / B / C for all un@@ el@@ dest white conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are enabled or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are covered in Chapter to scan folders and merge a merge . see for details on documentation to compare and merge tracking .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be the suff@@ ix .@@ original version . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and rest@@ art . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available because the language is defined globally through the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you use this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
in the selection fields for coding , a short notice , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and for you are pure inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
when you edit a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could not work 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre@@ processing warrant can only be set with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
switch off this to supp@@ ress differences of changes in white characters in text or consider@@ ations . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options may ignore or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + comments enabled . )
this choice is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences between two of three files will be shown . however , you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . by selecting A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C , C or B &amp; lt ; C is displayed next to the normal or second column @-@ column with the information required .
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window by side or above each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide if you &apos;re using only two files . a simple click will work when using only two files . ( if this function is used to run the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it becomes visible to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command itself is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that is exactly your requirements . for example , you can extract this function , e.g. for release distur@@ bing parts or to correct inser@@ tion .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when using the line processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that is exactly your requirements . each input line must have an associated output line .
the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when enabling the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not wish to program this . the good news is , however , that in most cases S@@ ed or per@@ l are sufficient .
in this context , use this pre@@ set command for Z@@ eil@@ ing to convert the input in upper@@ case letters : S@@ ed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; s text string to the found text . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other ver@@ sion@@ ing systems use a few key words to include files generated automatically ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ st@@ itution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \
while you experiment with S@@ ed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing warrant for Z@@ eil@@ a . S@@ ed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and any hits will be replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple tasks at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements from each other . example :
instead of S@@ ed you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ e -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; Ho@@ wever , some details are different from per@@ l . where S@@ ed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ m@@ um are retained for display and merge . further operations change only the data , which sees line @-@ equal al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t miss certain differences .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and interact with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders can be recur@@ sively and combined .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adapt the suggestion before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate the interaction , showing the sim@@ ulated changes , without being able to accomplish ,
... leads to selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files . you only need to specify folder on command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder is used as a base . if no target folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will not start to run the merge , select the menu entry or press F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
during the read of the folder you will inform a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the file scanning , only the files are listed below .
if the scanning of the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and every folder used during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click .
the folder structure is normally folded together . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu includes two functions , and all sub@@ directories can open up with which you can open all folders .
if you double click on a file , the file will start immediately and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action can not be selected automatically . if the merge is launched , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns above .
in case of identical entries the colour is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if you are identical to the entire content . then folder is the same color . during folders the age is significantly lower for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colours of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such bad objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such bad objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders are specified . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : mer@@ ging and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as visible fil@@ ename for the output file only B ; copied directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders can be merged and select the new file instead of merge ( un@@ sure ) , then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. As long as such mistakes are not removed , the merge cannot be started .
during the merge , a file is executed after the other . a status column indicates that when the merge has been successfully , and when the merge is complete , you should take a final review and see if the status is fine everywhere .
if in setup dialog , the file compar@@ ative analysis is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these include the number of un@@ mol@@ ars , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( column for dissolved conflicts is only shown if three folders can be compared or merged . )
you can either result in either selected entry ( file or od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( even in all under@@ ord@@ ings ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not have a target folder , then the three @-@ folder merge mode is used as target , when the two @-@ folder merge is used as target and when synchron@@ ize , A and / or B is used as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target file , even in the folder structure , there are some options that could be ski@@ pped in order to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to bring back all the entries : select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to carry out only the current entry : choose action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if by contra@@ dic@@ tory data types still exist , a message appears to be found on the defective elements . they can then select a valid action .
if you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options , ejac@@ ulating and break .
select Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without which really changes will be made . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual interference is necessary ( combined with a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( see the picture photo ) .
if you are ready with a file , select again directory entry / continue , or press F@@ 7 . if you are not saved , an appropriate dialogue will appear . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; put on a mistake , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you have the chance to select a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before using the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , you &apos;ll notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and execute all entries not again . even if the merge action has been taken or not saved , these entries will be performed once again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files which are shown on the specified pattern will be shown in the element @-@ tree . separ@@ ating the pattern with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is not to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern will not be shown in the element @-@ tree . it can use more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern will not be shown in the element @-@ tree . it can use more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files which will also be ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ or . )
in some fil@@ esystem files , files have a default attribute . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled by default .
with links to files : when the option is shut down , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to the links . this is disabled by default .
in the links to the folder : if the option is switched off , the links will be compared and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; no link to a folder that may result in itself would lead to an end loop and de@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is switched off in default .
does a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics of statistics . ( the number of dissolved , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when used to files , which contain no text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster , just compare the change date and the file size . please use a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to confi@@ dential exp@@ ir@@ ation date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if the copying date is lost . please use caution when copying the amend@@ ment date . please be careful with caution . this option is under default .
activ@@ ating synchron@@ izing mode when two folders can be compared and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals are identical to the merge . also , the results from merge files are stored in both folders . this option is displayed in default .
if there are differences , it is suggested to copying the newer file as action . ( this is considered un@@ safe because the other file is not changed too . ) This option is displayed in default .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , the original version will be renamed . if an old backup file is already deleted , it will also be deleted without another backup . this will also refer to the normal association of individual files , not only the merge whole folder . this option is enabled by default .
normally the folders @-@ merge pane stays visible with the mouse button . if you don &apos;t like that , you can switch off the folder directory in the window menu , and switch to switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two opinions .
probably , you prefer to compare a file simply by double click . however , in the directory menu , you can use a single file directly , but if you save the result , the status will be done directly , and the file will not run once again when you run the folder .
this status is however lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way , you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers .
the first command line represents a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
one URL has another syntax for local files and folders . a few things should be observed :
a path can be relatively poor . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to process author@@ ization or change date . therefore , remove the per@@ missions or modification of the original . ( note the option confi@@ dential . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of purpose is to start in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP first starts to launch the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3 from the context menu .
normally needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files , however , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if the input file is used in unified format . then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch is to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that it does not work if none of the original files exists . in addition , it is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ et comp@@ resses ) is already available . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it may lead to the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers that have gone or so will go .
you have compiled the program from sources , and the configure script probably does not have the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find further information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be regarded as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is considered not identical . if the lines is next to any other , this is co@@ operated but this is co@@ operated .
the editor is noted for each difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this important information is simply lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a file format which could store this information .
the effort for this has been too large so far . you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly missing ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does it mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use many colors for emphas@@ ise differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .

cut@@ out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copy to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . inser@@ tion ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaced the current marking .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to re@@ locate the folder with the function update . )
there are only entries to show the differences . this also causes the identical files in conjunction with the target folder . if the target file does not already contain these files , it will not be modified in a later program version . ) This option is displayed in default .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the selected window , the lines will be attached to the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already available ) , they will be back by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . understanding differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .

the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has been clicked only the symbol and the name of the application as well as the name of the application as well as the entries , maxim@@ ize , desktop and commands .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of desktop . appears only when clicking on a application .
send the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only when clicking on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ amp ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
cross this field makes the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . display the numbers of virtual working areas . it is out@@ lined with the name and enter the names with ord@@ inal numbers , eg . 1 . desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is shown as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . displayed .
if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as a small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to make their selection .
here is selected the view of the program window . simple and easily displays the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very quick systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ amp ; -@@ main window can be determined : classic &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n rack , all virtual working areas appear in some other platforms ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual working areas appear in a vertical range , which is very good for the presentation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying the windows as symbols or with its content . besides , it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; set up the switch from Swit@@ ches ... lets the dialog appear .
at the moment , this can not be changed in dialog settings , but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t need to register as root or turn to your system administrator . in this file , you have to assign the key to wind@@ ow@@ transpar@@ ent@@ mode and assign a value to this file .
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE base package .

&amp; k@@ mag ; it &apos;s a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ like ; you can read a part of the screen . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designer and people with a vision attachment . this documentation is supposed to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded by new features . it is optimized for use on powerful computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ bit , a window appears as pictured above . the main window of the screen appears . in the following , this window is displayed as the magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is displayed as an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection box .
in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the cur@@ sor as a mobile L@@ upe . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ like ; you can showing a selected image window in the screen window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse button on the screen ( eg ; on the left side ) .
if you want to avoid the cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , please note that &amp; k@@ mag . please note that &amp; k@@ mag is not able to recognize the form of the mouse button . this is always the default k@@ not ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse po@@ inter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your needs . you can move it to the arrow keys and change its size . this can be done in the following manner :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the content of the magni@@ fying window and move it with the arrow keys .
if you add the &amp; Shift ; key or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the drop @-@ down menu .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop window remains set and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the larger image directly to the printer , to copy them into the clip@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . the stops of updating the needed CPU time against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , low , medium , high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection window will appear . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your filed short commands to store files , opening a new window , print , Ne@@ ul@@ ls ( with the button document re@@ load in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and Ver@@ c@@ tors &amp; etc . ;
I also know as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen pump . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a field of screen to view the clari@@ fying in a newspaper or a photo . this application is intended for various people of use : from research or artist to web designer or se@@ er .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same spot once the cur@@ sor is a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the Rep@@ et@@ itive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and to whom each mouse click pain . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain which is created when clicking the mouse , and helps you use pain without pain . unfortunately , suffer from pain that related to your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to produce it even once : if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by moving the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic aid supplies , the result may vary for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click when you break the movement short .
if the intelligent move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break , after pressing the mouse button , move it until the end of the mouse . in this way , you can drag the drag by pressing the mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this crime @-@ time must be stopped after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click a mouse click .
is smart shi@@ fting is enabled , the time set shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is set . here the time is set , the mouse button is waiting , before it leaves the mouse again , if there is no charge of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; This function is activated by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow move by clicking on the left and back . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can go &amp; k@@ de ; to sh@@ orten the reaction time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the rider General . there is a push @-@ in sound system , which you can set on a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; with every start@@ up of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; please refer to the respective documentation to find out how you launch a program automatically .
if all settings are set back to the values , while opening the dialog , you have already pushed the button to turn it down , the settings will turn back to the final pressures .
the best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent move you should initially be switched off . if you want to get used to the automatic click , you can later take the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to decrease the response time of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on digits in the Brow@@ ser@@ window that do not display a link , do not allow the mouse to park in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse .
first , you need to remove the mouse h@@ emisph@@ ere . as it happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be quickly clear when you see the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have the ball removed , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the Loch@@ es where the ball was used . dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ p easily with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re just a shift in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation is no longer able to end the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click . herein , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset ; reset and you can work as usual .
problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and establ@@ ishes the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want to place it . but if you do not want to make a mouse on a neutral field of mind . safe zones for the mouse po@@ inter and eg . safe zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bar and the titles of windows .
I try to work with smart shi@@ fting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent move is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time to copy it in this way . it is very likely to copy it to the clip@@ board and move it again , if you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . but there will probably be problems with them . here are some advice :
do not use the intelligent move , if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click on the one end of the text area a mouse click and hold down the Shift key , while you move the mouse to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will be any time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the Mau@@ button starts playing a sound like a mouse click . then you can use the intelligent move without the audi@@ ble mouse click here . however , it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be installed on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse is only available if the system features a sound card and speaker and has been set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; operated by the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor briefly . this program has been designed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and those of the bri@@ dal vert@@ eb@@ rates are processed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process before the mouse button will start . in this way the drag and drop is carried out with the mouse .

with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; I can let dum@@ b users let the computer talk for themselves . users can choose from a list with the talk of talk , which should be spoken .
the first page of the Assist@@ ants ( left screen photo ) will give you the order that later is used for the language edition of text . more details will be found in the description of the setup dial@@ ogs .
on the second side , select the standard text pass@@ able book . choose from the passages , often used text passages , without having to typ@@ ing them . the passages may naturally be processed .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) determine the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can easily spell the words of the individual words with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; it is clear and contains essentially a input field for the keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white field in the screen photo ) and a dec@@ lining of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; you can enter the pro@@ positions you can hear in the input field , which you want to hear . any spoken pack is attached to the cache memory . you can select from it phrases you want to speak .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two maps , speech output and settings , the side of Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field of the card language , you specify the command to enter the language generator . in the drop down under the input field , specify the string code , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is unchanged as default to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to the voice output from your language generator depends on this command you will find in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this will be found in App@@ endi@@ x .
with the kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service , &amp; k@@ mouth is to pass as the first try to pass the text on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a stand@@ alone interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is reasonable even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
by selecting a text passage , select which action through the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text pass@@ age@@ book or in the bar for Text@@ pass@@ ag@@ enb@@ ücher .
with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text passage is inserted directly and in addition added in the storage space . the selected text passage will only be entered into the input field first .
with the second selection box close the editing window for text pass@@ age@@ able file , you can specify if the text pass@@ age@@ book can be automatically stored when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text pass@@ age@@ able book , the book is stored . if you disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ age@@ book will not be saved . choose &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ age@@ book is to be stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction . in the main window alongside the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this sel@@ ective field , you can select the currently used dictionary to wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction .
with buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books , or export them into a file . below the list , you can adjust the name and in the selection box .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ not ; documentation is reading the number of individual words . in addition , you can easily compare the word list with a Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert it correctly in the new dictionary .
with this option , you can summar@@ ize the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which words are gathered together , and how they are weigh@@ ted .
with this option you put a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re@@ inst@@ ated words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary during the time .
the main section of the window to processing text pass@@ ag@@ rams is shared . in the upper part , the passages are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard code . if you have a text pass@@ age@@ book , you can only change its name .
you can add actions such as new passages or books or delete selected texts and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pass@@ codes or passages can be changed using the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry date is used .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry date is used .
the active movement is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected movements of the exp@@ iry date .
if this menu entry is crossed , a different tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed right under the menu bar . by clicking the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with reference about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not checked , this status bar is bl@@ inded .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for passages with entries is displayed right under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have the command for the voice @-@ over@@ s right or not fully entered . open settings and specify the command for voice @-@ over@@ s . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthesis for more details . )
the Festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival .
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java . currently he supports the English language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and get back without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the device of speech output is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / fre@@ et . the voice output is then possible with one of the three command samples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application from Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ ars into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option will be enabled as standard input .
the voice @-@ d@@ us@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further speech service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ over@@ s systems .
since the voice can only be used in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use K@@ TT@@ SD language service which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that cannot speak with the people who cannot speak , text by the calcul@@ ator . it is saved a list of already reported pro@@ positions that the user can always be re@@ turn@@ able .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on your computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either the URL to the address bar of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or run k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is made of modules of existing service , which allows you to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it presents a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programmer is ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . also users offer interesting options .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications is embedded .
the speech output is performed via the speech ic@@ kers program , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows creation of voice spending on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ dbus ; program program .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; speech Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list via htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ .com / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use program speech @-@ party software to install and set correctly . see also
on the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or so long , no speakers are set up , the map card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map image is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer various languages and voices , so also different versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should also set up a speaker because you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , because the speed protocol is otherwise used .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printers for the same printer .
if you click on the card card speakers at kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the map image will be displayed , then automatically , if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and yet there is no speakers .
all the fully furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred actors appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to remove the actors from the list .
with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the performer in the list a line further down . the sequence of speakers in the list also determin@@ es their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and Girl voice .
if you click here , the new actors appears on the map card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can check &amp; kt@@ ts . go back to the card information , and check if the voice output is enabled , so the T@@ TS service is off &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; please click on the map assign@@ ments to create and manage text contracts . see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can open the voice command of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card to open this map card . here you can set some general options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this is successful in this start , and you can create text orders , and you can pre @-@ read text applications . see the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is attached and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the previous reading is complete .
with buttons in this row , you can start text up , cancel , stop and record .
with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in &amp; k@@ de ; you can read or open a text file to the pre@@ fix . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the ticket orders will only be shown if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card box and enable voice output to enable speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , to read the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can check the text of the displayed website . check out the text that should be read and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ vol@@ tages and other invisible stamps is also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can proceed to the text editor . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text , which should be read in the main menu , and then select the language output .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ;
K@@ not@@ ch is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will notify you of specified events . you can also read the text of this news by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different kinds of messages . for example , you can be notified if you occur in an IR@@ C channel , where your nick@@ name comes . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C @-@ news text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ ebook , appears a menu entry in the Settings menu of this program . here are possible settings for K@@ not@@ ations according to the application .
filter to draw a string offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that e @-@ mail sent , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since this in most cases can be accepted as provided .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in fil@@ tering , text will be edited , before it is sent to the program speech ic@@ kers . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false @-@ spoken words or short@@ cuts , or to handle certain defects of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the work@@ ings of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders in . if the output of the screen reader is read , the received orders will continue .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the warning .
News have the next post . a message interrup@@ ts the text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that use news . while you &amp; eg . a long text on a website can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you just enter the room . &amp; k@@ not ; alerts are also news . read this .
the rest are simple text s@@ lugg@@ ish . each order , which you use of the card map , is a text contract . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses text applications . text contracts are intended for the output longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are placed in queu@@ es , except the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application is sending a screen @-@ reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre@@ read , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first , you must know that filters can never be applied to the issue of Screen Re@@ duc@@ tors . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text applications as well as &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filters work the text and give it to the next filter . at the time there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , we can add further types of filters .
Anim@@ ator replace parts of a text by other text . the inser@@ tion parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; with pre@@ defined feature of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; K@@ Mail ; in a better under@@ stand@@ able form enable .
&amp; XML ; - Conver@@ ting a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaking boxes , you can send orders to the content of the text , or depending on the program , send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have a female voice , you can read the text by K@@ DE messages about it . let &apos;s read about it .
each of these different filters has been applied , according to which it is applied to a voice @-@ over@@ s . if the filter has not found its rules , the text remains unchanged at the next filters .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification of &amp; kt@@ ts ; send it by all activated filters , which have been set up on the page below . the processing is made in the sequence from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filter . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are drawn up from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be displayed on the below steps below .
for setting strings filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a compar@@ ative pattern . this pattern will be exchanged in the text , then the text against the associated spare text will be replaced by comparison .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you can select only from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter re@@ sembles the text with the string chains in column and replaces him in accordance with the string from the column . the list is listed in the displayed sequence from above to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file that you can save or delete a list from a file , entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if the speaker is registered here , the filter is only applied , if the speaker for the text order is one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages . click the button to hold the &amp; C@@ trl ; key .
if a value is listed here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can input multiple programs separately through Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , mail
you will receive the application @-@ ID running programs with the program q@@ dbus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers need to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ dbus ; the applic@@ ant ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 may only be copied .
the string filter filter is only applied to the text if all conditions associated with an entry in the box Apply filter if any input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the string fix@@ ture filter does not use regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no guide to write regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; you can call it in the dial@@ ogs and edit it as help to merge this expres@@ sions . select &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions you find in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er translate and XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such form@@ ations . it can only be installed on your system only .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also enough .
for example , you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is set up on a particular speaker , or have a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can define that texts by mail from a female voice should be read .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; an essay on the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is presented by the speaker &apos;s attributes that select the program on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the features of the speaker card speakers are selected , you can over@@ write the selected actors .
if a value is listed here , the filter is applied , if the text has the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions , you can call this with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the desired language conditions set here . when the lyrics ful@@ fills the filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements on the right . click on the button to view the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or download or delete all your settings .
the microphone selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Apply filter if you need to register at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language edition API by &amp; k@@ de ; for both AP@@ Is , you can find on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice @-@ values via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d programme on the object K@@ Speech .
here is text of text to read and option a language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are still more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you will
open two &amp; console windows . start a window in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the above language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have installed the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ um@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival pages are not read .
due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that you don &apos;t have to do this voice at all . so , make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and can be found through the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , giving all pro@@ positions or just che@@ w@@ ob@@ bles . what can I do against it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure the option of animation is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be solved by a string fix@@ ture filter . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the list of the above languages can be incomplete or dep@@ rec@@ ated . ignore the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ ci@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you want to expand other syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , use the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and XML ; conversion filters is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of c@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; speech @-@ qui@@ ver . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source texts by &amp; kt@@ ts ; go out from the source text for k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility or have downloaded and install the software currently created with Tar@@ ball , and install the program with following commands :
before you check &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if speech @-@ c@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer correctly . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the installation of speech @-@ f@@ cher is not possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text will be dismant@@ led in individual sentences . the user can leave a pro@@ positi@@ onal or a full purpose , stop , stop or cancel the output .
if there is an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; there can be an application for example , if you have a speaker set up , whose language is English and whose gender is female , otherwise it will be the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; one speaker will be chosen , see you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the map speaker to add or click Edit on the list or click Edit , the map features will be displayed as an example for the installation of the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Module &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; details on the modules can be found below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable program . if the path is to be included in PAT@@ H , you &apos;ll have to enter a festival only .
select the string code for text , which will be handed over to festival . in general , this setting is automatically performed . generally speaking , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these shooting outlets , you make volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a few kno@@ b , then the voice cannot be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ Vo@@ ices will need to load several seconds due to their size . if you load this check box , these voices are already syn@@ thes@@ ized by the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with bigger memory usage ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have no speakers set up ( or forget to contact address ) .
if this check box is marked , at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr displayed in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this makes you the possibility to keep reading or otherwise control .
here are all orders placed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the contract , the number of pro@@ positions and the just processed sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the speaker ID on the map card speaker .
with buttons in this series you can choose a full @-@ purpose in the list where you select or go back in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of settings ( also on the other map cards ) are taken over and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio map . see also .
here only text contracts are listed and managed by Screen Saver Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News will not be displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the relevant audio module compiled or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module , select the PCM device here .
make the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % is about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal speaking speed . so that these settings may be converted , the program will need to be installed .
click Apply to Apply the new settings for the ongoing &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices contains all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device is working with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this map card you can set specific actions , which will always be carried out if the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of voice contracts :
the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the received orders are res@@ umed .
war@@ nings have the next top priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you are &amp; eg ; just welcome a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; yet someone who enters the room .
will a text contract interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound are active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map card apply only for normal text s@@ lugg@@ ages . for news , war@@ nings and expenses of screen re@@ funds , there are no particular actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .

the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice @-@ over@@ s . it also contains brands for the control of voices , speaker speed , volume , gender , voice and pitch for example . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( brit@@ ish male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the SS@@ ML edition .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ positi@@ onal sign filter ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must divide the text into single sentences . thus , it can also be syn@@ thes@@ ized by the first set or cancel , or cancel , or cancel , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pro@@ positi@@ onal ad@@ mitt@@ ent filter . it can also change its settings or add further pro@@ positi@@ onal ad@@ dic@@ ation filters , but beginners will do not use it .
on the easiest , you can learn the configuration of the speaking selection by trying . then switch off the microphone selection , and check out a few features and check out how the choice of the speaker has changed , and of course you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start faster with the pre@@ read , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block that can last very long ,
you can then stop or cancel text contracts then , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal sign filter is automatically set , if you &apos;re off t@@ sm@@ gr to the first time . it cannot be dis@@ connected , unless you do nothing at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ positi@@ onal pro@@ positi@@ onal filter compar@@ es text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ular sign ( Dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the typ@@ ing limits ( tab@@ s are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard set @-@ level panel fil@@ tering filter has a character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ r ) , War@@ nings , News or the Issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ as .
if you remove from Ver@@ ify the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal sign filter , you can paste this again by charging the file _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
the card option allows you to write the speaker settings for the application . the map card will be displayed if
using the standard speaker ( the upper@@ most on the map card speaker ) . in other words , there will be no speaking properties .
use of the most pass@@ able speaker , which has all features of a furnished speaker system . if you choose to delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings ; choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker does not choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the actors choose the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired communication features by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
choose the features of the desired microphone station . if this property doesn &apos;t play any role , don &apos;t give you anything .
mark this check box if the property should have prec@@ e@@ dence over other features . here you can also set multiple markings .
as the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue , it will always be used as a priority feature . the only case , if you might want to specify the attribute language , if you might know that a certain application text was sent in another language than that of the working environment .
to use all properties in the field of speaker , please use the key signature , click on the select button and use the speaker that matches the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last word order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required 0 ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it &apos;s started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts . probably you have to register the G@@ ST register . if the problem is not resolved if the problem is not resolved , you may not have a compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update G@@ Stre@@ amer or un@@ install .
the audio edition via AL@@ SA does not work if I stop playing with another application . if I hold a text job , fri@@ ghtened &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears . a message appears to be said : &quot; to open PCM .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts can occur at AL@@ SA , which results in simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices . references for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ Pro@@ ect@@ .org .
I have loaded an additional voice for the festival on the internet . I installed them and can &apos;t use it in Festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr doesn &apos;t show that voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL , where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card card there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program So@@ x have to be installed and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ s like festival interactive will provide an adjustment for speed . depending on the selected voice , this function is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaker speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is about your own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the transformation of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you &apos;re totally brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML format , and put up the microphone speed up .
I don &apos;t create that websites with a female voice can be read . I have set up a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . with this festival there is no mistakes for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber , GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own string fix@@ ture filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ in or go back . on the box guide it is displayed only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
you can not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( point , question marks , Com@@ ma and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) . use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection instead .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio edition . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start a text if you want to start a text and then proceed further . possible solutions for this problem you can find on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with state July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you have a text in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will still be read .
the audio program So@@ x is used for general setting of speaking speed , but otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install So@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install So@@ x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs .

before you check &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if your voice syn@@ thesizer properly works . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ; set .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are delivered with Festival . would you like to proceed to web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from Festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions .
this voice sets the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in a festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you must opt for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the Linux ; distri@@ butions . look for the first time on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c option , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then takes over the le@@ x@@ ographic analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

this guide explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , one module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; which allows you to manage network interfaces , and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ control@@ center ; can be called ..
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; create a simple surface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; displays . the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched through selection of k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is enabled at all and enables the setting of network features .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed in installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . network devices will have to be installed later , the driver by adjusting the following files will be loaded , according to the kernel version :
the network settings will be loaded if the network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; index variable . when starting the module network settings , this is automatically identified by the system on the system .
if the platform is not recognized , the platform is offered by selecting from the list , the distribution and rele@@ asing is best . due to marking the setup non @-@ re @-@ ask , the setting can permanently be taken permanently . in the next start of the network settings then this option is automatically pre@@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing the network settings are only possible in system management mode . previously , all options can only be considered to be considered . in the system management mode , you can proceed to the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the system management mode , the total functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage network systems of the system . all available network devices are displayed . on the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button ... in the dialog device can be processed .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button to set the dialog with further options .
with the selection of Autom@@ atically , TCP / IP settings are taken using a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information will automatically send all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore no further option is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP may be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration may be specified . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as Properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not used in the network . entering an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . you can find whether the required address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network appliances can be activated or disabled depending on the need . turn on a network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network appliances can be activated or disabled depending on the need . switch off a activated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and by clicking on the interface ....
establ@@ ishes the IP address of the host in local sub@@ net , which provides physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a calcul@@ ator with DNS support replaces complete IP address . this is necessary because computers only calls IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org trig@@ gers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for nam@@ ing the name of this list allows a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS records can be re@@ ordered by selecting a contract and up or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons up or down in the priority .
by clicking the button you can add a DNS server to the name resolution , a DNS server can add a DNS server . it will add the dialog New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the button to add . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click on the Edit menu .... It will be displayed by the dialog .
the list of well @-@ known computers describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address connection for the TCP / IP Sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally the list contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will support them . this is still the current version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well known computer and click Add .... The dialog for the new alias add will be shown .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the button to add . if the well @-@ known computer has multiple alias name , de button add several times and enter the other alias name .
select one entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog &apos;s dialog is displayed .
one of the following tasks can be executed , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the network settings are not effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready version is recommended for less experienced users . it is just the rpm package to download and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; you should comp@@ ile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be discussed , in the second , all are reviewed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; amended configuration files .
this area cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information is convey@@ ed via the integration of the PC in a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are being operated using TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . from IPv6 it is expected to pass through IPv6 in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the widespread IP@@ v4 .
one of the most important information is to assign an IP address of a network interface . in external networks , on &amp; eg ; Work@@ place is the network administrator either hur@@ ting or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up an own small ( Home ) network , IP address should be used specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded , therefore , its use is possible .
of course the access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range of 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networking to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second most lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) . the standard route is required for IP transfer .
the address of 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in its own machine . normally the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file will sometimes be dynam@@ ically modified with DSL connections , so that if in case of active DSL connections , there is no other content than set there .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is re@@ ass@@ orted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another state can occur therefore .

the default dialog appears ; -@@ Print dialog . if you choose to choose , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have expanded per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of users .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; , for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a f@@ use program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the second goal was to answer a question for tar , which provided my wife : how much longer it takes ?
before a band can be used , it has to be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and read the pre@@ tension of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; if the spell in the band will not be asked if the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the procedure , looking for the right index on your disk . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index will be newly created .
everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the tape has been incorporated into the status bar . the content of the tape can now be searched by selecting the entry for the band .
before throwing off the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; specifies a change in symbol for the band that the bond has been solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be kicked out without danger .
before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; it has to be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
one band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this procedure does not conform to the form@@ att@@ ing of &amp; k@@ dat ; this procedure does not have to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; however , floppy tape drives are usually not form@@ at@@ ted . DA@@ T drives are not form@@ at@@ ted .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all the data on the tape is lost , the band is automatically mounted and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you must select the backup files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in local file tree . it is secured only this file or folder .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be secured .
mark files in a local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the She@@ er menu ...
once the backup was launched , the dialog for backup will open . in this dialog you can check once the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears secure . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the archive in record for the drive . it will be checked only the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archive for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders can be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry test ....
once the test procedure has been launched , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog appears to check out . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files that are to be recovered . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to record for the tape drive . it will only be restored to select the selected file or sub@@ folder .
mark the desired files from one of the archive with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders can be recovered .
with the right mouse button , click a file or folder in one of the archives and choose to restore in the menu .
once the restore process has been launched , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the work folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for rest@@ oring , the dialog appears to restore . this dialogue shows the progress of recovery and the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to create a re@@ inde@@ xed file based on the tape . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this is a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can carry out the following settings :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current work folder where the backup is to be carried out . the list of the will be updated automatically according to the newly elected work@@ folder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for any folder , which are listed under backup files , is that only the files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are displayed on other file systems . each entry is considered from tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is secured since the last incre@@ mental backup .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since last incre@@ mental backup is used .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; s ; and lt ; files was not yet implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the belt device .
if the tape is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the load is connected to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat is trying to lock the failure at tape drive . possibly this setting doesn &apos;t work with all band drives .
if the option is enabled , the inser@@ tion of &amp; k@@ dat is automatically e@@ jected . use this option not to floppy disk drives .
if the option is on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block@@ age . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you &apos;ll need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size will communicate for your band cycle .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only be a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , with the name of the full name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the band has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar @-@ archives created directly with &amp; GNU ; but tar can manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a cover tape . this symbol is only active if a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system or where the system enables quick access to information about problems , which occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what makes your calcul@@ ator in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored on the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables fast access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some extended functions , which can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . among others include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and sam@@ ba
many other functions also include and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system log ; functions are available , with their help you can easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file to sorting and fil@@ tering the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log is attemp@@ ted to open the system protocol , and it will not open , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you &apos;ll normally do not get on system administrator . the protocol files usually have no just@@ ification for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter out the filter bar in order to select a string into the filter bar . in the default setting , select the list box next to the selected filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter keyword .
you can also select another entry at this point . select the column string of the filter keyword will then select the name of a process , and then apply the name of a process , and will show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines which have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default settings and helps you to identify the important protocol lines . note @-@ lines of the level errors are displayed with a show@@ less color than protocol lines . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can select the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command like the start of Samba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add @-@ new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use several protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . in order to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log in menu to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information about the source Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it develops rapidly for control the program starts when moving the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it &apos;s easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD inhibit@@ ors .
I will not enter into historical aspects here ( such as I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ aries is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . it is therefore important because maybe someone could try to gain a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and new format . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it also differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. d@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service which you want to start off the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial that is only started once . such views are after r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be either under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it &apos;s not much use for it . you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the default run@@ level is entered / etc / in@@ itt@@ any . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column , and probably determine that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix them by hand , then proceed to the system when you rest@@ art the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder you don &apos;t find real files . instead , each entry is link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : every scrip@@ ting is written that it &apos;s a argument like start and stop . you can actually launch this scripts from hand to command line :
this would stop the htt@@ pd server . it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will be hit with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; one server @-@ Run@@ level , which can only run htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . also , I could even run a user @-@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other hand @-@ device is simple to say not to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move the scripts between Run@@ levels or change the position within one level . this will not be removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only occur if you prefer an entry from the area of available services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed when you prefer this in a new area . to select them from the menu Edit or from the context menu , and then insert in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed before the action range .
sometimes the sorting number of a single entry can sometimes be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service .
note : there are no possibility to restore records that were thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so , be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working ranges ( check @-@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
in order to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the tab@@ ulator button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by typ@@ ing the input button to accept or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are taken in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences will be taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; re@@ produced . changes to pre@@ ferences will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eln , and now the machine launches new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in a single use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you have to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the method , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , is simplified for the proprietary software programs of this distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if any configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) are simply without news , if its configuration files are not available or wrong .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; read .
after you have made changes , you need to save this . either you use the appropriate symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry store in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy use . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user forces . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some map cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you have any wild@@ card settings , if you have individual settings , if shadow -@@ passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD UNIX .
the password management card appears , if shadow -@@ passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD univers@@ es .
this map card appears only if for at least an embedded file system plac@@ ements ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ as / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here , any user limits can be modified for each user .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field file system .
the maps Group informs groups of the selected users . the standard group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ inary Group field . furthermore , the user can join in other groups by selecting this in the large field .
the dialog &apos;s dialog box contains a list of users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
in order to add a user or a group , select addition from the user or group or click the suitable addition button of tool@@ bar . to edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogue .
with this module you can add the L@@ ILO @-@ Boot@@ Manager , remove and change the time to bo@@ oting the default operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change systems , change , change , and more .
