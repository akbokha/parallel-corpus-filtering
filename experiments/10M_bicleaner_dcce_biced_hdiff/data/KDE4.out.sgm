<seg id="14">The special feature of & fsview; consists in it, shallow file-map graphically with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is proportional to its size. this size must have the size of the size of the subordinated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & fsview; reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it. according to this way, large files can be easily detected, if they are far recognized in the file format. according to that, it can be considered a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; an entry in the Treemap shows a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. to simplify navigation, the right rectangles and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over color mode can be either deep for the easy detection of shutter-depth or the illustration of another file peculiar as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>

<seg id="19">For Settings algorithm for Treemaps should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & fsview, this goal is not always available. note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the allocation of the area of an entry for the subordinated entries, the implementation will be left. here it is possible for marking and avoiding space losses through frame always beneficial to the spaces that are as possible. the best methods for this are lines, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimal displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view. instead, a RautenID is drawn into the area of an orderly entry, in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an orderly entry.</seg>

<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - away from the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage. each of the photos decreases, scanned or digital photos saves a form of digital stock management. but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We will give you a tool, find a plan and practical tips how to secure your photos, use, protect and convert photos. we will focus on the method for digital photographers, backup, assure, assure, assure, evaluate, archive, and export and export image files.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you'll certainly not know how many photos you have, then you'll certainly use a certain picture as well as in the image files to store very fast searching and a secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">First you do and know what to do in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide whether other access to your photos may have to save or put them on a stored drive, or if you have to switch them to a larger drive, you must have to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your memory location. if you're ready to organize your date, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. and then you will publish a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like, versioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% unemployment files have, and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes forklifts easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies the backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata in the metadata page. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forget, then you can select the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens when you want to change? this puts & digipact, an metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now start the real work, since you should select all photo keywords, labels and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that you want the same attribute. this makes sense, since you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keycodes, keywords, like to use other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digiplug; the tree for you will build the images to the right place. the umsorption of the hierarchy in the tree is no problem and can easily be performed by pulling a subtree on another. the changed keyword will be followed by & digial; updates the lower trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows like different metadata. this is a very rough representation because each block of metadata is composed of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalogate your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They want to let most niemate your photos simply view, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to arrive like your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then start to see some details, people, space.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the landeposition of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing is. Wow! it is beginning to dream, memories, the historical period of time is present again, you may even hear the silence, so your perception has been completely changed.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others the title is probably more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show images you should tell us a story. remember, the key is to help you to understand Him about the motif that she has moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's fine when a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength to work only with a label for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug, you can export a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then you can even export it to a selection of pictures at the same time. if you export your pictures into web-galleries, then you will have to tell you the name of the web-galeriesystems. you will have to tell you the story for opening a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with images the train leaves the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolocalization can be dispensitive and will be deeper into the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can also download the photos at the reception. you can also export the photos at the reception. you can also export photos to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word match with copyright and denotes the practice to remove any limitations regarding the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all modified versions, so also for the work.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is stored in the setting page of & digiplug; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creators and author): this field should not include your name, or the name of the person that has been created. if it is not desired, the name of the photographer can be saved, then it should not be changed once again. this field does not support Comma nor Semikolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonym for author line): linked to the author. this field contains the work title of photographers. examples may be as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a memo to the author field, it must be filled in.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working as a message agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then you can see the picture here. if the picture is a bearing picture, then the group / agency offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright laws, although this does not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in work with calculator. for individuals, this problem is only very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique. & digiplug; in the near future, there will be such a module for forklift processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, disk failures, power stations, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desertification, vitrety, temperature, data size, widespread aberration</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that went on the road or a fire. this type of losses are the same that you may also have traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's biggest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics what reasons have a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, this cautious needs to be treated more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that will claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your measuring space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you are good Disks and good recording sessions, and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write much reliable. it is about to choose the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for mistakes, even if you've just been written for the formatting and the control environment. despite this massive protection they are needed for formatting and the control environment. despite this massive protection they use it through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a cheap program called IsoBuster to appear on CDs and DVDs. it is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged floppy disks, drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks appear to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store up to 50 GB, making it almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything about CDs and DVDs has been also applied to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder to store and check the media with a description, date & author identifier and afterwards stored in a clean, dark dry and on animals protected place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppy disks retain their statistics for themselves. your branch profiles include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a big field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks keep the error in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in case of lower temperament, error rates are increased dramatically. some of SMART may not determine the error. some of SMART are the most likely failure. this is especially Lesefehler and Verlagsrator. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power failure before switching the files, but these losses can normally be made without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not work much, it looks different with devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause serious loss of keys, entire data loss, hardware age, destructive motherboard and other defects. protect yourself from avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against ratips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device absorbs and the rest erdet. however, it is normally found in the form of a plug-in bar. remember that not every plug-in bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay the UL 1449 standard. this ensures a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protect against hot flashbacks and thus protects the proper devices connected.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should also check that all peripherals which can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide transfers for your modem. others also offer an telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV map.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and they also contain the protection for the modem. thus, they are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be meaningful in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection from overvoltage, these devices can automatically keep battery power when charging the system. some models allow them to work out until the stream again. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that they get the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the provided software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember potential risk, which is exposed to your computer system and compare your security while preventing this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be purchased for less than & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you're using it. at the end, you should always think of all cables to trenne before you arrive in your holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives too, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. beyond that, you need to send data about comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions therefore occur only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo), and Photo-Community 23hq.com provide online memory services that are spacialized on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB, and you will not provide you in full resolution online, in case of Flickr dramatically. for $25 per year you will receive unlimited memory, which should only be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the viewpoint of data security, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted and the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributor memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transfers are prone to transfer errors. the file system fs and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you cannot tell you when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances occurred. it is fairly disturbing that there is no protection for it. no one seems to have thought in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer datory than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transfers, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal filesystem, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems appears to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with squads and can be highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL-compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon as well as for Windows and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha-status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for & Linux. it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data losses related to notebook and 46% at the workstation systems. in case of notebooks, the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage than such as theft or modification. and there is currently only very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the examination during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if however, a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics to all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteriorized for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or greater formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is currently available for 100 & euro; so you do not have any data loss for data loss. so, make sure your data often have been affected by a data loss. secure your data in any problem like the reinstallation of your operating system, replacing boards or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a flash, you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster fails locally and destroys a lot. forget planes, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data dangerous enough. they usually affect a whole space or a complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterpreventive always means no local storage. bring your fuse up the stairs to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above, a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup which is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and provides a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Securing: a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup period. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last fuse. creates the original status at any time. this backup is made in order to restore such a backup. this backup is only unlocked and not continuously running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script controlled ftp sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only the difference of files that really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase your security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer at a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. every other thinning should be done manually, after which you have made a complete check.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., usage of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable images will survive the next 40 years that you are really interested in you because they are really interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noticed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you have to look at careful and reassess during the time. unfortunately, there is no other way forward as a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should have used yourself as the current system backward, the easier is to rate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by declarations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that for reading your pictures is important, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your calculator architecture, your memory and fuses technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the table print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go from which you have planed the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and copy the to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new disk was detected by the system but do not hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC # source, the new record is / dev / SDC and dollar; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; reze2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier for year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was used as an open source standard which should replace GIF. it can save as much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, but not as many as TIFF, but not as many as TIFF has needed and a slow compression. this format will we recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. it manages images in high quality, but needs very large files. with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format. however, there is more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a free-free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is now based on the need for the camera to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology; it is a mixture of XML and RDF; it is a mixture of XML and RDF; it is a mixture of XML and RDF; the file information is allowed with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive the metadata separately from the video file, and as it can be noted above the file format. therefore, you should remember whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organisation supporting a wide range of application purposes and business models. to the activities of DCMI-Communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarified efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera plate, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your shell archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut in under circumstances of the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined images for copyright with a digital watermark. export it then in Webgalery, add to MPEG, you can use in contact, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug. in the section add photos to an album you can already add photos that you already have already on your hard disk, but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your album tank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect this with the computer, turn on the camera on the ad mode, and switch them on. another description will be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start camera interface, you try to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a remote indicator appears at the lower end and the thumbnails of all photos are displayed. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file extension refers to any file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information about each entry. with the lateral features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of an entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows filtering characteristics and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. please note that some digital cameras do not have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer remark, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the meta-side bar from the main window of & digiplug. note that these metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera into a single album, and we recommend you to check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album, before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, select only the desired option with the standard selection methods of & kde; download the button Download and then select Download. the button selection is as long as long as you looked, until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, there is an option New to download. these images have not yet been downloaded from & digiplug. in this case, the new pictures are selected with a star in the front box. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download and download the buttons, select a dialog with which you can select the target album, see the list of existing albums, where you can read the list of existing albums, in section My albums, select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After having selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; charges the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. if you want to delete all you want to delete all of this, you must select it first and delete it from deletion.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no way to delete photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should not be deleted if the photos are successfully deleted, if you want to delete the camera from the camera. if you want to delete the camera storage, you should get this much faster than this camera.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames for the photos. the filenames are usually reutilized after the photos from the camera. this may be meaningful if you have photos of various recordings into the same album. therefore, it may be meaningful, the date and time to integrate the picture in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for date-based subverbs. if you use this latter option, a folder will automatically be created.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission, three further options will be carried out before the photos are stored on the record. if you select this, the relevant entries from the EXIF data will be copied to the IPTC fields. with the latest option, you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want to use another date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% d% d% H:% S. turn off the date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the command of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera file name, you have the possibility to change the filename in lowercase letters. or in uppercase letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new File name, the & digiplug; used for a photo, is indicated below the name, the camera is stored in preview. your settings are saved and automatically used when you open the camera.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to make an automatic turn of the camera. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information which embedded your camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera is not delivering & digiplug. if you want to switch off the automatic turn off, use the button extension and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made available on the picture, at which the photo was made, can use & digiplug. this substructure is based on the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Meta-data you can read what information is embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case saves & digiplug; the photos directly in target album. if you want to change this option, use the button extension and select the option datas based on the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from their calculator on your camera is to download. then select uploading. the file dialog dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload files. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiplug; you, where the images will be loaded high. select the folder dialog for the camera. choose the desired folder and press OK to load the uploading. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a common term in this document. this means that the data can be displayed in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the detection of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not just for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to create an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planer, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have later forgotten, where exactly the photo was done, you can view the area with a click. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious; users want to localize the place of photos, or simply document this aspect, it is well the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the image? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the data in this fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reprocessing of GPS data and image files with the CONTI module for geographic assignment (manual) and most recently about manual input from well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera to integrate a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using gpsman or GPSBabel. you must save these data in the GPX format, since this is the only format supported by the module to geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for Windows; and Mac OS which can extract and correlate the data from images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length and latitude and latitude, then you can use these script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the coordinate coordinates that can be created e.g. from maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road types. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation data for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digiplug; try to give as much control over his work runs as possible. in order to access these settings, you must select the settings of the digiplug; set up in eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side.</seg>

<seg id="286">Autortitel is synonymous for the author: this field should be the job title of the photographer. this field should be a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a further description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author, then these organizations should be registered, then these organizations should be listed here. if the picture is a bearing picture, then the group or agency should be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions save the data into the respective IPTC field. this is achieved, the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of & digiplug; these metadata is also available and can be imported into & digiplug; imported without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labeled as embedded labelling (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you may add to your photos, with the images embedded in the images, they can also be found with inscriptions, these are overwritten by the digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats. in order to specify which data types & digiplug, you can add the file extensions of this list and remove any file in a & digiplug; Albumfolders that does not have any of these extensions; also ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire by & digiplug; this site can be set on this page. however, some pictures have different sizes and synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can only get on quick computers. if you have one, then you can get better image results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can switch them here. you can use the tool bar, when you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brighter color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this vision can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling it is meant that the pictures are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in Farbinations. please read this article in Wikipedia on the close account.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG-Compression, you can reduce the size of PNG-files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, since PNG has a loss-free algorithm. if you have a quick host, you can set this value to a high compression. it means 1: low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF-file, you can turn the deflate compression anogical algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality since the deflate algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can easily save loss. even if you write the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata is still not supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digiplug, the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very quick to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the image processing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default index is that all green pixels are equal to sensitive to ultra-ultraviolet light. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option features a bit soft, eliminates the picture a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 gittering pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, whiteboard used to use the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white drain is not set. standard is a solid color balance, which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors will get the effect that substrated images will get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top level, so the parts of your images are burned to capture as permeated white in the settings. in addition, use some unusual results as it shows the peak in various roses. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from top things.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels is generally not so fast as green and red. & craps are therefore not trying to reconstruct the missing green and red shares of the still not saturated blue pixels. naturally, this is a question how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, select the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it higher than the standard 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of the & digiplug; in order to keep the time for the demoosaicing small, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo algorithm is a digital image process to create a complete picture from the image data that have many cameras and is known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbrewood.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw are available to you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm created by DCraw. it produces color-quality algorithm in the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour deviation of your lenses you can use the red and blue correcting values here. this is certainly the best method for a color variation, as it is done during raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions to be given back. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information such as the color information of a colour space in the others are the colors as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions if a picture is opened in the image processing and start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folders choose the folder, such as / usr / share / color / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digiplug; this folder examines during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC-Profile You have here the possibility & quot; default squot; for your profile. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The paint form view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures colourless did not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should not fit to the camera applicant and model that you can use. currently there are some examples like Canon, which does not contain any color toner or limbs. this means that you do not need to perform the colour mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the Soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate, as your printer can be given back, because your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colours are therefore very saturated, instead you can manually adjust to the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile for them is foreseen. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style of the target: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portray and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & kde; educational and image processing is supported. many modules are supported to work with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you see a list of available modules. choose which you want to use, and these modules are then loaded as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond, find some also in the context menu of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that can be performed by modules, can be set in menu Shortcuts Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get via the KIPI project using http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the images, normally are 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes switch the metadata a resp., which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features are displayed on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras. if you want to use a camera which is connected to the computer, make sure that the camera is properly connected, turned on and in screen display mode. currently, serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass memory are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom of the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass camera from camera message.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, you need to connect the camera to your computer to display them in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if & digiplug; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera amodell and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is shown in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation of confirmation of &gt; images in the trashcan, you can set the conversations of & digiplug; when you delete a photo in an album, you'll find more details when deleting a photo and deleting of a album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be used to use & digiplug; if you apply the option changes in the right side bar without feedback. otherwise, you must use the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also start the display of the high-performance shielding of & digiplug. this will accelerate the start process of & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="334">The halt at the start of the new pictures forces & digipments; the basic folder for new or dissolved albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digiplug; if something comes from the base folder, ask & digiplug; you, whether it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different colour schemas can be used in & digial; in order to adjust the main window to your taste. this settings can be used to select Settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug; you will find further information on this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can view this to view and correction and improve the image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by selecting the entry menu / editing menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digis. they are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, you will find more information about the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current filename and current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and among them the toolbar for fast access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of imaging change your photos. however, the original photo will not change before saving file or button saving from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo, once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you may add a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done using file stores.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you don't have saved the photo image, you can restore the original image, by using from the menu, restore the image processing in the toolbar. they lose any change in which you have done in the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit Republics by selecting Edit Replication from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should remember the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -z to reverse and see Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you use the & LMB; click on the backlog or reproduce button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are also reversed and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can use the photos in the same album or the same keyword in the toolbar, picture up, image down or the entries in the menu. if you have changes the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can get in the photo and out out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the pineal menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: enhance enlarging factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want this to use the Esc key. usually you can call this in the dialog dialog by & digiplug. you can also call this in the Settings dialog by & digiplug. view this section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print the image and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can select single pictures or complete phrases. all images are printed from your selection. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select the wizard from the album export wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug; main window has a side bar at the right edge, which is important for the selected pictures and promotions for the selected pictures, also available in image processing. it will be shown if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider lets the sidebar appear and disappear into the edges.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can input labels with unlimited size or add. note that all the special characters are allowed. this means that all the special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut into 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labels in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented on either the button address or switch to the next picture, the labels will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the turn-button there is a button More. you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also read the metadata in the files, but you can always have a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a valuation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorrows. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar, or with the keyboard shortcut. to rate several images at the same time, select these from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to the filtering of the keyword, the keyword and a selection box with the previously applied in this & digiplug; -session applied.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword will be dynamically adapted to the search word. you can restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief when typing the keyword in a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, they are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keyword can also be set by marking the corresponding checkboxes in the tree. all words of an image are stored in the IPTC field keycode.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword, if you want to select a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - data, sampling and search options. if additionally, one or more keyword will be used, only the cut volume of these two are displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw keywords and place. suppose you have selected several pictures to place you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply put it out of the right side bar and place a dialog that asks you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword is reduced to no keywords, which was selected to the selection of strings + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword will be drained and stored there. a dialogue asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off under settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and create and determine that it should be one or more, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): enter the entry after which is found in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can e.g. set a Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly worked on & digial; s specifically adjusted implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one uses a colorless workflow, which can have a prefable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a colorized workflow, you can achieve that the colors are printed on your camera or scanners, or the colours you want to print or appear in the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color scheme, then everybody wants to press whom buttons are to press. unfortunately, colour management is to provide you an adequate background information about color management. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informal decisions to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image has been fulfilled all six listed criteria, then you don't have to worry about color scheme.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (you will find more information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions include e-mail or web, where sRGB of de-facto Standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and the life for all so easy to use, then why should you do another color space and have to worry about hdules?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see, the hufeisenregion, and the colors in the RGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colors, visit Bruce Lindblooms side and click on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor when I decided to work in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB color space or do not, you need your monitor kallibriers, since sRGB is based on sRGB, then you must use your monitor on sRGB standard kallibriers to use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. use it, before you try any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, deviate and contrast from the menu Corrigate Automatic corrections automatically try to make your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the lamp readings over the whole picture, so the dark point black and the brightest point as light as possible without changing his colour. this function is often a gastric correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Abusing: this method adjusts the luminous factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity range is as flat as possible. it also generates a very powerful operation which causes either miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright limestone tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the complete histodate range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the lightest of the RGB values of a picture by shifting the lowest and highest values of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The whitening of & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the whitening of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is somewhat limited to work with 8-bit per color. if you are able to do so far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. in case you can do the white abdominate in rough mode, which in 16 bit mode, your possibilities will be better to correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white salad of copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it via the menu entry colours white cover of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side the original image is adapted as well as the preview of the tool. if you want to see the original protein directly, it is enough to click on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminance of Pixels in this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a histogram is indicated that you can change a parameter once you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images that will see most pixel very small Luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjust the shadow of your photos or down to dimming your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then click on this button to calculate the color temperature of white color. this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white off with the preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The Overexposed indicator increases the colors, if more than a color channel of Pixels is overexposed. this will display the combined result in white color. this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Save buttons and store exactly this. each setting of white balancing you have set you can save to a text file and load later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets down all filter values back on their standard values and their neutral white grains. note that even neutral settings will be shown to another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding level per color channel of the machined image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high quality images, but it is only needed for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialogue as to the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be found in the chapter color scheme.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menue under colors of audio files. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust to multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use it for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always require the same error and you will always need the same error correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposing problems is the tool of gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug; tool paint effects gives you four color effects, a set of solar effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, was called Solarisation, also called Sabatians, a effect of the image. the colored, dark areas protected by the additional light. this result was a partial negative image of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this very interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar panels. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically possible. another increase is finally created, that it is not produced on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar thermal effect. the original image is (1) and the work (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that makes the colours brilliant and glowing. try it easy, he beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a daylight produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore, a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias offers very rich colours with daylight and high contrasts, but also some photographers, especially those that hardly shows the landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the level level controls the brightness of the results and the slips repetitions. in large images the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it's not unusual that you want to correct the color reload and the lightness of the photos. you can experiment to experiment the various color-effects of your photos with the tools in the menu. if you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo of bad light conditions, you can reduce the reverse problem. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation can take a good choice rather than it. if you like the result, you can confirm the outcome with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchma / contrast / Gamma is the tool key correction to improve the exposure. also, if the dialog for this tool has been very complicated, you only need the range of shooting. in concrete the three slide below the HistoProgram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, an histogram, the active canal or the selected area. among the graphs there are three shifts into the inside. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the control is to move the control knob and make sure how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side you can see the original and preview of the image. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted to see if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic y axis is often dominated by a single column. in this case the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the uppermost for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, frequently gammaids.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the inputs, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output rated: the output values allow the selection manual values for each area. there are also two knob that can be used in order to change the output values, for example, the compression of output values can be used as background while something else is visible in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values will be automatically set depending on the values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: buttons are stored in the file system and reloaded it later and later the Gimp levels can be used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and the three color pipette will automatically be adjusted for all shade, means and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click the preview of the original Image for Red, Green, Blue and Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option Undercover Indicator controls all color channels to view over exposed pixels and you can view the combined outcome of all channels. this means, you will only see the effect in preview and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the entries applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image is displayed. the preview can be updated dynamically depending on your settings. the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selbox allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this box are two symbols between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that were recorded with a digital camera, the linear mode of a constant color creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short valves to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see these bright tones with a darker pronunciation and the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The preview of the original photos is a red mark to see. if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original value, create a point on this line and move it on and off, until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and store: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. any curve which you can have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp score format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed indicating Indicator controls all color channels to view over exposed pixels. if in more than a channel, you will see the combined result, that is, you will only get the effect in preview and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and suntones has been applied with the color pipette and adjusted to the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Channel Mixer of & digiplug; imaging is a tool to enhance the colour channels or change the color shots of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another high-developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first reference like you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison on your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the image, a vertical line in the histogram shows you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The module for the module are right below: knob for red, green and building allow you to mix these channels. this is especially convenient if you want to protect the respective color components. this is especially convenient if you want to reduce the color components. this is especially convenient if you want to reduce the color components of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color appears to a visible smokers that occur from the same place in the colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if that's the case, you can reduce your Monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colouring first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and shop buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any blender adjustment allows you to save and then load. this used file format is the Gimp-mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option Undercover Indicator controls all color channels to view over exposed pixels and you can view the combined outcome of all channels. this means, you will only see the effect in preview and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the object luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the machined picture below (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / White-photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photographs, black / white is a step, since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of filmstrip profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lineup. this looks great, with all the scene images and fits especially well for portraits against heaven. so similar to 004 Cokin (TM) Green filters.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangy: simulates a black / white film volume with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film irradiation with a red line filter. this creates some dramatric effects and can simulate moongs for the daily time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film irradiation with a yellow lens. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and middle tones to date. this is very similar to the process of failure of a print and re-development in a Sepiature.This is typical for photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digiplug; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures on an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensional texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the picture below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2). the parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digiplug; tool frame, a decorative frame can be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task. a way to keep his attention is to keep the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the streching eye. in the picture frame, the module can be started using the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. consistent with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), splash it with a nice three-dimensional frame ideal for a button effect and decoratively adds a ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range is limited to 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with the context of decorating target image will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially when you have used the tool.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple text in a picture at any location. this also goes to several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text, and place it with its attributes. the larger image, the larger the character set must be. at the end, you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. the picture is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">"" "each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed till you press the button" "" "OK" "". "after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="469">With the digiplug; tools stencil, you can place a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template apply in the image processing can be used to put templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For stencil there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. but if you want to add a stencil file size. if you want to add a stencil template to the & digiplug, please send an e-mail to the & digiplug; mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool to first use, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for templates, a template's folder is reflected by the folder's folder's folder. selecting a folder will update the template templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resizing: this button resides the underlying image below. if you want to use the mouse button, you need to set the template to the whole picture, check the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template on your image. the image will be automatically adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; presents three different tool for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpens is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple but produced, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness Mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture of sharply. you can actually use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus, as well as most digital images need a correction of sharpness. this means that sharp edges can be combined with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be viewed as a common colour. the same phenomenon is normally printed if colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras will normally need to create sharpening than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures have often been used to have a camera internal sharpening. however, images in raw materials must always be used during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn an edge filter already during reading the image. if you turn off this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by shooting a photo with the sharpening of sharpening. that can call you with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">This should be careful, because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhancing the noise of a picture the tool Refocus. you can achieve it via the menu application Correcting Refocus. on Refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. use the solution to shift the image a bit soft when using the menu entry corrigate and experiment with settings. the prefist on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masks is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help to edit the image. the preview pane showing the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often generate good results and should be tried first. if you make the unsharpness mask to be strong, rustling and the impression of grats close by sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of a edge through the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore shark images of the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The sum represents the percentage between the original and the bent picture which is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a breakage from the maximum RGB value and the difference of difference. it can be used as a minimum difference to a edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change can be avoided by the killing and therefore fuse flaw in faces, celestnuts and water surface areas.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masks filter. the original image is the (1) and the machined image that was applied (2). unsharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digiplug; tool Refocus is focused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture on & quot; recurring quot; this is better than trying the photo to sharpening. it is using a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. this is better to use better results than unsharp mash. you can start using the menu by calling colors Refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular flow works much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauß 'sche has a very long tail, which is far away from the swelling of the Gauß's folding, which is far from the original quellation of the Gauß's folding, which is very strongly influenced by the remote pixels, which causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular file. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures should the default value 1 good results, however, if your image is very unsharp should then pay attention to Heiligenchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase in the room filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise level is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value will be more polluted.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß's sharpness. this parameter is the most commonly used to avoid unsharpness filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you might need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Mat size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. however, a increase of the matrix size can generate good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and shop buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameters will be stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to use all random, colour and intensity corrections on the image before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image. the reason for this is that much operations make changes not instantly visible, but later left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, eg. JPEG, you should apply the uncompressed image to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masks use a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically you need to create artifacts always artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it is never possible that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the Unsharpness Mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better for processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient lighting for auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of the sharpness correction in digital profiles, you can read a technical comparison to English below this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smooth the unsharpness of the area has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove non-desired artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail-keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoother about the image. the value of 0,9 should be obtained more homogenous regions and details that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the detail maintenance should always be subdivided.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directionality Alpha [0,100]: a small value smooth evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie-shaft similar pattern create a high value wave similar pattern. JPEG Artefacts will be found best at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum amount factor beyond alles. p then defined the relative smoothing. adjust this value to the level of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is more badly damaged, because it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally, here 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle relief da [5, 90]: angular integration of anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is selected, then it should also be small chosen. please note that small angle should generate a long runtime. so you should select this value so much and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixels smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the More quality you get by selecting this option is only low. it doubles, but we recommend it to let him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">Saving buttons as and shop exactly do this. any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and will be reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Errors correct is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last very long and a high CPU load bearing them. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Abort.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected using minor artefacts. the module is shown on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera, causing a bad film storage during the voyage. the original image is under (1) to see and corrected the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digiplug; space reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise. it uses the protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable images, to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair, can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireusable; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read it in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grafting noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow settings can stay in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time that the filter per pixel are needed and can be controlled by the radius and the color in it becomes smoother and fixed smaller bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the edge spacing. this value sets the pixel pitch to be placed in front of the filter. if it is increased, you might need to adjust the edges - if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image data can no longer get and roughing or reproach again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the whole noise can be removed or noise level can occur. if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminous tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change an image. these settings don't influence the smoother process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change an image. these settings don't influence the smoother process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerant values of the darker ranges, which typically are stronger, but also conducts the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phthalmic damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance reacts. if it is increased, it can remove noise and Phasenjitter on edges. it can remove space tips and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and loading: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how to change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected (2) and it was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crack for your purpose. this is fortunately for a bit soft to sharpening. use a lot easier than a picture to sharpening. use tool with the menu entry corrigate and experimenting with the hand side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digiplug; photo Food is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photoartacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts, movie-making, scratches, compression solicacts and local errors occur in digital, original or retroactively digitalized images. the smoothing takes the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and textures. the texturing replacement is carried out with a different tool, the image error correction. the algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / FrannÃ. it is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG isn't perfect, in some areas, it produces some compresses & quot; artefacts & quot; - small standards that are shown in uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">Saving buttons and store exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and will be reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last very long and a high CPU load bearing them. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with equal rhints. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded using a Minolta (TM) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie-grain on the faces. the original image is under (1) and corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures was applied to an old color photo, which has been used with a scanner. you can see the scan light from the scanner lighting and the photopapier. the original image is under (1) to see and corrected the picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digiplug; Tool Hotpixel offers it Hotpixel by photos that have been removed using a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead, or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw mode photos that have many cameras with JPEG compression about a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixquot; there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button Dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to take the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or light pixels by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the assistant will remark the last dark picture and recharges this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image and preview can help you correct within the image. the preview pane displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixel are highlighted in all forms areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters made available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durable: an average of neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. it is used separately for a 1-dimensional interpolation for a horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance from 1 of pixel are pulled along a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). they are used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are pulled to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a colour photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetic, i.e. the exposed corners of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can often cut the entire sensor range not equally illuminate. instead & quot; vignettieri; (shady) they can reduce the light that reaches the sensor there. Teleobjective is also taking this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be used with the Center filter, a hole of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise infiltration effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of modern cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centergel that is made without this filter, the transformation with a centerfilter has been applied without the filter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves you can control the Vignetizer correction filter and three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the highest density filter. the default density amounts to 2.0, which increases the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignetic, and reduce the density to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchma, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignetting correction reduces the intensity of the pixel. you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the knob needs only positive values if you have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine readjust the exposure of the target image, let the values for brightness / contrast / Gamma have zero and use the gradation of the & digiplug; image processing from the color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetizer correction is applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetport in the corners and (2) the correct image. a Leuchleke- and contrast correction was also performed with the image of this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug; linear distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses in photos. it uses the protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distorations can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but he laughs at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grades corrects the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second gradient. with negative values, tonnenannular distortions can be corrected and positive values are csensible distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of fourth degree. this value is stronger than in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'corners parameter has the reverse the parameter of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and leads through a correction of first gradient. negative values increase during positive the picture smaller.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values it increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrating the dialog box. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnal or kissensible correction should be performed before all random or magnitude changes. best result in this correction as all first. if you want to re-cut a picture and then perform a tonnal correction would be the effect of the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">In order to help you find the best correction for you. move the cursor in the image show around the dotted lines. move it to an important place, like the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this site. afterwards, you can correct the tonnen- / kissensible distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cissensible distortion, the resulting image will have black vertices. you can remove them from using the cutting tool or through the zoom of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the tonnengel correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives as for example shots from the front, frame and paintings, it's the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with the hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infrared film of Gimpguru.e.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the range for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Under the preview, you can adjust two parameters to adjust filming and censitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the gradient texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the quantity of filming and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels used to reproduce Infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to use black / white photos as the colour transformations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter made on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the machined image (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the shutter.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digiplug; filter film caster is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film graying on your images. this is known from classic highspeed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known as the sensitivity of films to increase the manufacturer's large silversionists.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to move into the past. the treated picture gets detached from daily life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, physical sight especially in your monochromen photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values need to be set to ISO-2400. if you need any more grains, then you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-effect unit on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digiplug; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digiplug; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to influence this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five. thick brush are better suited for big images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the work is marked with (2). pinching size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digiplug; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients in order to create a carboneskizze. the lines, which you imagine, are not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to skate you. these would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal label filter. the original image (1) and the changed picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses the protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with images with a simple structure, in which colour is not the most important at content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, mondared landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the painted picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by intersecrecy effects. it uses the protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: shares the image in cells and let it look like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelengths 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using unsharpness effects. it uses the protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: caught the image along the cross-shaped lines that simulates a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sporting photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radicals: caught the image by rotating the pixel to focus. this simulates the defuse of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Visual acuity: caught the image to create a non-focused camera nozzle. the object appears to occur in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of motion: caught the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the unsharpness of a linear moving, z: B: by car or train photographers, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Turntable Unsharpness: caught painting softly in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shining soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photographs or add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schütt: caught the image by accidental shifting of pixel and simulates the defuse of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpness: finds the colour basins in the picture and wipe them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make regentropes on your picture. thus, it gives natural your images a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dropping size allows to change the size of the drops. because the size of the image is not done automatically with the size of the image. number changes the number and density of drops. fish changes the optical effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiplug; keep an area free from regentropes. use the range of tools to choose the area, e.g. a face, which should stay freely in the area, the area will remain free from regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentric filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the transformers, or transformating.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blow is definitely one of the widest developed tools to enlarge a photo of a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you show a picture and guess what reaches the resolution of the resolution? how can you invent an image again? how can I reinvent the missing information? how can you see the missing information here? how can you see a good work here? try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformation size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is visible down.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available as tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the size of the original size of the original version is retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is more badly damaged, because it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons saving as and shop are used exactly. every single use for photo may be stored as text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo blow is very fast in what it makes, but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example for photo, showing a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the larger image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">"" "" "" "the cutting of a photos is not only a common operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse, and drag the mouse, and drag the mouse and move the mouse over you can move the mouse." ""</seg>
<seg id="641">When you get the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut out. thus, you can change a good overview like your photo by cutting. a new rectangle allows you to create a new rectangle using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting edge, use the button The random button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is added (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file to store the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the sight area, you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as high-format or landscape format. in high-format the larger value of the height and in width is assigned to width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always equal, regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the area for the maximum possible level, depending on the selected relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you are stored the cutting tool, these settings are stored in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data are reflected and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly help enable to allow help to assemble your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-rule, harmonious triangles are designed to share a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the aperture sheets of a sunflower. it shows in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you already used the golden partition in all times when you use your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 8, 13, 34, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that this rule is defined as visually harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center represents the liquid aid lines if you compose a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"" "the Golden Spirale will bring you good results to get closer to your photos. compared to the third-rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow." ""</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should be something that the eye can be put into the core of the composition. it can be a line to the core of the composition. this can simply be just there without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also from the above discussed golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equilangled triangles. diagonal to these lines can be seen as a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame your frame is called dynamic symmetry. try to place your focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach different.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. this way you can customize the color of the lines your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things came around an angle. you can fix this with the & digiplug. choose Transaction free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn off your picture with the slightest angle. the values on this slide is specified. by default, you can reset the slide again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help the module makes a horizontal and a vertical line available. move the cursor over the two lines. after you fix it via an important point of the picture, you can fix it to the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function transformation into the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option slips a bit after rotation. however, follow the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perversal transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right-hand side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas, created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas, created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle links below: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image becomes a bit slute. for a single adaptation this effect is small but two adaptations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes on the corners. a way to bersome is the picture with transformable cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool kit is used to move a portion of the image into one direction and move the lower part into the opposite. this is no rotation, the image will be distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via Transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors choose your image by using the horizontal angles and vertical angle. if you press preferences, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you will see a vertical and horizontal line built. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After having performed the shear, the picture will be caught a bit. for a single shear, this effect is usually negligible, but two shots generated twice as much destruction and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shear, the image has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is the picture with transformable cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the type as these libraries compile. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats to JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dckers from Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw, that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw-Image Converter appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides, if the camera settings are to be used for white and red / blue amplifier. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera is working in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and adjust the conversion results. JPEG uses a loss algorithm and is produced for the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to process your pictures frequently or later, otherwise you should not use the JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations allowed to deteriorate the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a memory format the metadata that contain in the RAW file are stored in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking machine mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time. use this mode, for example, for testing on a single picture which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available, however, the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>

<seg id="898">Once you have signed your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse through this browses, see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the picture, now in each group, so in people, places and in the group keyword entries are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories you have submitted your images and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current thumbnails are viewing.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse over the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only select the images on which both persons are visible. by this selective method, you can restrict the number of pictures shown by a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, places and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view images of your search area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. however, you can save with & photoalbum; but of course also for locations, keywords and other categories, which you have defined themselves. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to view images next to the name, select the button that's right outside on the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, please note that you can view the view for each category. in the appearing context menu, please note that you can view symbols for each category. (if you do not have a list of sample words).</seg>
<seg id="905">But you have to specify the image for each individual person. in order to view this, you will need to select the image editor, as shown in the picture, and select the image factor according to your wishes, and select that part of the image will be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "if you want to locate the entry in the main window, you will see a dialog, which is very similar to the dialog for laying the image properties. this dialog can look at the picture once more." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field label or description, the labels and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. for example, the date may either have a part of the overall date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures according to specific names, as you can see in the picture. here, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read handbooks, rather like to try features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photoalbum; and take a look at the quick start, screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & album photo album; and in the first dialog you can start the demo, if you start & Book photo album; for the first time, or choose a few example pictures you can start and you can try the functions of & album photo album; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the time bar. a picture of this bar you see here: as the name suggests, this glue shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time bar can display several different time units. each bar will show you another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can view a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar can be used in the following ways: you can change the displayed preview pane in the database (if you select a date, the time will always view the current date of the current images, if you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by clicking the mouse button, and the mouse over the ruler of the time bar, so select the time details. if you want to select a range, you can cancel the selection, by clicking on a bar of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; presents two possibilities to create HTML web pages with your pictures. the one is integrated into & photoalbum; integrated and the other as module is available; integrated version, which you can create via the File menu HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas, layout and target. in the following, each area is described above.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on kphoto album; HTML example, you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & photoalbum; -Export file is to be seen on the viewing side. download information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to see that all pictures of a party are obvious. for example, that all pictures of a party are obvious. at the moment, you can't use all pictures of a party. so you can't use this setting to hide certain images before particular viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why it has not been developed specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below the page you can set different resolutions for the images. in this way, those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures you can download the resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. it can therefore browse your pictures with low resolution, search for a lower transmission time. if he wants to see a larger image, it changes into a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose for all your HTML files, select a basic folder and for each subsequent sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the memory location. here you can select either a folder or by KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check whether they have been created for the basic folder a URL, after the pages have been created, the URL you specify here should be. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you have not been created in the final target file, you must manually copy them manually. this is the import function of the files, and this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The right configuration options have all three on basic folders or URLs. in these cases, a subfolder will set, whose name will set you in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are interested in a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum. if you have already checked your photo information, people on pictures, recording, etc., you'll need to make a photo album, you don't have to work with & make photo album; this work is not even done.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photoalbum, you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. these can be imported into your database with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. you differ in that file itself is stored in the file or whether the images can be stored in the file, that you can easily pass all the images in the file. the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the menu file Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for two times. first, the images that have indicated in the file of the .kim file, you will find the images of the URL that you have indicated in creating HTML files. this is, of course only possible if you have created your .kim file by using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">Following the following, the dialog for Export Pictures is described, which you can export about the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is intended to act internal or external .kim files. the following three selections are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you select Manually to copy the .kim file, you must copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copied to the .kim file, copy & album photo album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most pictures already are compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is not very small. if you want to compress the files, simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit a maximum picture size. if you would like to send your friends pictures, because the .kim file would be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image is maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you can select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the Menu Import, select & Buy photo album; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant for importing consists of four steps. first, you must select which pictures you want to import, after, in which folder you want to copy images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that, if you are interested in the category people of the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked for a database, where categories of imported file should be imported to which categories can be found in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In fourth step, you can download the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example for this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It needs to be easy to browse and watch images: if you look at pictures, you often want to view images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps from (1) to find information about your pictures, via (2) the review and view, until (3) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. but it has been extended and today, it also takes your videos. at many places in this guide, it will be talked about images, but frequently includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want to.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphoto album; lists the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future Starts automatically. if you want to start another database with images, you can start & album photo album; with option -c. as an example: photo album -c ~ / Company / Images / Images / Images / Images / Photo Album.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings' photo album; set up to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual will be explained to you the various settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you see six different symbols, with which you can call for the viewing and options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed support is available to the F1 key and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you as you can define different properties, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog, which is used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog box, you can set up complete member groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a cinema as in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the setting options, which are available to you for fixed the member groups. with the listed selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window half there is a list of the current category and in the right list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modular system means KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin Interface. download information here on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page you can call through the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with multiple applications, you can try to test these modules with & kphotoalbum; for this reason, you should always try to call these images using the command &gt; PhotoAlbum\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't tell you, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI, are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphoto album; not work. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications can not support their images in albums; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules that you can use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Here simulates & kphoto album; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all images that shows you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">Apart from the current album you have to have a photo album; the modules are also offered a list of albums. here is a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphoto album; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category is a record for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category which you have specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums, will be used, for example, if you choose the category people, will do & play photo album; so do if you were chosen to view this and add the module to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are removed with & photoalbum; you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select in the modules which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen when you start & photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see at the top of a menu and a toolbar. at the moment, it contains no more information about your pictures. at the moment we will see on this window, but now click on this window to show you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each picture with notes, where the image has been recorded individually or for a larger number of images certain comments on the same time. if for example, on all pictures of Jesper, and all images were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and Browse as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes if you can use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text field, by selecting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you can always use them again, if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the change of images within the list, if you are shown for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures of the same 5-10 people, you can find that the used names are postponed, which can find persons faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon to check out the list below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image, you may want to edit all the selected pictures and set these images with notes. click on the front and back buttons which are below the preview of the image right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries to once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all over the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">The picture shows a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to indicate that it is a special group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the related dialogs it is possible to add an entry into an existing or subcategory. in addition, you can also make an entry into a category or subcategory. attention, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically. see here.</seg>
<seg id="979">"" "" "" "you can move the individual elements of the note dialogs to form and postpone the bodies that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move it. you can also make a separate window by moving it out of the window range." ""</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs, click on the button Options... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also send a frame to it completely. if you want to see this window later again, use the button options... and then click on the window to view it. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you can view the entry pictures in your browser, you get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or all images you can't have a filter. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button, please try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is furnished as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this picture will be displayed in the image viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture preview. simply select the corresponding images from you and select either the remove key or select in the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photoalbum, which allows you to create a solution for this problem. you can also use the photo album that you may have saved on your hard disk. of course, you'll have to store images anywhere in the database. in the picture you can download the view of & PhotoAlbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, where the right upper corner is cut off, is not stored on the hard disk. this is, for example, pictures 1-9. however, the thumbnails are present, so that you can preview the preview of these images. you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you would like to see this, you need to copy files from the folders. if you want to avoid trouble as you want to avoid using your pictures, please buy a larger hard disk to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with your name privacy. if you want to remain a little more privacy, you can view the images that you can do for others to see and click on the menu. alternatively, you can also select all pictures you want to watch your little Sister everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This enables you to specify what images will be hidden in the case of the Fall. if you want to put the laptop to your little sister, simply select all the images that you have locked up, click on to lift the pictures again.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set this password, select password in your personal menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is not very secure. you can read or delete all images on the hard disk and the other can be able to read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only allowed to remove the password as unencrypted text; not very familiar with your photo album; not very familiar to stop the views of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and talk about hours of course, of course you want to look at any time. for this reason it has a picture _ and video viewer. you can preview it from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows the image, but additional information you can enter on the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox is on the upper part of the image you want to see and elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed on the viewer. all these options can be displayed in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here, see, matching entries to this show. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you have chosen persons from your browser and then Anne Helene is selected.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you load several pictures in the viewer, you can switch between them and go back by using the key image and skip down the picture. you can go to the first and last picture with Pos1 and finish. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can then run it as a slide show. then you can get a new picture after a few seconds. how often it can be controlled by clicking the Ctrl key and Plus or Minus. then the slide is stopped by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability to change the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer you can go into the image and zoom out into the image. with the Minus key, you can enter into the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and displays the result of the ZOOMS.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the equivalent button, the ZOOMS is shown that every pixel is equivalent to a pixel image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work in videos that are in and out with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can't turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can view images, you can find a picture with a person whose name you will have forgot to view this name. in the moment you can view the view and select the configuration dialog of the picture to view this name. but you'll probably prefer to mark the image and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see pictures on paper. in order to see which photos you want to start the viewer and see it as good or bad, while you see one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features, while you see them. features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you can press the appropriate letter. in view a picture, where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have added features to your pictures, you can view all the pictures you edit, print or whatever you have selected, so do you want to use one module to copy the selected pictures to a CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>

<seg id="1042">If a picture is saved with only one beam of pixels, there can be different mistakes. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or stuffed effects in curves and lines, besides that they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses an technology called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general, pictures with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch off anti-aliasing, connects and connects & Povray; more than a beam of pixels. this technology is a super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard, an adaptive, non-reitalic method; adaptive because every pixel is adaptive and adaptive because each pixel is always further divided and adaptive because the record depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray of pixels. if the difference between the values specified in pixels will be set to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated for a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceed the prespecified threshold, then the pixel will be followed up into 4 subsections, which can be followed individually and can be adjusted to other subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the Aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. when you switch Jittering, change & Povray; rays a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, if the associated beams have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore better nails for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross your detailed projections for extended projections, all projections are used. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives better rapprochement for projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>

<seg id="1077">So you just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start with more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you can follow all steps in this guide, you should get the ultimate but easy scene: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully, before you complain about it as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't add light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all flawlessly installed, see the first boot from & kpovmodeler; the following preset window rules:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation, so you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry to delete.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera is watching the whole scene you can create. in particular, this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. when they click on it, you can find the content of the viewproperties found in which the different parameters of the camera. in the user documentation of & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but please note that the camera is in view control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on a checkpoint and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you turn the button or press the space button, the wire-model views and the object tree immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could add an angle (insert the body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a permanent method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite layer as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the plain in the object tree, change the name and press the button address or the space bar. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view also shows the plain, even at the moment only as a limited scale. if you render the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you see the object tree accurately, you will see the different parameters of the property. in this case, you will find the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just pick the floor to place its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something single in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialogue will open in which you can select as the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the property tree. you can preview the name in the self-view pane (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button look like the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment displays only a matt black material, because you can still have settings for the pigment. remember to check the look of materials at any time with a click to preview. also, there are many options, but now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on Quader and ball, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you rename your picture with a click on the icon, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color name. you need to specify two new attributes. in the color list, select two new attributes. then select this entry twice (you can do this also more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select any color in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">"" "this step should simply be able to execute the basic work of & kpovmodeler, as you should have understood the basic work of & kpovmodeler; it's just as easy as the ground can be created:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object characteristics, you can immediately change the settings. put the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the bullet or push the button contact with the bottom. otherwise, the ball will float above the ground as you have shifted the floor to a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering is now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball is like a matt black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball you can now assign a material now. as already in the floor, enter the sphere a pigment than color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the name of the object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on a sphere of Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to introduce some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen shots and click on address or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of gloss effect and reflection showed some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of these options, which offers you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a RENDER method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you encounter a scene raytracts, the Renderer hypothetical rays coming from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes in the scene and how atmospheric effects are reflected in the scene and like an atmospheric effects such as fog. so the scene pixels for pixels is processed.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene is to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>

<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump-Map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic objects are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic objects. these models are then continued to give them a more realistic look.</seg>

<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be given to each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts enable the run of external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is used mostly. this way, dcop &gt; is relatively easy to be called. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; send messages to all the scripts. in this reason, strings have to continuously monitor their standard input and react appropriately to events. of course, a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While activation only needs to be made (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found), after the daily use of a & CD. this leads (hopefully) for understanding the slender approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble on the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert many formats - depending on which codec programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from FreeDb from the internet or can completely work without network, where everything is collected manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a brief list of the main window commands. on the page step by step guide you will find further information such as this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starting on request, the CDDB request of the CD data is available on request in the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, in the last case, first connection to the Internet.)</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the settings dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, Piepsen) for program events (like reading the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiores; with different maps (such as Encoder, to set the Encoders). here you must go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, codec and compression ratios and helps you with the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there is also other like 'shorts' or 'Monkey', which may possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">In the audio formats supported by data compression, depending on your psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG files are the most common. OGG may today have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences are less important because both co-quality produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not such 'freely, lame will still be included with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality of lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG recordings is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - when music is also heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB Stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset Standard' = This setting should usually offer transparency to most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hifi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR shared stereo, compress rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good gends for music by young people, portable devices and car parks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Erane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without consideration to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are entered manually or by the program automatically from FreeDb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can transfer / used to produce the folder and file names and the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms there is often a combination of program settings for the coders and these parameters here. the manual or the aid to the encoders explain the switch to these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: tag) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocan be added; the result looks like this:... -tt {title}... '.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiores; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDb is: a free database to read / enter the audio CDs that you can download / enter the audio CDs instead of yourself in the calculator. it's to note that all the other information can be downloaded into the computer. it's to note that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc., not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Ueberaster) is not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; besides, the information can be added to the music company any more or less worthless, so can neither the artist nor the music company can be added any more anyway by a & CD; business, physical or virtualization.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiogens; is active in a check box. for use FreeDb can be used with another (counterfake) address as the system used in the system. in this kind of configuration, it appears, but the e-mail address is not used when calling the server (This can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries, there are copies of the main database. if & kaudioops; for use FreeDb, the geographic should be used on the next surrounding mirror. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servern for online demand of & CD; information during reading a & CD. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which program is used to save pieces from the & CD; save into WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"" "" "" "there are rumours that it wants to know cdparanoia, search in the source code.... It was always the best choice for reading Audio CD. to note is that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet been done." ""</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read-out WAV files, the Kodierer can and thus select the desired file format. at the first time, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression of audio data) can be added to the tab of the code. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer Package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution, before the Kodierer can be used. this is also necessary for predefined coalers. more information about Kodierer are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, you can get more information about his switch by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many reasons. check the device of the device format of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading real of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to run both programs with a command line in a terminal block. that could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD. check out the sleeve & CD. this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter by step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still unsure to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will make enough information to set up those areas, which make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to read all and our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">Cdparanoia and lame have already been installed on your computer. both programs should be provided as a compiled packet for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you own screenings (eg; by trying to copy them into account).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers basic setup of & kaudiogens; something which probably is done just once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD, which must be repeated for any exiting & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the required codeserer for compression of music (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps) and which is used as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). because we are lazy, we share the program using the FreeDb to download the & CD data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change a & CD at any time, if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The equipment name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / scores.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device title of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, there is also a look at the file / etc / steer and an attempt to use the existing entries for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map Card General Settings. here's not much to do. here, an additional conversion will be defined. in our example, everything will be shown so often as shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just ask for incomplete information, so you will be informed when details are missing to testify (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortably and let the & CD data automatically download via the Internet from a FreeDb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected to the Internet while reading & CD, so that he can access the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, will be a & CD; entry is found immediately, when you're unhappy with a low risk, if you want to change easily. the directory entry / filename is changed with Conquorder - &gt; rename it and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example is further to note: if you want to manually enter the selection fields and FreeDb if you are using FreeDb in offline mode, if you want to use FreeDb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDb. these are settings for the data request, for the retrieving the & CD. how does the system know which data should get the CD? read the section on FreeDb. put it all as shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org site and look at a mirror server near you. this way the load is distributed between the computers. however, this setting will work as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls represent the protocol 8880 as default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD data to the FreeDb server. the first check box is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from your screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously intermittent pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one of the existing drive? paralleles reading and code? the author does not know, so simply try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last part: cross this to the & CD; discard the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you check this, then the path / folders can be specified, if only space on another drive can be created, the files will not be detected, if you do not want to make this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">To enter this as it is on the screen shot. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances anything must be blinded to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a very good audio quality, even for very good hifi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags, if necessary, for a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in your screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: at a DualCore or Quadcore or even a Multiprocessor machine can be tried to code more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiogens; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a & CD. if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described as the process of reading the & CD. we will build mp3 files. the folder structure, which is described in the previous section, as we are comfortably up and the & CD; data from FreeDb is described. the process of this section is described in this section, must be repeated for any exiting & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in FreeDb, watch the screen shots a little differently than the data for a & CD. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD, instead of removing them from the internet. comments will point out to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this sample is to be found. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not been done, then the & CD must now be defined in the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screen shot. this only if the & CD is identified as an audio CD, and it could be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then search the questions and answers to the previous post or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD was successfully picked up from FreeDb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window built in, and you can select the database record that your opinion is best suited to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't select the check box for automatic query from FreeDb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings) can also be selected manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have any local database, but get the data from the internet you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in an input field 'Update title' unless you have a composition with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments inidiecell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of data from the FreeDb, the CD editor is not empty, but it's always a good idea to check the contents of the CD-Editors (e.g. if all words start with big letters or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area. if you have ID3v2 tags; this option is set up on the CodierererSettings tab; take a look at the section 'FundamererSettings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the code to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, obviously with the style of the exiting CD; this is not important because we don't transmit the & CD. for more information, go to freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD-Editors window appears and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece will be in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from FreeDb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected so selected. make sure all the pieces are selected, or pressed the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was launched by clicking on the button selection menu, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with the orders and pursued.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the riders in order to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece will be read on the hard disk. the status of the program is shown in the left bottom of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will look if you are trying to work with a codec, which you don't have installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target file are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The mission 1 reads the first piece out, it is finished. however, we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus, please contact the status message in the lower part of the window, it's now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration settings to read this behavior. the only thing that appears to be configured, is the result unclear. the machine used with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code (from two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the body. after the last piece is coded a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiogens, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1651">The temporary collection may not be deleted. however, it doesn't matter if they are saved during leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General-MIDI compatible. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events were translated into events that understands synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in the Type Change patch to Trumpet type when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is no programms to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece of play.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. requirements for this is, however, that any occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send your map file as e-mail to me in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the Patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard. General use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all sounds that supports this instrument, if your keyboard is not supported (e.g. with sound 60), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun shot. to do this, please bear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is now a note with Patch 127 (riflation), patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the concept drum patch of the patch, there is a different Perkussioned instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;), and not the one, where the sound is the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify the sounds on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with PATCHMAP -section the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form sounds on the perkussions Channel. watch as an example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to modify some channels to other channels. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply make it easy in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, you'll need to use the keyword option for this canal! if you are trying to change the Forcepatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the Perkussions Patch on the Perkussions Channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio are multiplied by the value of Pitch-Bender events. if so, an MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event, it will be used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only relayed. the value 4096 is used to get in the map file no decimal komash.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM prepares that a keyboard, which will play a Pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards, however, try to play a bit higher up to an octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canal view is a window with a whole series of Klaviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these charges you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the canal view to change the instrument on a specific channel. if you have changed a tool, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to view the played sounds. select the view on the Settings menu under the Point of Channel: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD displays speed to play with which a song is played. the higher the number, the larger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. if you find, a song is too fast to change the text, you can slow down the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played. it contains the music, the speed, & etc. it can result in two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; they have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; it has happened because & kmid; without AWE support compiles. to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't have a desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & Conqueror; choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activate the automatic addition to the collection. otherwise the files are added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can push the arrow keys on the left hand side by Tempo- LCD. to restore the default tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have been on a & kde; -Desktop a & Conqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; if I want to play a karaoke file or I want to play a file, just into the & Conqueror; window, and select the desired file into the window by & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file, if you want to add them directly to a collection, turn the setup Automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. Zuonly you want to play the first file. so add the setting automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join us to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank all many thanks! if I see this songs or see the postcard, animated me, continue to program & kmid; program.</seg>

<seg id="1721">Another tool to debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output from mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. everything must be configured via manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc. here is an example of like a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>

<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support can only use Xvideo (probably this kind of playing of video devices under Linux) it should also work on the first screen (: 0.0) for the X server. this is why the videoforlinux server must be functional for the X server. this is why the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name of the place will be used for the defining of the font. it enables the font to be specified for the main text, the rules and notes.</seg>
<seg id="1775">By calling & kile; there are two choices for selecting: 1. the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document and bonding settings. 2. the document can be written down by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font. the font is not defined at the beginning, this may also occur in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has to be compiled the & latex; source code is compiled. the easiest way to use is to use the menu building or the button.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Once the wizard was entered a bit text, a few adaptations should be performed for the better readability of the document. at least a quote, a few places in fatty and cursive printing and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Strg E can be turned back to the editor (in the internal viewer). in an external viewer, the window will be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a different file format (engl. D e V ice I ng). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screen TVs.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as possible for the creation of the document (see). on the 7th step - you can print a document by clicking on the button (see if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar encourages the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source file was created, the conversion into the toolbar can start in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The precondition is to encourage the direct jump from the editor to the added position within the DVI; file.</seg>

<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either a existing & tex; - / latex; file can be created or created a new file. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a new document, some fonts can be replaced by other data (e.g. name or string coding). these variables can be set up in settings Kile... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">In creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which character strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $: this string will be replaced by entering the document class. typically it will be used as follows:\\ documentClass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {Article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the instructions given in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can use your own template instead of standard equipment.</seg>

<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main advantages when using a program such as & kile;. although & Kate; important functions for writing a & latex; product textures were added in & styles; special commands for their selection. under Edit menu, the following commands are included in text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are a complete paragraph (batch of rows that contain an empty line). this advanced importance is meant with the tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source textures. the only insignificant thing in & kile; is that the breakdown can be separated by two empty lines.</seg>

<seg id="1955">Automatic detection of accent characters: controls the automatic transformation of accentuated characters in corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes to detect various types of files. using the standard default, default conditions can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created or in other way than with open-open files (where the encoding of the file can be passed), however, this setting is sent out by the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files or for files whose DTD is not detected. however, this setting is transmitted from the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantilus; creates regular backup copies, so that in a power cut or crash when the program can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. also, a backup is made regularly, according to the set time, created.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or your own view (or documentation in a cartographer) which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code simultaneously.</seg>

<seg id="1973">For & quantilus; from version 3.3, the debugging was completely redesigned. (3) debugger was adjusted, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept has been implemented, which enables different implementations to plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, supporting the use of & gubed; inquantilus; add.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-ins in the project settings. with the button options besides the debugger plug-in selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantilus; -interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that is displayed in the contents of supervised variables. appears normally in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all grips are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appear in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output is shown (as in HTML) of the debugger. usually it appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, made, or it divides the plugin with when a project is opened when a project is opened, so that a debugger does not need to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart for debugging session Starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the leaves according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to view a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the debugger edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points out the debugger, with the execution of the script and to send information about the supervised variables as well as the current status is continued, when the script continues, the script will start before a debit memorandum starts, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points out the debugger, with the execution of the script, without information to supervising variables and the current line number. if this is done, the execution comes further. when a debit is given, the version begins as soon as a requirement is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger guides the next statement in the script without entering the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger guides the next statement in the script, where possible in functions and includes errors.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points out the debugger to overpass the order and go to the next so as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the supervised value appears in the variable view.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to customize & quantilus; can be adapted to your needs and as you are & quantilus; help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editierpackets (DTEP; s) are used in & quantilus; they enable & quantilus; ability to make support & quantilus; your simplicity and flexibility is made of & quantilus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for webdeveloper, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages and the toolbar. tag folders contain two file types, the text and descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars (above the editing window), insert text and instructions faster into a document as a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">DTEP; s can be used hanging (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details for conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the file descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) will define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featuresus; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars enable a quick insertion of tags to a document without a threat of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. you only contain the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the writing language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declared whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and borders will be explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur once in one document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains only nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The tags type is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid for the TagType Class only. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only for the Type Method only. returns the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Does a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; Tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tags. this element can only be used once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attributes. additionally, it contains further tags that will describe how this attribute is to appear & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Releases the source code used for filling the attributes in tag editors and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantilus; is used for reaching the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology name inside & quantilus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a methodology name. the arguments that will be handed over to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, meaning the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that grouped the elements of a list. it can only occur only once. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog. this day can only occur every attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that make a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; -declarations start: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly edited and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but respect & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML files is the tools dialog above in the & quantilus; window to start and check the TagXML. a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. at present the review will only be performed at the loading of the TagXML files in & quantilus;</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schematic day.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP will be described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0 =" UTF-8 "? &gt; & lt; tag name =" overload = "function _ name" type = "string _ name" type = "string _ name" type = "option" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is equally simple, and there is one editor that can be reached via DTD. thus, diedescriptionrc; for one out of a list selectable & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; it should be created for a new & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = use 1 for & quantilus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can be set with Settings Actions... click to Create new action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">"" "this action assigned to the button. with clicking on the user button one button can be assigned a button." "" "the current button is removable." ""</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be typed in the detector settings and in execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that will change or use the document (or parts of the document), but are the quickstart -dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document it will be file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantilus; only one instance is running, the text will be used to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantilus; the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, normally the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods can use a script input from & quantilus; to default. in the selection box input can be specified to specify what to default. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected field of document will be sent to the script. the% input variable normally makes sense with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">Accordingly input can also be redirected to the output issue. there are two types of issue: normal edition, written down to the default output. it may be specified when the default output is to be done by selecting the select box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. in this case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all the necessary fields and add them to the suitable tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag attributes and you plan their use, enable dialogue "tag" call, if available, so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly icon. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & kmenu;, graph further programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol is not only helps to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I have chosen to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will usually be interpreted as a symbol), or should at least an message to the user will be signaled; it is ready to add a message to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be linked to the action. this happens through the menu with Settings Actions... (in & quantilus;) and Selection of the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button button and continue to continue with other tags, so there are or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantiaplus; functions for tool bar supplement or it should be adjusted for a better overview by some Trento. open the toolbar to set dialog via Settings tool bar. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenner (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is added to the tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick possibility to access the Conqueror preview. I'll choose it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the dividers do not support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & Conqueror; -button is the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proving all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be stored in the right folder but your toolbar should be stored in the right folder, so that their tool bar (s) will be loaded, if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantilus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formattation language, which you like a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantiaplus; -Repository if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then, you have to let the docrc file. first part we will leave you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # 1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree. for example, you can now see in PHP & PHP; documentation is:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = index.html Getting started, # Language Reference Table = Basic syntax = Basic syntax = Basic syntax = basic syntax = language.basic synchron.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting started and Language Reference. this shows that it is a subfolder in tree with private content. there is no known limit for chess sets (except the reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consistent with the upper end of the tree view & mdash; files will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative & quantilus; Resourcendfiles are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section section is the section of docrc file, which is to be displayed in the context of the context-sensitive help. for example, if writing a & PHP, documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array parameter is to be displayed. there are only two types of entries here. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connecting lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc / $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / Posta / doc / $KDEDIR / doc / Quanta / doc / accommodation / doc / accommodation / doc / accommodation / doc / accommodation / doc / accommodation / doc / accommodation / doc / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / Posta / doc / Visa / doc / Quanta / doc / accommodation for local or global use. then create a folder in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you're sure that these good and it are worth shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation is used to use the & quantilus; -organization. they will not be rich, but are proud to have worked with the best web developer platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantilus; you are not alone. it is possible to divide the resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise to whom are sent. at different places we send an email, toolbar tool with email, the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all the others & quantilus; -users can be reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and usable for the publication, for what it is guaranteed to use a GPG / PGP key, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When charging, you are asked for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have more keys. in the dialog new resource, the input fields must remain empty) and then click OK to start the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can upload the DTD DTD package (DTEP), and upload toolbars from files and folders in templates and scripts in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantilus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the Signification. in case of problems, and it may be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the statement of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantilus; but it can be time consuming, because hundreds of tag files can be required in tagXML format. it gives the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into an DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. choose the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition line: the string that in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / Loe.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantilus; by converting the & descriptionrc; Editor, with the details of newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantilus; there are some key concepts. to understand these and fully benefits from & quantilus; this chapter is to bring to them perfectly with these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantilus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantilus; the working range is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantilus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantilus; uses, available. by toolbars, it is stored in the common folder structure of & quantilus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different materials, actions and patterns in global tree, which can be provided in any user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so it can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. all elements are used in the folder-tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantilus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the builders, the container walls, with information and toolbars. please suggest in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>

<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantilus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which it is used. the category depends on & quantilus; the category depends on the relevant user and templates in projects are available only in the project. more to templates can be found in this category.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of the integration in global, local and project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can check the information available to a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script can start, edit or send us using email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on the element of an element, the cursor is opened to the position of the element. by Right -clicking a element, a list of commands can be opened in terms of navigation and recording of the tree.</seg>

<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled in the best from above to bottom, as after completing the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project can be completed later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. in the input of name file the file will be completed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantilus; project file. by default it has saved the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the repository.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine where you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.examples) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If this field is empty, the default settings of the selected protocol can be used. depending on the remote machine setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2165">This option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to credit.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. one can select the desired files by Anhaken or, by removing the bunny, clutter from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings which can simplify your work. these settings can upload or upload using the project Properties in the menu pane or using the shortcut Shift; F7.</seg>

<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and password. this possibility is useful if frequent uploading of files is needed and the rather unsafe password on the disk option is not found in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog, if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantilus; can be uploaded to various servers and uploaded to a project (or parts of the project) to various servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied. either a full qualified domain name or an IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this doesn't have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate any service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your angst wave, this is either a time saving function or a danger. use them according to your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it can't easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simply docking the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the project or project toolbar, accessible via attitudes toolbar toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantilus; with which one has most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantilus; to your own workings.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantilus; best used by the toolbar. use and add-out materials will be dealt with in the section addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the symbols are set to be adjusted in the toolbar (right-click on the toolbar), in which new toolbar can be adjusted, toolbar rename or toolbar, which can be specified in the dialog, which can be specified on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries to remove and action are displayed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings toolbars... and settings can be set...</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential documentation, code schnitzel and files to the link. & quantilus; used templates basically like a usual file system with expansive organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory in the paddock. templates have in & quantilus; in about the restrictions you need for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantilus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binaries is all that is not pure text. it can be added any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. some examples are displayed in documents under global templates (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). more information about the template is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text documentation. on the basis of this templates, you can create a simple framework for the purpose and organises work in appropriate ways to be efficiently. some examples may be found in the preventive room under global templates. see for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful, if not a new document needed on a template but the same text area to be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a detailed menu system to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. see some examples in the preventive room under global templates. see for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates for all websites are used as templates. they are a collection of different documents which can be combined in a folder tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantilus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as desired (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File as a template as your local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the project room under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click here to save selection as local / project templates. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and dragging on the template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be downloaded in a preset folder, such as drag and drop or inserting through the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">One can select a folder right in the file tree or in the project files building manview, select a name for the template and secure a name for the template, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very targeted way-oriented approach. you can create header lines and footer, or dynamically, create files, or link them with them. in addition, you can create some things using using templates in projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The substructure in the subwindow templates are based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder you can click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu features. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is hidden, as soon as terterous attributes is bent.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts for everything except the stem files. if a master folder would be set off, it would be explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text block. if nothing appears, it is probably in a master folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows four or recreated text for templates in this folder. this could be general header lines or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip a folder with special header lines / footlines a whole presentation with matching headlines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we have a context menu (showing right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantilus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source text editor that are accessible via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source pane in two parts: the code editor and the VPL code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it is a document like a normal & HTML; - or XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit it and when needed for source code editing in the VPL; Editor is visible in the sourcecode.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; it shows a small green symbol the Vohandroid of & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; it is still necessary to edit it directly with the VPL; it is still no plans to modify this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time, the cursor is active in both the source code and in the VPL; editor synchronously runs. with pressing F9, this mode is already active, the button push the active cursor from a window to the other, where the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta.... In addition, you can choose between synchronization to one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be set automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small range for fast calculator and a wide range for slow PC.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the documentation of invisible tags in working with VPL; it is also called once a new document with the VPL; editor is created. that is to change the suspension of the wagging code. that can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta-Elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list enables the change of the contents to e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword keyrt2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the design of pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules to the list below the list or delete a change over the list of meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is like in a text processing, because of the arrows, possible. the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing or remover.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be made in the same way over the toolbars, such as in the source code editor, which is already existing in the source code, e.g. if an anchor tag, enclosed with text, must be removed every other re-anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables-assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists have to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining stylized styles. in contrast to other programs, search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style can be followed.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; you need to compile it out except & kde; nor the libraries libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already existing in a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Halt in a template, on one spot in one of xsldbg charged Stil- or xml file or at the current nodes. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode, it can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg determines the full path from a file name without scouting. filenames in the same folder as the top-loaded stylizer file named xsldbg is used for example a stylistic file.. / en / xsldoc.xsl, the following input is possible:</seg>
<seg id="2231">In this command, a partial or entire agreement with a demonstration called QNAME or a specified Modusname is checked. & eg; template is right with any QNAP template containing the character template.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"" "" "" "the merge was very complicated because there has been a lot of changes at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of changes in the same file." "" "" "" the result was a lot of conflicts in the same file. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had been changed within these lines. and there was no indications in the places where maybe only the retrofit had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could mark differences within a row and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions have been added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare text quickly, just copy it to the clipboard and add it to one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the comparisons and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way merge is also supported. this is useful when two persons work independently in one piece of code work and make changes. the interaction editor allows you to edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the photo picture shows three quell-files when using:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the same and merge folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and ensembles the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble if nobody changes the retrofit).</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the others differ in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders then you can complete the typing work by using only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 2 (Folder 2 Folder 2-o target folder kdiff3 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 Folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open-dialog gives the manual typing of filenames, the selection via the file browser (file...) or the elect of a last opened file in the list box. you don't need to specify a third file when you leave the record for C, the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, then select the default or merge folders. if you select a file, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merge is crossed, the input field is active for the target and it is not necessarily required to specify an output file. you can finish this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set button will open a dialog with Settings. here you can specify Options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard to the active comparative window. in the open dialog you don't need to select files, simply connect the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and lay down: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall through a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind? it contains a file for example several similar functions. if you want to figure out what is similar to these functions, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to compare two corresponding files, they would just copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: you can't find out anything from & kdiff3; only the antennas of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insertion of text into another program as cutoff and insertion (instead of copying and insertion). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info-line has a different color. (if the path is too long, let the mouse rest a while on line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees the color that file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summarizing column. when differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. with some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are only in character and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare items relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summarizing column from the text, where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks is enabled, the line is scored on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative windows) also has an Info-line with the inscription:, the filename and [Gechanges] if you have already processed the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, Save is disabled!!! (use buttons to be closest / unresolved conflict to find even remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, every difference is to be replaced manually in the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group's column in all windows is marked, and the first line of the group will be shown. this group will then be shown in the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background colour for current area and the left appears on a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic merge or through manual editing, no more line is left in the group; it's only a placeholder for the case, that you may change your mind and perhaps another source code. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marking which you may copy and add it elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge operation; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the images, but you can also use the keyboard, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are used in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys, right, end, string early and Ctrl-end, Sibas can also be used by other programs. if you can also navigate to the navigating column, you can also click navigating.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. with insert button, you can switch between plug-and overwrite mode. (default is the plug-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as described in the section merge and editing the output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the next / last / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-pictured downwards) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-pictured downwards) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-pictured downwards) or to the next / previous conflict, even after manual release, must be distinguished between dissolved and unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the marking into the clipboard, you'll need to automatically copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this option is enabled, automatically copied to clipboard and remove manual copying. be careful with this option but if you could accidentally write the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line versions are stored according to the underlying operating system. unix variants use a line-in symbols\, and Win32-based systems use line-in line\\ r\. KON3 does not retain the line-files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start. (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a script with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose, but you shouldn't use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in italics are displayed. if the selected script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered to the button default settings automatically an unregulated color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the tab button inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. copy the manual to the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer. the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same of files, & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines can be found in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. in this step, white signs will not be ignored. even when merge, white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a wagon backdrop '\' at the end of a line, but then they could only store a line-in '\'. if this option is enabled, however, this option will be disabled. during the merge, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis figures and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '-') will be ignored. however, the differences will be displayed nevertheless, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively search for smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective with complex and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic-forward mode, this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection is displayed, before the next unresolved conflict is injected.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters by selecting the selected file as a source. (default is useful if white characters occur in many files, if you only need to ignore the functions Wähle A / B / C for all uneldest white conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options are enabled or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in Chapter to scan folders and merge a merge. see for details on documentation to compare and merge tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version will be the suffix .original version. if already such a backup file with the suffix .original, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need & kdiff3; stop and restart. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; it is not available because the language is defined globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you use this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection fields for coding, a short notice, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and for you are pure informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you edit a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you may not work with your codec. (for example, your files could not work 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing warrant can only be set with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the coding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off this to suppress differences of changes in white characters in text or considerations. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options may ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This choice is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all the differences between two of three files will be shown. however, you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. by selecting A & B; -gt; C or B & lt; C, C or B & lt; C is displayed next to the normal or second column-column with the information required.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply use the less important window. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison window by side or above each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide if you're using only two files. a simple click will work when using only two files. (if this function is used to run the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it becomes visible to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command itself is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that is exactly your requirements. for example, you can extract this function, e.g. for release disturbing parts or to correct insertion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is used only when using the line processing command. you can write your own preprocessor that is exactly your requirements. each input line must have an associated output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when enabling the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not wish to program this. the good news is, however, that in most cases Sed or perl are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">In this context, use this preset command for Zeiling to convert the input in uppercase letters: Sed's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ 's text string to the found text. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other versioning systems use a few key words to include files generated automatically (info: / cvs / Keyword Substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with Sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further pre-processing warrant for Zeila. Sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and any hits will be replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple tasks at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the requirements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of Sed you can also use something different such as perl -e -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'However, some details are different from perl. where Sed\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal premum are retained for display and merge. further operations change only the data, which sees line-equal algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off-processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you can't miss certain differences.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and interact with & kdiff3; complete folders can be recursively and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can adapt the suggestion before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the interaction, showing the simulated changes, without being able to accomplish,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads to selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparisons and merge of individual files. you only need to specify folder on command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder is used as a base. if no target folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will not start to run the merge, select the menu entry or press F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the read of the folder you will inform a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the file scanning, only the files are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is complete, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder used during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded together. you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu includes two functions, and all subdirectories can open up with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file will start immediately and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action can not be selected automatically. if the merge is launched, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns above.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In case of identical entries the colour is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if you are identical to the entire content. then folder is the same color. during folders the age is significantly lower for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colours of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the goal, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the goal, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the goal, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B file is): errors: conflicting data types. as long as such bad objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B file is): errors: conflicting data types. as long as such bad objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folders are specified. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action is identical, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: merging and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after the merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders can be merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsure), then & kdiff3; the date of files are different, but the date is identical, but the date is identical.. As long as such mistakes are not removed, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file is executed after the other. a status column indicates that when the merge has been successfully, and when the merge is complete, you should take a final review and see if the status is fine everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in setup dialog, the file comparative analysis is selected, KDiff3 will display further columns. these include the number of unmolars, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (column for dissolved conflicts is only shown if three folders can be compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either result in either selected entry (file or odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (even in all underordings), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a target folder, then the three-folder merge mode is used as target, when the two-folder merge is used as target and when synchronize, A and / or B is used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries should be displayed in the target file, even in the folder structure, there are some options that could be skipped in order to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring back all the entries: select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to carry out only the current entry: choose action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory data types still exist, a message appears to be found on the defective elements. they can then select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options, ejaculating and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you would like to see what would happen without which really changes will be made. you will receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual interference is necessary (combined with a single file), then a merge window will open (see the picture photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select again directory entry / continue, or press F7. if you are not saved, an appropriate dialogue will appear. then leads & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; put on a mistake, a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you have the chance to select a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before using the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you'll notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and execute all entries not again. even if the merge action has been taken or not saved, these entries will be performed once again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files which are shown on the specified pattern will be shown in the element-tree. separating the pattern with a Semikolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .cpp; * .h). the default is not to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern will not be shown in the element-tree. it can use more than one pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern will not be shown in the element-tree. it can use more than one pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files which will also be ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set specific with a .cvsignor file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignor.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystem files, files have a default attribute. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: when the option is shut down, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to the links. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In the links to the folder: if the option is switched off, the links will be compared and recursively. (note that & kdiff3; no link to a folder that may result in itself would lead to an end loop and dediff3;) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Does a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics of statistics. (the number of dissolved, non- white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when used to files, which contain no text. (give an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster, just compare the change date and the file size. please use a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidential expiration date. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered identical if the copying date is lost. please use caution when copying the amendment date. please be careful with caution. this option is under default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating synchronizing mode when two folders can be compared and no target folder. in this mode, the proposals are identical to the merge. also, the results from merge files are stored in both folders. this option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, it is suggested to copying the newer file as action. (this is considered unsafe because the other file is not changed too.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted, the original version will be renamed. if an old backup file is already deleted, it will also be deleted without another backup. this will also refer to the normal association of individual files, not only the merge whole folder. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folders-merge pane stays visible with the mouse button. if you don't like that, you can switch off the folder directory in the window menu, and switch to switch between directory & text windows between the two opinions.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably, you prefer to compare a file simply by double click. however, in the directory menu, you can use a single file directly, but if you save the result, the status will be done directly, and the file will not run once again when you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost when you read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. this way, you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line represents a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">One URL has another syntax for local files and folders. a few things should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively poor. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process authorization or change date. therefore, remove the permissions or modification of the original. (note the option confidential.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of purpose is to start in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first starts to launch the built-in differences. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in Kdiff3 from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needs & kdiff3; two full input files, however, takes & kdiff3; if the input file is used in unified format. then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch is to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview - KDiff3Part. please note that it does not work if none of the original files exists. in addition, it is unreliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heet compresses) is already available. in addition, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it may lead to the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that have gone or so will go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from sources, and the configure script probably does not have the right prefix to KDE, but then KDE will not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you can find further information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be regarded as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is considered not identical. if the lines is next to any other, this is cooperated but this is cooperated.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noted for each difference in the files where he starts and where he ends. this important information is simply lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a file format which could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too large so far. you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly missing; no src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does it mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; use many colors for emphasise differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes in http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the changelog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To build & kdiff3; compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the basic folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder to your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake uses, you should not have any problems at compiling. should be difficulties, please tell the & kde; -mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cutout (Ctrl-X or Shift) copy to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insertion (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) adds the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaced the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to relocate the folder with the function update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to show the differences. this also causes the identical files in conjunction with the target folder. if the target file does not already contain these files, it will not be modified in a later program version.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are attached to one of the selected window, the lines will be attached to the selected group at the end of the selected group (if they are not already available), they will be back by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. understanding differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual areas. it is quite convenient to change the running programs on working areas to finish her size, or shift it. this works both within a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual areas as well as the applications running in running applications. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & kpager. motion is possible both within a desktop or on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & kpager, the context menu has been clicked only the symbol and the name of the application as well as the name of the application as well as the entries, maximize, desktop and commands.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of desktop. appears only when clicking on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to selected virtual desktop. appears only when clicking on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved within the & kamp; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, in & kpager; the names of virtual workspaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field makes the & kpager. display the numbers of virtual working areas. it is outlined with the name and enter the names with ordinal numbers, eg. 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is shown as background in & kpager. displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as a small window in & kpager; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to make their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is selected the view of the program window. simple and easily displays the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very quick systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & kamp; -main window can be determined: classic & kpager; in a 2xn rack, all virtual working areas appear in some other platforms; horizontally, all virtual working areas appear in a vertical range, which is very good for the presentation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, displaying the windows as symbols or with its content. besides, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; set up the switch from Switches... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this can not be changed in dialog settings, but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or VI. If you don't need to register as root or turn to your system administrator. in this file, you have to assign the key to windowtransparentmode and assign a value to this file.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & kpager; part of the package is, you need a working installation of the KDE base package.</seg>

<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on digits in the Browserwindow that do not display a link, do not allow the mouse to park in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is bucks, you should clean your mouse. it's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to remove the mouse hemisphere. as it happens, it is different from mouse to mouse. but it should be quickly clear when you see the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball removed, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the Loches where the ball was used. dirt and dirt can easily scrap easily with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the design of & kmousetool; if you're just a shift in this case, this means that & kmousetool does not mean that & kmousetool; the operation is no longer able to end the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click. herein, the status of & kmousetool is reset; reset and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and establishes the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to place it. but if you do not want to make a mouse on a neutral field of mind. safe zones for the mouse pointer and eg. safe zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbar and the titles of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with smart shifting, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time to copy it in this way. it is very likely to copy it to the clipboard and move it again, if you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. but there will probably be problems with them. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent move, if you just start using & kmousetool; click on the one end of the text area a mouse click and hold down the Shift key, while you move the mouse to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will be any time when & kmousetool; the Maubutton starts playing a sound like a mouse click. then you can use the intelligent move without the audible mouse click here. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X window; it should be installed on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse is only available if the system features a sound card and speaker and has been set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; operated by the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor briefly. this program has been designed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and those of the bridal vertebrates are processed.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process before the mouse button will start. in this way the drag and drop is carried out with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces serves to manage network systems of the system. all available network devices are displayed. on the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button... in the dialog device can be processed.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button to set the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection of Automatically, TCP / IP settings are taken using a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP information will automatically send all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start, therefore no further option is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP may be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP configuration may be specified. in the input field IP address, the required TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initialize the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as Properties of the device in the device box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address is not used in the network. entering an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict. you can find whether the required address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network appliances can be activated or disabled depending on the need. turn on a network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network appliances can be activated or disabled depending on the need. switch off a activated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and by clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Establishes the IP address of the host in local subnet, which provides physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A calculator with DNS support replaces complete IP address. this is necessary because computers only calls IP addresses. if the calculator http: / / www.einedomain.org triggers this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for naming the name of this list allows a simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed .DNS records can be reordered by selecting a contract and up or downgradation in the list with buttons up or down in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button you can add a DNS server to the name resolution, a DNS server can add a DNS server. it will add the dialog New Nameserver.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the button to add. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click on the Edit menu.... It will be displayed by the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of well-known computers describes hostname-to-IP address connection for the TCP / IP Subsystem. it is used primarily with boats when no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses will support them. this is still the current version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well known computer and click Add.... The dialog for the new alias add will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known host and click the button to add. if the well-known computer has multiple alias name, de button add several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select one entry of a well-known computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog's dialog is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">One of the following tasks can be executed, then with clicking OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not effective in the system. to activate the changes, must be set in a & console; the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready version is recommended for less experienced users. it is just the rpm package to download and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; you should compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be discussed, in the second, all are reviewed by & knetworkconf; amended configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information is conveyed via the integration of the PC in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are being operated using TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). from IPv6 it is expected to pass through IPv6 in the near future. this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign an IP address of a network interface. in external networks, on & eg; Workplace is the network administrator either hurting or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (Home) network, IP address should be used specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded, therefore, its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course the access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networking to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second most loopback address (localhost = your own calculator). the standard route is required for IP transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address of 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in its own machine. normally the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files, which are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file will sometimes be dynamically modified with DSL connections, so that if in case of active DSL connections, there is no other content than set there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is reassorted by scripts in SuSEconfig. another state can occur therefore.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a fuse program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the second goal was to answer a question for tar, which provided my wife: how much longer it takes?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it has to be integrated by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trains the band back and read the pretension of the tape. detects & kdat; if the spell in the band will not be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the procedure, looking for the right index on your disk. cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index will be newly created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, changes the symbol for the tape drive, to indicate that the tape has been incorporated into the status bar. the content of the tape can now be searched by selecting the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing off the belt, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; specifies a change in symbol for the band that the bond has been solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be kicked out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a volume of & kdat; it has to be formatted by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">One band types must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this procedure does not conform to the formatting of & kdat; this procedure does not have to be formatted before using the tape of & kdat; however, floppy tape drives are usually not formatted. DAT drives are not formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all the data on the tape is lost, the band is automatically mounted and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup procedure, you must select the backup files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in local file tree. it is secured only this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in a local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">With the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the Sheer menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was launched, the dialog for backup will open. in this dialog you can check once the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog appears secure. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or folder in one of the archive in record for the drive. it will be checked only the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archive for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders can be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry test....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been launched, the dialog appears for checking. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">"" "" "" "if you have confirmed the settings for review, the dialog appears to check out. this dialogue shows the progress of the test process and the data throughput and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can redirect the restore, the files that are to be recovered. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which belong to record for the tape drive. it will only be restored to select the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Mark the desired files from one of the archive with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">With the right mouse button, click a file or folder in one of the archives and choose to restore in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been launched, the dialog appears for restoration. in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the work folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoring, the dialog appears to restore. this dialogue shows the progress of recovery and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to create a reindexed file based on the tape. this procedure deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can carry out the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">"" "" "" "the current work folder where the backup is to be carried out. the list of the will be updated automatically according to the newly elected workfolder." ""</seg>
<seg id="2924">For any folder, which are listed under backup files, is that only the files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are displayed on other file systems. each entry is considered from tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is secured since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since last incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; s; and lt; files was not yet implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If the tape is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the load is connected to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, & kdat is trying to lock the failure at tape drive. possibly this setting doesn't work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the insertion of & kdat is automatically ejected. use this option not to floppy disk drives.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is on, tries & kdat; not all drives support variable blockage. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you'll need & kdat; in any case the block size will communicate for your band cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only be a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is machine name: seconds, with the name of the full name of the system is formatted on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar-archives created directly with & GNU; but tar can manage. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a cover tape. this symbol is only active if a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & knot; -viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for unexperienced users, where you can get information about your system or where the system enables quick access to information about problems, which occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what makes your calculator in the background. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored on the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog enables fast access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, attempts to provide some extended functions, which can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. among others include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions also include and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & ksystem log; functions are available, with their help you can easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol-file to sorting and filtering the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog is attempted to open the system protocol, and it will not open, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you'll normally do not get on system administrator. the protocol files usually have no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter out the filter bar in order to select a string into the filter bar. in the default setting, select the list box next to the selected filter. then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter keyword.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. select the column string of the filter keyword will then select the name of a process, and then apply the name of a process, and will show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines which have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default settings and helps you to identify the important protocol lines. note-lines of the level errors are displayed with a showless color than protocol lines. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), so you can select the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command like the start of Samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add-new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to use several protocol files in separate sub-windows. in order to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log in menu to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further information about the source Sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init develops rapidly for control the program starts when moving the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it's easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not enter into historical aspects here (such as I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binaries is below / sbin and not under / etc. it is therefore important because maybe someone could try to gain a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and new format. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service which you want to start off the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial that is only started once. such views are after rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be either under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it's not much use for it. you can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered / etc / inittany. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column, and probably determine that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix them by hand, then proceed to the system when you restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you don't find real files. instead, each entry is link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: every scripting is written that it's a argument like start and stop. you can actually launch this scripts from hand to command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. it reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will be hit with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could & eg; one server-Runlevel, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. also, I could even run a user-runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other hand-device is simple to say not to say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move the scripts between Runlevels or change the position within one level. this will not be removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only occur if you prefer an entry from the area of available services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed when you prefer this in a new area. to select them from the menu Edit or from the context menu, and then insert in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed before the action range.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Sometimes the sorting number of a single entry can sometimes be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are no possibility to restore records that were thrown into the Recycle Bin. so, be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different working ranges (check-level 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">In order to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the tabulator button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by typing the input button to accept or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are taken in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences will be taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be saved by & ksysv; reproduced. changes to preferences will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine launches new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in a single use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you have to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The method, such as system services in these distributions, is simplified for the proprietary software programs of this distributions, but is unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if any configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply without news, if its configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save this. either you use the appropriate symbol of the toolbar or the entry store in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy use. the main window consists of two card cards, user and user forces. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some map cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you have any wildcard settings, if you have individual settings, if shadow -passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears, if shadow -passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD universes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map card appears only if for at least an embedded file system placements (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quotas / quotas group on the file system). here, any user limits can be modified for each user.</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The maps Group informs groups of the selected users. the standard group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the Priminary Group field. furthermore, the user can join in other groups by selecting this in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog's dialog box contains a list of users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">In order to add a user or a group, select addition from the user or group or click the suitable addition button of toolbar. to edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can add the LILO-BootManager, remove and change the time to booting the default operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change systems, change, change, and more.</seg>
