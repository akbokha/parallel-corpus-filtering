although I visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceedingly great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have learned to American music , American authors read and operated .
in fact , this country had such a deep impact on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ tham in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter served with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura @-@ Student , who had inc@@ lined the Supreme Court to judge his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was it , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , its diversity is so inviting that you are ever and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had a very strange love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as it is surrounded with its narrow @-@ minded ness .
he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and explains publicly his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , Af@@ ro@@ American and women .
however , people responded to his testimony and agreed in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won by rep@@ ubli@@ can elections , was the highest number that won by the Party of nomin@@ ate candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that supporting this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters to meet the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , under@@ take people from all over the world , a deeply belie@@ ving man , with whom I could enter@@ tain me about Islam and its past .
the Tr@@ um@@ ps world view doesn &apos;t agree with the current publisher of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; Cincinn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ toler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
yet it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , were my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot at my career .
these people and those who em@@ bo@@ died values deep@@ ened my love for America .
during Tr@@ ump his way to nomin@@ ate rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and counter@@ part to its restricted vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or maybe due to its contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , broke my heart .
maybe it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a law@@ si@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is superf@@ icial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of which most white are , for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to recover the control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , hardly anyone can forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who gives the cruel decision to rise a man , look at contemp@@ t on those looking different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m . ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ation ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ inc@@ eption of white into play on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what &apos;s the great Van Jones called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did this great Van Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did exactly that which America did so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - what belief or background you may always have , America is welcome every welcome .
for this country chose the son of an Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with mani@@ fold , religious freedom and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of choice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on a rally of Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd answered with a loud voice , &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; did Lat@@ ino have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if anyone is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and powerful &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is this not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart to me .

what did the Mexican Music School of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero Church in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ian city Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
that the music that is played in both places is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , who lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby distinctive ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years , the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) is now playing in the municipality : one of the children and adults of existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra which has an opportunity for over@@ coming poverty .
a school of 100 students has become the central interest for the parish of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drug abuse and the gangs fire .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare hop@@ el@@ age .
the young band members take seriously their obligations towards the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from the school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to reflect their great passion .
they always come together and play with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you meet day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically above the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay , which are produced from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ opened instruments , made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recy@@ c@@ ler began to transform parts of waste in instruments .
the instruments were im@@ itated viol@@ ins , viola , c@@ elli , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , trumpets , trumpets and percussion all from the garbage .
the re@@ pertoire en@@ comp@@ asses classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez re@@ members a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura :
first , it was very difficult because we had no place for the rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked not any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was something shown that he had never seen before : a violin was produced .
today there is an entire orchestra which is based on instruments made from recycled material and joins The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world produces approximately one billion tonnes of tr@@ ash each year .
those who live with him and of him are the doctors , like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectac@@ le from garbage to music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that specifically talks about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication happens within the framework of a Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of Content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing waters before it was searching other coast of Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the East African countries were thus un@@ til@@ ted and slightly til@@ ted to welcome a bill of law to their co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ po@@ res , Mozambique and the Seychelles are quickly mobi@@ liz@@ ed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier surrounded by countries , which you simply refused everything &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch fish there .
in the end , it was forced to pay 2 million dollars to Liberia because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , to cross criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO Stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries stop ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries who had driven the Premier out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries to work and work together . they exchange information and stand up each other , where it is illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden because it is extremely difficult . this is illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem that have a delicate equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
but while actions against illegal fishing have been hin@@ dered by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ d@@ les , and through the snow @-@ emp@@ t@@ emp@@ o , with information between individual countries , these actions happen in real time , with tracking at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries , for example , exchange lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port inspec@@ tions .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move at the open lake , by satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships which fish in forbidden areas - such as susp@@ icious driving routes - such as such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such exam@@ inations can show if the involved ships have a fishing licence where they were on the way and possibly if they have a Criminal register .
countries that are against illegal fishing can be refused to accept such ships in their har@@ bours . what means that ships could not sell their cargo . and that they could even be forced to play against pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it &apos;s about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing are not fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that puts himself for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win a estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen that inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish in East Africa , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing industry . among these also the other illegal fishermen .
other practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , speci@@ fying fantasy species , fish protected species and fishing in protected areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal fishing and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has un@@ covered criminal networks that had spread counter@@ f@@ eit lic@@ ences in Tanzania . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it discovered ships who used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pursu@@ ing ships &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing via large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to get susp@@ ects ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be developed further will also help to hide the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ legal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we try to cross their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Che@@ f@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch for example their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be ge@@ d@@ led by satellites .
therefore , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it is said to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence the global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the marine protection organization Oce@@ ana the platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each tracking vessel worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neigh@@ bors , to get a better picture of it , who knows what is doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to join one and their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , where a global system allow@@ es persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only feeling crimin@@ als , but they also loc@@ ust@@ s .
ships that have been f@@ ished in earlier without license , and have hardly ever expected consequences , know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile buy a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats can buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had assisted Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board towing networks , their commitment is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also see these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa a year , several hundred million dollars will van@@ ish through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force , and now they fight against illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to allow even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s recent member of Somalia were able to sign his first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag . and not only the ship was travelling without license , which are now forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also dr@@ illed in forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such special , collabor@@ ative work will work on the whole world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the subject of the environment , technology and nutrition .
her articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , The New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to spread : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the proposal of opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venet@@ ians responded to negotiations on the political and economic crisis in the country by being assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the feedback from Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the land region of Bar@@ inas , in the an@@ den@@ iers MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally located Bun@@ dest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deteri@@ or@@ ated continually , which is noticeable in everyday life of Venet@@ ians by acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the counter@@ part of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro said the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Contri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government &apos;s context in its latest article :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ( the inflation rate ) for many as the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institu@@ tional structures and close a new govern@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral council of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ versi@@ dad ab@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( approx . : round table of the Democratic Unity ) , in which the opposition started to join the opposition parties and a march towards the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , on November 3 , should continue to continue the blocking of refer@@ end@@ ums to be continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26th .
the pictures of the fairy tale , which are published in real time , are overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most common pictures shows demonstr@@ ators that calls through the protective shield : &quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot;

particularly large waves beat the news about police re@@ pression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , to protect himself according to their own testimony before the police and armed conflict of the government .
hours later they managed to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police force , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear tu@@ ck because anything else could see what many national gar@@ den@@ ds don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic makes the turn that forms the extent of supp@@ ression per day :
so the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a term procedure - this has now been shown in the eyes of many of countless people in the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot;

they took us so much - but also the fear !

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , which was previously published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , a Argentin@@ ian message page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the at@@ ro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city CÃ³rdoba .
as an adult man , Qu@@ ij@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
the trial began on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano didn &apos;t choose his life .
starting with the burden of the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years , he kept family sec@@ rec@@ y for himself .
in the situation then I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child at 15 , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not realise that my father was a thief , fol@@ ks and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was a deputy officer . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 @-@ 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division in prison La Per@@ la .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano .
filing recording .
but this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , which is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ an@@ os son , a man who had witnessed over the years the extent of the at@@ ro@@ cities which he had witnessed a boy , and he said before a court against his own father .
his story shows that great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP .
pass just that they don &apos;t kid@@ nap you one day and I must save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the revolution@@ aries Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had raised me .
on the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university connections , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ and@@ am@@ at@@ erial , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ da@@ h the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos; .
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he had to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the car , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - all possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he gave me a little girl in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump in silver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects have been placed and taught me with an out@@ post .
suddenly he settled in an open room and said :
there will be tor@@ tured prisoners .
and I par@@ ked in , and saw a song that were tor@@ tured in men .
she looked like a field of field and metal springs .
later on , I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened at the body of the person that was just cap@@ tiv@@ ated there .
they rarely do a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , cast him with water and pursued a cargo of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was in it ... like a dirty wine .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in trouble .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible that a man can do so much harm ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were carried along .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , a civilian which was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were bound with the face down - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated at hands and feet .
near the entrance hall , people were silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you mean , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you kid@@ nap me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a d@@ unge@@ on , and were buried by soldiers .
I know that , because my father was told at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero proposed a man and killed there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survi@@ vor@@ s , the civi@@ lization , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted on La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , was also sentenced to death by students &quot; Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way , which you came in here , is also the way that the guided tours came here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path , and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they received a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ miner@@ alization .
if torture survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement came up from above that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of man and dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war of spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought all kinds of things to go home .
at the age of age I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils &quot; - how they called it - was .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that spo@@ ils have been a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military sign that one has been fighting with an enemy .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a spo@@ ils , but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked me how my father , the leader of the security forces went with this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would have never liked to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a crime , and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you , who beat cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded anger , beat me and cried , saying ,
when you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I finished in the process , I showed a photo of those that I had a jacket and a roll pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing to home .
back then , I accused the defence of being a fellow at this crime . I said , no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway to speak out .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last sh@@ ab@@ om@@ able act &apos;
now where I &apos;m older , I feel repent@@ ance .
I have children . if you first have children , one can recognize the value of a life .
it evol@@ ves and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were ex@@ iled during the dictatorship . but why do the bodies disappear ?
why children kid@@ nap ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always found the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could simply have put them into prison .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
had these people not too have families with which one could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ ror act that can do man to man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father told me when democracy was introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and never dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where to find . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you never said anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my Father .
the idea , to show my father , was born during a meeting when he was under house arrest .
I did acc@@ us@@ ations because of all the cru@@ ises that I had to deal with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt ri@@ di@@ culous and asked me , for what the whole ab@@ le@@ ver@@ ted patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended , actually were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you comp@@ elled me as a child to participate in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I reimbur@@ sed the first display .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can imagine that I &apos;m bi@@ ased . I finally said to my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 off@@ ences : among them serious , un@@ tim@@ ely freedom of freedom in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 , especially severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping one under 10 years of age .

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the particle to the size of the judgment .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process took place because of the crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 The op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity ; and the court found life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases of liability between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were also rele@@ asing .
eleven of originally 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ pet@@ ition : murder , torture and ra@@ pe through offices . # Ez@@ war@@ e@@ ror@@ ism
all the accused were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police members and civil employees .
Piero De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he judged the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historical milestone for all human rights organizations that have worked for years on justice for victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , established in 1995 , established by H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who had killed the children of men , who were murdered or missing during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 the Argentin@@ ean government transferred the country to himself to La Per@@ la , so that there was a memorial place , which is now led by human rights organizations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driving drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was spread in social media .
processing of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers were moved to a newly opened centre in which one can extend his leadership , a very special translation in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word ( co@@ her@@ ed@@ sha ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but maybe with evil back@@ grounds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September in electronic displays in the input field and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in social media .
the mistake was inspired by the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ i , who was also attentive to the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n in Kyoto writes :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the reasonable term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ fecture are ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation . he stated that the error was already mentioned in the text , and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before they were published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that elderly people were off@@ ended by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan , and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but quite cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in the year 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this means that their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents fell in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused accidents caused accidents in the same period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the nam@@ e@@ worthy repor@@ ter brought comments to the light published on the article comments to the light that show what pre@@ judi@@ ces consp@@ ic@@ uous against older drivers : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation has been given the following comments :
- &quot; is that ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) is not the reality ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the translation is not really bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure pit for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for spreading trans@@ lat@@ ors are mani@@ fold .
for example , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transmit it to the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in case of native language . generally , the belief that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the native language - native language .
a French native language , for example , transl@@ ating from English to French , not the French to English .
photo of Flickr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as native language to translate the translations into English . this may be attri@@ but@@ able to translation , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English language skills to learn Japanese .
some companies , which have no foreign employees , leave translations into service internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge becomes the best , translator - no matter how good or bad its language skills are really good .
photo of Flickr user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the ver@@ itable and pet@@ alled sentences are developed by machine translation that this technique can not replace yet long as a human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the r@@ alled re@@ prints , often used T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for st@@ ili@@ st@@ ical reasons - not to be read or understood .

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . but of large companies or from the government to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source of translations into the future .
Venezuela : protest effects and navigation policies on the Internet and TV
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
Friday morning , April 7 , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users that they would not have access to the online station Viv@@ op@@ lay .
other users later wrote that the Internet presence of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are also not accessible .
other online channels also over@@ took recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by opposition groups who oppos@@ e the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and the parliament had transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author in Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is cra@@ cked , and recommended the U@@ r , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are locked again .
this is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been in the coverage of protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission proposed for t@@ elecommunic@@ ations and closure , if they continue to report on the demonstrations by the Commission , as a call to violence . &quot;
I logged in @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national television channels .
amazing that this is still cheaper than two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ e@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
former research institute of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet provider could use DNS . it is a technique that specific domains have to answer a certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ t@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
during V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V @-@ camera @-@ c@@ ann Elvis Flores , who was taken up by the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flores is beaten , while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went back to the show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported to access to multi @-@ media coverage of access to multi media coverage than the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls will become a slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita to her . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a report of spa , conducted by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; flying cows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices , Latin America and re@@ published . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they did not live together with the family who lived there .
just before her study &apos;s degree , she returned to the house once again and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ones who became something has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas is described in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ rides her inferior family or her min@@ aret daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children can never be paid for countless days , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a treaty can &apos;t be taken up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this practice in Paraguay is widely distributed in Paraguay , due to the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for boys and girls .
thereby she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - he collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ger .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one thing , the family , who conclude their daughter in faith , to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can make their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can go to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family that takes care of the girls by itself and just@@ i@@ fies their exploitation by faith , that they would give someone a chance that wouldn &apos;t be an apprentic@@ eship there , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Sac@@ rif@@ ice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never learn about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of heavy blo@@ ws . shortly after that she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of former military personnel Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official assistant .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with just 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira was defeated by a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until it suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they emphas@@ ized that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made a deeply ro@@ oted practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they reported the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest pet@@ itions together and demanded that there will be no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a said .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boy and girls live .
the neigh@@ bors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded an excellent investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case occurs before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n might be pione@@ ering - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go appears .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only explo@@ ited as labour , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k worked , where her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy had to register and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all work and began to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to make money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
they had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn .
they got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
Fri@@ days for example cleans@@ ed the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and the infected floor .
when the school was at an end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they had finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says it never had to star@@ ve , but also not unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the landlord as eating out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminds himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ is@@ ants of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was part of the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a came to face in addition to him and Editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give the reports of the official media over the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not work for intelligent , but did not work with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone to listen while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would see there again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a believed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a that would speak to the indigenous people of Guar@@ ani &apos;s native language . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had the education that they had allowed to lose back , explains it .
her , however , was completely clear that she received for everything she had paid for them with their hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans , of which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , cri@@ ad@@ ita is .
I could not invite anyone home to me . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , where friends arise , I felt very clearly that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can occupy job for cleaning personnel and children in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the As@@ unci@@ on district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
learning to learn .
please call upon you .
starting from Monday when possible .
the display was five &quot; Lik@@ es &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the town Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ eventh girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes little children and is very hand@@ some , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the homeland that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author switched itself once again :
dear friends , I found one found . I look at whether it works with her .
thank you , I write again , if something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ log to report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long yet ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice taken from the early conquest of Paraguay , and the natives of the Spanish conqu@@ erer ) , and the natives of the Spanish conqu@@ erer has had to abol@@ ish that many girls and boys were still un@@ willing to abol@@ ish that many girls and boys become involved in a system of slavery , with whom they become light victims for abuse and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
legisl@@ ative draft Egyptian users social media to register in the government

published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
six@@ ty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians have approved a bill to regul@@ ating regul@@ ates in terms of use and working social networks recently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt on a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law a place would then be set up to use citizens and to use citizens to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in six months of assum@@ ption of the law , user @-@ makers would have to register with their proper names and personal identity numbers to use social networks .
will it be missed to do so , this could bring a penalty up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ves , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is used over the Internet and is used to communicate with others , voice and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is passed through , since the design will not be accepted , as the Egyptian authorities will not be able to impos@@ e the user @-@ makers and users who are not able to register for the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and supporters of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user @-@ makers and user received a username and password &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook has blocked . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known so far that such plans stand .
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , &quot; the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , then it means that they apply a strong surveillance system to apply for citizens who want to request or not . and that means a crazy system to bring about activities of people , and to bring it to a trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be deb@@ ated when the Parliament &apos;s legisl@@ ative elections and the Constitu@@ tional Court should be deb@@ ated before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement has been successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , whose senses is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating sc@@ oring is present on the picture area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says R@@ ao@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ cht@@ y proposed a bill of parliament against Cyber @-@ Crime , which was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who are found guilty to be found guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal protection H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq is to protect the spiritual Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which led through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always have fewer prey .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the feelings of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large rob@@ ber@@ tier is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact is small and goes to zero . when the team makes a recording of a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out of pure joy .
as an educated biolog@@ ist shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which consists of war and conflict .
she has been involved in campaign studies with wild animals and education programmes for Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , documented in the northeast Japan &apos;s daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress which were hit in the last six years , a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an at@@ om accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung is located in S@@ end@@ ai , which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s pre@@ fecture , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ ing events Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to attack , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to van@@ ish whole coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture had a nuclear accident , and alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows how the adv@@ ances were achieved six years later , in order to re@@ build the life of the local area .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ building authority as well as pol@@ l results of the people concerned .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( in the street @-@ party , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima joined the closing light with 70 percent .
even six years after the disaster , one still tries to settle after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by accommodation categories ( in the street , Cau@@ cas@@ su it@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final replacement houses .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers .
almost 40 per cent of the people of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency accommodations in 2011 , whereas I was more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated ones that were hau@@ led after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald , were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction is more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
during almost 100 per cent of the fishing port in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of the fishing port are res@@ umed .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have grown large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 per cent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ground in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the nuclear zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered well , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains un@@ defeated here .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back 90 percent on the same booth as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima can exhibit here only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is native people prepared for the next big earthquake ?
to determine a whole picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacu@@ ated people . she asked them about the state of re@@ building , as well as their feeling of feeling against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o introduced a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation provided that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local resident population , measures took hold in order to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in disast@@ ers prevention was done .
as it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture .
in her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the position of evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima did not only experience the massive earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Pre@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ic accident , which had to take part in Japan .
from 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were transferred outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , there were some more than 23 000 people back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses .
after the stand of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside its native pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated areas , most of the event will fail to get back in the construction work , because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima will compete with massive construction projects . this involves building projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries , which speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the common@@ alities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one more links than it seems at first sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these global connections are important because they expand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , and remember our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we have to look at this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat subjects that they often have less attention than they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which it felt very strongly linked with someone over language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week in the intensive care unit : last Friday he defeated a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a strike against the head . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march towards austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a brain @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors put it on this Saturday and put it in an artificial compass .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread quickly in Brazil within a few days .
on the images there is also the face of police officers , who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until completion of the examination of the procedure was suspended from active service .
the pictures show the police officer , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his punch on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police officer checked by a prot@@ esters and ends on the intensive care unit , would be his face for six months in TV and the whole op@@ pression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ or@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video from Lu@@ iz da Luz , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several San@@ itary shortly after it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the below shown clip one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now have 10,000 Brazi@@ lians ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is located in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for other violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s in memory :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was killed by his father , and here it was a very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked in the intensive care of a police station , after being attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has hit him with a punch .
police over@@ gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s at the last Friday .
polic@@ emen were built at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber boots and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) beg@@ ged the police to aband@@ on violence against prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media reports have sli@@ pped by the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a bro@@ min@@ ated glass windows to illustr@@ ate their title pages .
by contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a loc@@ alized bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken wind@@ shield than the protests of thousands of people who serve in defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognized , if you are stri@@ pped against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also receives an absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of military police are cont@@ ested by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confron@@ tation with police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of the dist@@ ortion of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba included the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the municipality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill , regardless of that there is no significant sugar be@@ ers on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were l@@ ame in the sugar cane factories .
after the rise , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost its facilities until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves ane@@ w .
some changed the work .
others were auto@@ graph@@ ed and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not scre@@ wed up his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , who are back into operation after long in@@ active time , because they were preserved .
that was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene reminds exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad believers are no more news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry disabled ?
the old railway line of the village looked even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically dated , and hardly competitive , they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the mot@@ i@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
however , the sugar cost rose before approximately one decade .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report , &quot; Agricultural Per@@ spectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and agricultural organisation of the United Nations .
if the present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go to history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o on 21 October 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked at the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene is known as a soldier , talking about the closing of the factory , the word which he repe@@ ats most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
to get the place , they formed a full@@ time working group .
before the first school year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially covered by documents which would be removed only regarding parts that would be removed , addressing and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve each withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility and the letters were becoming more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the out@@ set factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the growing sugar cane factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old waiting for the retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved with his will at the stand@@ still of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work .
the best industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important job producers was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , no alternatives were made to work and services that generated plants in the churches where they found themselves were created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the present persons , when he was guaranteed for the areas whose factories were no longer working in operation since five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has only extracted high by Mah@@ len .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the municipality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to swal@@ low them , they also listened to the road to asph@@ alted , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories .
they became spare parts .
without the future eye view , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

youth of the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do with Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of migrant workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , Mobile Ton@@ studios bring directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then with the C@@ ree Hip Hop Group The North@@ Stars together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , confron@@ tation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever occurs in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly inde@@ xed or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First nation uses the motive of a video player to con@@ vey the importance of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the yo@@ ungst@@ ers didn &apos;t always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation can be recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung in C@@ ree .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly by the North@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a result in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k@@ side of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the St@@ anza is available in tran@@ script , also translated into English , translated into German :
sometimes I feel like it would not ever be interested in me
but I try to go on earth my days on earth
that is the day when you will take our cry
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and continue our youth as well .
so you can do it , for what it determin@@ es the creator
in the commentary section , readers and supporters of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also provides a contribution and adds the verse in syl@@ l@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan , one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers exactly what &apos;s exactly on the menu , will be exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the one of the street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Plastic Models of the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of every food that is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers see this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a multitude of these small businesses to produce such plastic dishes , which is documented by the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even re@@ prove them any more . a new trend is transformed today in show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic shells decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge @-@ proof :
here are a few sho@@ cks fridge for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food items will increasingly be more elabor@@ ate .
in this case an imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
this part we made for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple , which holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an asc@@ ending approach into the comic .
some mobile phone support and mobile designer allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , iconic T@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their dou@@ bts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appet@@ izing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition there are travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
other sk@@ inc@@ en@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be viewed under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # G@@ aul .
if you like to know more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is devoted to the service of restaurant industry . such as with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories about the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of fighting drugs . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media over the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the susp@@ ici@@ sts and killed regularly occur only in statistics . however , these reflect at all the extent of the human tragedy that brings the struggle with itself .
the reports about drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ al@@ oa Cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking at the trau@@ ma or to the communities who have learned to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are lag@@ ging behind each body , behind each bone report in hundreds of secret parents , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners who might never heal their wound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico called the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to live with drug traff@@ icking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to live a voice and stories of people telling the struggle between prosecution authorities and maps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime makes us not just fear our lives .
the effects are much profound .
for example , if business include , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ic@@ kers and all commun@@ es have to drive several kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who cho@@ oses secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez who lost their father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have placed ourselves , going to get rid of and after the people we loved to search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13th October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15 , he was supposed to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , which is also with me here .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are the assurance of my father , but she does not pay them out , because the death of dying .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflict , the frag@@ ility and government guidance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
KY@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central mex@@ ico .
their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , it doesn &apos;t matter what form it occurs :
since some years , illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism have been known .
I &apos;ve come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with images that actually can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I &apos;m the only one who was attached or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body once .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider it normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to be nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he &apos;s great . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &apos; hero@@ ic &apos; of off@@ ences if they go through the streets .
for me , it is , as if they have lost ones who have lost someone and those who are afraid , they also have such something .
I see our weakness , when stories to blo@@ ate numbers in a statist@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the human being is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbor@@ ing place are justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devoted &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to agree that they are spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and sil@@ ently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it describes how a family had been ra@@ ped out of their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it describes how the armed crimin@@ als had been destroyed for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also their family apart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think about everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of this never goes , trau@@ ma remains , the fear goes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are away from each other , the better .
she included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , for they don &apos;t know when they kid@@ nap or kill you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether I would like to dissolve my deep @-@ ro@@ oted feelings , but the answer is no , for I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the paper &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crimes ?
how is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous town of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells you that he had to teach himself how to make a egg , potato s@@ own , tort@@ illas warm and &quot; ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years ago when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody husband of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez saw :
Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders based on public security and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors 3@@ 103 k@@ de . this corresponds to average 8.5 Mor@@ a per day .
these are only a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade into the soul of the country .
few stories always live in the face of always new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who we don &apos;t forget .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; project , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in a under@@ stand@@ able way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages where it linked is left , include pictures on which violence is represented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to withdraw a rum@@ or or fal@@ si@@ fication a f@@ ake .
but how is the years after being di@@ pped ? content in social media , no matter whether or true , tend to stand further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
since its first release , it was used to be mis@@ leading , trage@@ dies to images that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false text &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false text &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices , or First Dra@@ ft News - deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage regarding events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it th@@ rows questions about our desire for pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank car crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after civil war Africa &apos;s second largest country has been negle@@ cted and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous far@@ es full of stro@@ kes , who were difficult to drive .
the applic@@ ant fell victim to the victims .
the administration officials describe a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinem@@ as in the vicinity , which was full of people who descri@@ p@@ tive the soccer world championship .
houses burned and bon@@ ded cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the procedure make the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of bon@@ ded body , which are str@@ ing@@ ed on the ground while persons are looking at .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years , the same photo was scre@@ ened several times on social media , blogs , and other platforms , but not due to the related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the dra@@ ined towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically from at@@ ro@@ cities where they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count Lei@@ chen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were crum@@ bled , shot or burned .
only from satellite images could be depicted above .
the cause for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army @-@ based in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to win ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo again showed up as proof for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one of the number of patches ; Africa check has been issued orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image has been shown as a cover to massage analyses .
one step further adds personal comments such as this example , the picture from the DR Congo , with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge joined the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who could escape are pun@@ ches , ra@@ pe and some dead , some caused by burning .
while others reported from violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s found the following descriptions to summar@@ ize these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which claimed in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an Being said , mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to view this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , AF@@ P as their source , had also written Th@@ an Being this statement , but did not have the image from the DR Congo in connection .
the global range of false data
traces of this false coupling ranges back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere around the world .
using a &quot; converted picture search , &quot; you can see how far information can be exceeded .
an converted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures from the DR Congo ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the resulting image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h private pages , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have been forwarded to false reports , others tried to ex@@ lar@@ v@@ ae the fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have bor@@ dered the examples of mis@@ use and linked to the respective countries , based on which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the reach clear@@ er than by the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the listed countries listed in some cases ( which were also associated with each other ) , multiple samples can be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
examples of false cop@@ es of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries refer to pages or servers , and are still available on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ tering .

as a memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( inclu@@ sions ) that go through this post . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence about the silence of Christians through Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images will be used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers cannot give any longer faith to these images .
with social media , there are few people who are un@@ intended to have the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ars this m@@ oods of the mis@@ - and false information that real at@@ ro@@ cities are un@@ true and fl@@ ushes it from what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the re@@ tention of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even required by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern is to feel violent more readers and viewers des@@ pic@@ able and emp@@ athy the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as violent media seem to help others to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
Techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; in which a picture suggests a bit suggests , which actually can be derived from the context or completely un@@ disp@@ ense .
however , every examination should be false conc@@ essions , however , should also consider how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. in@@ ex@@ changeable ) tries to offer voice enth@@ r@@ ities from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these unnecessary words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others , which are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ ret@@ esa ) .
but all are stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly persistent every attempt to an easy translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole time .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog , for example words , you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ Ã¼@@ h to your parents in recognition of how to stri@@ ve for you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The comfort or sl@@ oth you feel after being heated in cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
they di@@ stra@@ ins other cultures , un@@ veil other things , and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site , and show more of these &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; editors of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload your favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently looking for the worst flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , usually at the end of May , rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya into 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
following a statement by the disaster in Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missed because of the floods and mud .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought about 304 safe stay varieties .
the rainf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water distances in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygienic conditions of the population const@@ itute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lan@@ kan &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ ber@@ crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da in G@@ alle also floo@@ ded the water pump of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue transactions and another five are made for transport of emergency deliveries to the inhabitants closed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also explained to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Desk@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about high water situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams are required for their operations please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry foods and foods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app to provide the cat@@ astroph@@ ic center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high water aid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key to call it users to pick up a vehicle for pickup of assistance and donations . they became re@@ directed to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ische Red Cross . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as well , they led an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat reactions to result by floods and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully explo@@ ited , make people in need of security and contribute to help .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereas the population of Sri Lan@@ kan is now the long way to recover norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
using .@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour , and love friend .
I trusted her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we will call for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ ep@@ tions we add rights to trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from a American flag , others tend to oppos@@ e Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looked at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not I am Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already led this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years - the Sah@@ ar , who they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has built up in their performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they need to susp@@ end me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify themselves to be a Muslim , on different kind . but somehow we are put all in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective performance that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , has mus@@ cled .
to be mis@@ used
I do not stand alone .
that &apos;s even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what paintings come to you in the sense if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ xer Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an , and Prophet Muhammad , were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea , religion has been deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another one is in the reduced images of Muslims , Western books have been colon@@ ized for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman who should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid broke the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images also rise further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood they continue to store them .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how to domin@@ ate the powerful , incorrect nar@@ rative our news@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rative is a reality that led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the USA did not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are w@@ alled to bear their head@@ scarf in public buildings and comp@@ elled to cover their entire body to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same medal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this powerful Nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women , which lead movements to change .
it looks that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who were brought to slave vessels .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has seized on our collective imagination , that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children are becoming an@@ tim@@ ental attacks and ch@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell you , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion people belong
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rative , which help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to have failed to capture the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and here we have failed to spend seven million Muslims living in the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my native parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother made her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ sts from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan had re@@ thinking the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were sore sore Muslims and Americans .
but am I now an unt@@ amed Muslim and American ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t say no pork , I tell you - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of respect from Pep@@ pa W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am j@@ ok@@ ing , we do not carry all hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make an effort to tackle widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ op@@ ar@@ isation machine with money , think tanks and experts for Fal@@ se information , which is already a faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or of which Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell you , there is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in more than just a stranger , who ri@@ eves the head@@ scarf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in his ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so wide , so versatile and complex that it can possibly be able to fit in a drawer .

I want to explain it .
I was born as the Muslim but a Muslim was born in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a temporary mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious lives , they act on the following terms : believe , behavior and belonging .
my muscular faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbor , will see my rock in the surf that I could see Muslims when they could look through the 15 @-@ metre concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the al@@ ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I saw them in my arms , and their Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an and be called Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim states are always part of my shadow .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the picture of you that I will see my eyes . Nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger ; and an Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with an one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can be virtually co@@ stly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslim has meant to be the prayers , which they had said to me , if I have a bad day .
Muslim has to be like she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a people that has been founded by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has founded a company with the name Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has it a deep meaning to call my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;

belonging to it means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my desire is weeping .
meanwhile , while he writes books about modern Islam and over the independence K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept for his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close into his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palest@@ in@@ ians , whose families were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists , who have been torn down by the Muslim world as at stake .
Muslim to be meant to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have destroyed all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was rejected by a Muslim country before a century ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that at the same time , the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir of British Empire , was referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it means that four years ago , the most powerful military of the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , to pursue mass destruction weapons , which did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to know an American Muslim , the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that if a tragedy carries the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is more reported than a history with a white assass@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was proclaimed by a liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .

an American woman , a P@@ asch@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inher@@ ent inter@@ se@@ quest@@ ality of our more impressive ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother , to worry about my child , and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this branch structural simil@@ arity .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia consists of the Muslim regist@@ rations , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it exists in consistent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immig@@ ration officials who took up a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders against people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ fly list , &quot; which records Arab@@ s and Muslims into the visor .
it is the wars which we carry and the bombs we cast down to Muslim countries .
because of the stories we can tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed a scientific image and asked them to assess groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that We Need To Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to treat the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back for decades , the roots of our fears and the f@@ law@@ ed and dangerous objects that we store in our news magazines .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which attempts to capture our many different ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ lies Muslim authors , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned with this difficult global time of time in which we are .
and that moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now lead the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims for &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by making the &quot; other &quot; created .
a few years ago it had not yet been given them ; now they have master@@ ed large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and history , which I was not aware of being my daughter , as it is now my daughter , but today I have made me to an un@@ fortun@@ ate Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
things I have left here like a baking @-@ cro@@ c lane in my speech .

these are no terms , with which we usually throw in our schools for us or we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why did I tell that at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has been shown to us how wars are being guided to us and to be enth@@ r@@ alled by the work of the &quot; other &quot; in public perception , four decades ago even scientists of Stan@@ ford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions concerning the role of its , deliber@@ ately and un@@ aware the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it did not have a new future , as he bom@@ bed us a new future , while he bom@@ bed us a new future , while he bom@@ bed us a new future , while he had already bom@@ bed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man bom@@ bed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for patri@@ arch@@ art wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ elling , by Flickr user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an option , here and now in spite of a language barrier to anyone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ removable blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in O@@ ak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not given to the native children .
for the makers of this project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we do the cities which have not forgotten the diversity , in which inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to be eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening is often associated to understand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purposes these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel , to link . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers make their story first in their own language and translate , or explain it in English .
even if participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their surrender and their representation is that the list@@ eners in@@ sist@@ ed on it .
they call laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional history dating from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou cons@@ ulates also the opportunity to explain the history of customs of nar@@ rative .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the H@@ oses and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after he explains the meaning of his foot , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it that you don &apos;t understand ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares his language with a wide count@@ ess : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organiz@@ ers hope to expand this . everyone who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS .
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ proof of state school
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took part on a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and bourgeois organizations involved in a mass demonstration ; the Mar@@ sch started at the Pu@@ ertor@@ ies Capitol , the capital building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ chman Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da , &quot; ( ci@@ ary for the neur@@ on of the debts ) and the Lo@@ com@@ en@@ ical Assembly of Puerto Ric@@ os .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ate of the restructuring of the debt also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto R@@ ican calls for the politicians , banks and government agencies who are responsible for their corruption to take responsibility for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial review and a line committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding to the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ ican refused to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the National Alliance of the USA - suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a government @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation , with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law of government responsibility , as an alternative to the exist@@ ent state vision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a vast restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actions imposed on the outside will be driven without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizen who will be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration was called &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth . &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he did for an open network .
during this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , dedicated to the event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ ner ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective after@@ research ) .
the book published in the last year was released and licensed here , contains a number of par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book wants to discuss how movements can be set up for free knowledge and what is the true cost , with which it is connected .
activists , artist , designer , researchers , researchers , researchers , researchers , researchers and writers , have been working on site to watch over the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create something different from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , imprisoned and celebrated Internet volunteers since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted on the Ad@@ ra prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and want to know him back in its normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
for what do we have chosen ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown place .
his wife , writer and lawyer , N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel had taken the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was cont@@ acted on 12 November 2015 by people who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad administration , and they informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his dwelling place and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in expanding the Internet and to know how to open the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently survived the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes were more looking than the work that he started to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras in 2005 .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the crossing of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural models with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel didn &apos;t even know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put all this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike in the digital Archae@@ ology and Conservation has created a period of time , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not yet shut up this project .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my overall life to dream of freedom and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med , when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in jail .
I have learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught others to use them how they use computers , at least theoretical , without that they actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a trial log that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in jail .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together a year along with the book .
they s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English .

since the protests of the protests , Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads has disappeared for more than 65@@ ,000 people according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or executed by the regime led by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .

Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption , the director strongly condemn his sentence back to previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption discovered by a government member , after half his sentence of his sentence , returned to the corruption in which the corruption was committed .
Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants ( around 800 000 Euro ) and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called his return to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General in the Republic of the Republic , there would be no obst@@ acle reason for Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old post as the company was no disciplinary procedure after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to re@@ mark the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we have to know is that the company should have in@@ tox@@ icated by the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company remained silent , however , and does not include appropriate legal steps for the application of respective functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and consider the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resist@@ ible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had dinner .
he could keep spe@@ ech@@ es and motiv@@ ating spe@@ ech@@ es , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but because he is in@@ competent , he has approved to re@@ integrate into the company , which he helped to harm damage .
so it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
refu@@ te !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science , says the director of no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza rewarded by the state , because he bel@@ lied to him , I cannot believe someone in such a way that has already ins@@ ulted the state so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza lack the mor@@ als to come back and serve the state , * he had already been serving a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it is only served by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as handles it for an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible source of money , and the state itself is we@@ ari@@ ed , and was finally condemned to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers it to remember the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a thief belongs to the prison :
Die@@ be belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el , not only to be remembered as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , single @-@ cut and - even as a sharp , proph@@ etic editor .
one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions , when he was energetic , that &quot; An ambitious person is capable of all his amb@@ itions , his own personal interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man does not change my experience that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not change his amb@@ itions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also le@@ aning :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or spo@@ age .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network recorded their posters from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
even though it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to reject people from the native origin or in general as ad@@ jective . &quot;
Facebook is cen@@ sored by the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese Scrip@@ tures ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of H@@ ass@@ in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the ascent of radical nation@@ alistic movements gave the word an extremely effective con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word which mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a h@@ ass@@ speak against Muslims who represent a minority of population in Myanmar .
but in the efforts to fight H@@ ass@@ in Myanmar in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sensu@@ al content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with rac@@ ism in connection , but the word of itself does not call herself h@@ ass@@ le .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they discussed the use of the word or doubt , in purpose of his usage , have been cen@@ sored .
in addition there are several bur@@ mes@@ ial words with fundamental mean@@ ings which have the same letter sequence such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letter as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ elling ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( veil ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ thing A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends has been deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends for a spiritual way whether they could w@@ ush as he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain , giving himself a word of word .
the proposition ku la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ER is the opinion that they decrease to radi@@ ally radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic can be analy@@ tic before it dis@@ semin@@ ate all the post@@ age that susp@@ ect rac@@ ism to sus@@ pic@@ ion .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word .
the Autom@@ ati@@ c@@ ism will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking the right words .
for example , Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age @-@ age ) .
the good thing is that these tri@@ ck@@ igen nation@@ alists who are spreading the hate , get a pretty good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all the hate language , the efficiency of this strategy may not be long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the c@@ ens@@ orship of keywords are often a cat and mouse game , where users can simply start to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to clear his post@@ s when he wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ on@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to share post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook Community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has not correspon@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative inten@@ tions or simply try to show their opinions against the H@@ ass@@ speak radi@@ k@@ aler nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate language :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author distributed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are badly damaged in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the initiative of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community for advice :
Facebook likes a well @-@ looking int@@ ent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
such words to zen@@ ge will only bring more hat@@ red inside the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moreover , it seems as if they have started this without any local context or technical support , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found that they made mistakes , they did not temp@@ t the fal@@ si@@ fied Post@@ s .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that make them a big turnover , that would be great .
fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has made good care for users among the users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are doing fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their post@@ ings are taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post@@ s , which contained no H@@ ass@@ aria , but still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch As@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry and watch a Indian film .
only to try whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

next post : if you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;

in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious foundations , social networks have used to expand their votes and their influence , has increased .
among other things , H@@ ass@@ le is to heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his saying that critic@@ ises the wu@@ ther@@ ing h@@ ass@@ le on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but instead of defin@@ ing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end of the children &apos;s before
a wedding ring in the sand .

the nur@@ ser@@ y before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago to be illegal .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided to offer a law that is to offer this practice , so that the advis@@ able age is at 18 .
before this change of marriage took some members , and Muslim religious communities , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj told , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not inter@@ fere in the state , since that , age is not the maturity . &quot;
this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has been a contrac@@ ting partner of UN &apos;s legal prevention , the min@@ ors as well as to any people under the age of 18 . &quot;
the UN &apos;s statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago is 2.8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 the official statistics of the country confirmed that by 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that ende@@ av@@ ours to abol@@ ish laws on the children &apos;s before , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hindu leaders , for example , had no concern about telling the critics of the children &apos;s before they should be condemned to take care of their own matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition cared for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point in doubt , whether the opposition would agree with the bill of law .
but in early 2017 , the bill of law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that contained himself contained in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where already a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update to Facebook , the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle at Inst@@ agram .
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill against the child &apos;s before was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one voted against it .
after he had decided before the Senate , the draft will now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws on the child &apos;s before were finally changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a Minister of Minist@@ ers in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has veil@@ ed the core of it , but do you know what ? the child &apos;s before is illegal and Tobago is almost worth every price .
while Abel &apos;s opinion was , it was definitely long enough to create the practice was L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas convinced that the day was finally come :
public Status Update to Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot; Excellent news !
the marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 on it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belong to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law be noted :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious cerem@@ onies 18 years .
the design to change the marriage was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 MPs in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were against were voted for the law .
the Children &apos;s Day is in Trinidad and Tobago not permitted by law anymore .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ age@@ way abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who have fo@@ rested him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook is in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judi@@ cial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to have his promise to be redeemed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law , it would be quite right if Mahar@@ aj wish to proceed against the law , the most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if , instead of keeping the discussion so generally , in a way that we would like to talk about the state in our bedroom , that they may cause them from big , hard @-@ mentioned men who are opposed to them , would you be willing to carry on the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judi@@ cial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s before in different ab@@ outs remain legal or even the norm , although there is laws that they may sign .

although Turkey has been deported from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , you will find regular block@@ ings of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most well @-@ known country in the world when it comes to a massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia are also oft@@ enly updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform leaves all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is also call@@ able despite legal ban .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS tells about his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . this is the possibility to read the content of dec@@ entr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help the users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org itself .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was conducted independently by the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pe@@ .org , an open source project that everyone can use to host a similar Mir@@ ror@@ sides , if imprisoned in the respective country Wikipedia .
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one is access@@ ing another URL , which is not the original one . that &apos;s what you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server guides the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself when this is locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to alert the need for nature protection
a succes@@ ful r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ly positioned mot@@ i@@ fs and washed colours .
the motivated him to wear a camera with him and trying to gra@@ ze the situation .
then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is trying to make Nept@@ ar , Nept@@ une wildlife on the international stage .
and his home office right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that goes attention to Nept@@ une wildlife .
he described on Facebook , as it helps him this first class situation at his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Parks , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wild photographer ! !
I just rested at home , when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) cried . he had received a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to gain a cooperation with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal and wants to understand that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious , as they look like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he should know it , because he had already been tig@@ ers from face to face toward : &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tiger cannot inter@@ fere with the opinion of sheep anymore ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he is immediately going to see us and he star@@ es me through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly stayed in a tent while in the Bar@@ dia National Park recording of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it lasted until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist resorts .
see some of these photos below .

years after the marriage took Indian women for the first time to speak the name of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village of Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a p@@ onom@@ ic or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women that they should respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should be aware of the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ da@@ a by a head@@ court and disper@@ sed by her family and the village community after they had a married relatives with name .
the tradition also not call their wives by name is also widespread among men . however , they have far less assign@@ ments to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , and house@@ wives , a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the enemy &apos;s enemy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as one of 56 clubs that is in 13 Indian countries , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er and set aside for the removal of the Patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages those clubs .
it reports about how these clubs created a safe place for those women and they made it at the same time at the bottom of the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round , did not know women who did not call their hus@@ bands .
she has decided on this subject because they wanted to open the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women could identify easily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the names of their hus@@ bands will not speak lou@@ dly , so that they have not guilty on all paid and never question@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini comments :
this tradition confirms that a woman wishes her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not agree , is considered a dar@@ ker , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband , had never been called by name , how it is going on .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother in law and my husband were silent after the video was finished .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name .
Roh@@ ini started its first discussion with this confidence in their luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never heard before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to put the discussion with a practice in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want us to respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the por@@ ridge of a centuries old tradition who married women the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she stopped during the whole exercise , and another decided to let him out all the united Fru@@ str@@ ation against him and his family , by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in addition , ad@@ renal@@ ine was still strug@@ gling with an ancient rock , the women decided that they would actually try home to call their hus@@ bands at home .
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in his head , his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed , she was afraid , saying that it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports like women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , showing the sp@@ icious status :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would bear the chin @-@ red point if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard that to carry him .
the other women have not completely stopped , but they think they are now in a better position , even to choose him not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at any discussion .
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want women to worry who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
during the last few months she celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have done about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are made to our hus@@ bands , never said to be honest .
it feels great to tell certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have only bore Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is this okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , wear it not dar@@ ed .
after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own coat @-@ selection , mor@@ ality is connected with the Sar@@ is and more , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled Roh@@ ini her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that women could wear it .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they can do it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion group , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles :
so far , we only made small steps .
some women have tried it a few times , but then we listened to her husband &apos;s name .
some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now contribute to each time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in the discussion group know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the cla@@ iming for more freedom of movement or their own coat @-@ selection - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
every one of us is a sacrifice of Patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club each of us gives confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman enters the club home and tell other people what we talk about what we are talking about .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beatles is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beatles in her landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on June 29 this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; held in the community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Beatles @-@ commem@@ oration ) in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans were inter@@ changeable and their appreciation for the Beatles shared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visit of the Beatles in 1966 was considered to be the revers@@ al in Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed by the Beatles 1964 in London , noted on the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for just under five days , the Beatles were in the country , but this was enough to turn the Japanese . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people here soon became clear that they had no other choice when the Beatles receive an open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith , when the Beatles came to Japan in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retailers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! ! today the Beatles @-@ commem@@ oration of Japan . in the case 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo .
even today , songs from the Beatles sang in Japanese Karaoke bars and in English teaching at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beatles survived everything .
today it is the Beatles Mem@@ orials .
we all love in our house the Beatles .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John Lenn@@ on should display or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese is of course making pilgrimage to the well known places that are related to the band .
in the street If you love the Beatles , you are your 5 places you need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( New York memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages may sometimes not be quir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today it is the Beatles Mem@@ orials .
exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came the first time to Japan .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies offer the fan base also market@@ able , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! the Beatles is The Beatles Mem@@ orials .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I will eat R@@ amen the no@@ od@@ les with Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the day is going to walk today .

a new system of kidn@@ apped people for organic trading , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , presumably the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government called now a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed , and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and resulted in the consequence that the organs of sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
it will give the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a female man &apos;s husband can bring gold old or riches , explained the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks were registered on a crew of six men in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , people with al@@ bin@@ ism are .
this led to the UN 2016 mission led a mission to investig@@ ate this practice in the South African country .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government campaigns developed to fight these super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have prepared to travel in the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le males , who travel to Mozambique are destination of young men in Mozambique are target of rit@@ u@@ eller attacks , war@@ med the Muslim police after the latest murder of three young men on their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations took place .
Hus@@ ated alg@@ y Ad@@ amo , student , and residents of the city of In@@ h@@ amb@@ ane in the south of Mozambique , said that local police announced the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of the number of men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution and assass@@ ination of the crew in the district of Mor@@ on@@ bal@@ a , Province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably super@@ st@@ itious rit@@ u@@ als , has been promoted by the traditional Sh@@ am@@ ans , but also indicates that a belie@@ ving would have existed , according to whom the victims had power in the head of power that gener@@ alize the wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last days , three men with hair@@ s problems were murdered in this part of the country .
in Facebook , Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha divided the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ g@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , which indicates that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty in which Mozambique is facing :
I would like to ask R@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , a country where people would like to take care of good marks , and other achievements , a nation where people wouldn &apos;t hurt or even their lives to get a country in which the al@@ bin@@ os can still be ch@@ ased or &quot; black magic &quot; that aim to get to slow wealth .
despite the appoint@@ ness of the phenomena , some have the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter advis@@ er , twe@@ e@@ ete , that both the chief of the Mor@@ on@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as also the police officer Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both gl@@ az@@ kÃ¶@@ ping are :

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which probably did not happen recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has moved in international community attention when his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after having committed himself to the draft of the Charta , a manifest@@ o that calls the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Li@@ us Case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker tells me to discuss this thing with some other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , to allow him to permit a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely out of the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ med up some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ eid R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
however , a speaker refused to comment if the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to facilitate Liu abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Minister of Minist@@ ers in Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian Government finally did nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations only continued until December last year . Norway signed an agreement in June to record the salmon , since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel committee brought his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Ms. Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to gain his price .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was promp@@ ted to free Liu and his wife without delay and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called for the release of China on the release of Li@@ us , as in a statement on June 30 :
we expect to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
you should meet and receive all visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that Americans asked him that he has the opportunity to treat the treatment abroad , if it be careful with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27 , announced that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities decided not to release Liu X@@ ia as well as his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the withdrawal of the US embassy moved out a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country had the right to re@@ locate himself and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following following :
protection and freedom such as travel for@@ ti@@ bility and access to the health care of his choice , which they have claims according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife un@@ conditi@@ on@@ ally release .
I am demanding China to un@@ conditi@@ on@@ ally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o to provide proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Liu was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all medical support , which he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8 .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could over@@ shadow Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada , Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China requested to provide appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to aband@@ on himself from his family .
Li@@ us Adv@@ oc@@ ate told AF@@ P before that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to contact someone outside , including its lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you :
Canada requires China to preserve its international human rights , including freedom of expression , to preserve and to release them for exercising this rights .
France
France &apos;s external ministry urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons on 29 June .
all necessary measures have to be taken in order to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments , which he , regardless where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family can contact him .
although the news of France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was announced that there will be no other information that France would ultimately receive him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Festivals in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release Liu and demand a greater tolerance towards those who want peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Taiwan , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu also urged China to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to treat yourself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a declaration on June 28 at Liu very worried and asked that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well@@ being .
he told Liu :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my faith , that he had taken , and for whom he had been pun@@ ish@@ able , led to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and weal@@ thy China , which would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt very moving and encour@@ aging me when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore was considered a town .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting in the meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people were critic@@ ised by the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be considered a town .
... nobody question@@ ed whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , where most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the judi@@ cial minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacri@@ fic@@ tions to create this precious country , we hear that we are not a country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a escape before the responsibilities , a bre@@ ach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons made by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of its , he appeared irre@@ voc@@ ally un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities that are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the core point of the subject , the good old bodies of the author@@ itarian fe@@ eders appears to be the prec@@ urs@@ ed demo@@ c@@ rats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power .
at the end of the last week Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am given answers to his American guests regarding our press , Judi@@ ci@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answer .
appropriate questions tar@@ red with non @-@ Ans@@ ational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clari@@ fy his opinion , as it did not understand this conclusion .
personally I think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point where he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by announ@@ cing on the blog his comment , he wrote about the critics that you should begin to read the entire co@@ dex of the conference , so that in the context of the testim@@ onies of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am could be better , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore was so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy ourselves free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities had a party to win a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore was no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously spoke it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , which makes a leading of a growing generation , such a pol@@ emic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much ...
at least I didn &apos;t know about Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de what I expected - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have dou@@ bts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK review explo@@ res the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ter spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is not a country , we are considered as an independent and so@@ vereign State ?
if not , what land is the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the Singap@@ ure do their military service , but defend her city just not their land ?
who must pay off our Prime Minister &apos;s bills ?
what is the value of our pink personal identity ?
are we the citizens of a country , or the inhabitants of a city ?
, ten@@ ds the Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the affir@@ mation of Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have many Singap@@ our@@ ers to be angry ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most ab@@ used aspect of your homeland or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is asked for me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polit@@ ely to show interest in his dialogue partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my mind follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans are cooking perhaps inside of anger , but if they are held for Americans , but doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for anyone who doesn &apos;t know , there &apos;s little to be different from Americans by Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on her ruck@@ sack when travelling .
they all love Canadian .
Americans , however , ... .
so it was , when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th of September .
Canadian have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to be distinguished by their American neighbours .
we have a free Healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
gender equality has been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is supposed to be considered as the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we are Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends , which I admire very much .
I would do nothing if you would like to conf@@ use me to Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nett . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fir@@ stly , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means , is basically to be idle - as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically significant figure N@@ ed Flanders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada would really have a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would actually be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kind &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no corners and edges , nothing that can be driven by .
harmless , means to be un@@ remarkable and un@@ interesting and don &apos;t earn attention .
that may be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major branch of the Canadian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own business .
what out@@ sider is called &quot; nice , &quot; maybe just bold courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we &apos;re missing the warm heart@@ y , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ert in Thail@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one of the famous pop @-@ band played in Thailand , which the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ das , who took power in 2014 , and despite their promises to restore the civil government in 2014 .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what regulations makes his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video is in@@ directly based on the persist@@ ing military dom@@ ination of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the song to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , this was divided on Facebook highly charged video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 lique@@ urs .
last month , Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists stri@@ pped to watch the public .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to Thai politics , in particular with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has passed in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ stic Constitution of 44 of the provisional Constitution , resulting in the Commander of the He@@ ader absolute decision @-@ making of important national topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11 . rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image above reflects the implementation of the law on computer criminal , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often explo@@ ited by the authorities for activ@@ ist activists and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a new unity in the army has been set up , the online content is monitored and persons that were accused of which monarchy promised to have bol@@ dly persec@@ uted .
Thailand gains a strict hy@@ dr@@ ation against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed well in Thailand .
two days later there came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts predi@@ ct that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax funds .
in the video it is even shown how people will be thrown into a black delivery van before replacing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are sitting in the prison , because they allegedly committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and the use of the Internet should end@@ ure the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band members of the band called the Sal@@ ut &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the viol@@ ins in the Eastern Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war company re@@ covers only slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies , especially in the district of T@@ sar@@ arch@@ al .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ sar@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon mon@@ ks of Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called by viol@@ as in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war era there were more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in this v@@ aul@@ ted city .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ sar@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people had barely increased over a decade .
about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district in 1989 .

&quot; all is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey residence of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ ka &apos; , symbo@@ lic@@ ally stand for the decline and destruction of the region .
the buildings are fallen and quite rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult to finish this .
&quot; this is all a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why speak ?
it is nevertheless unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ ici@@ est spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district .
there are about fifty inhabitants in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , who still can host one or two families , are recogni@@ zes at the balconies , where it is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the windows of a destroyed house .
when she dis@@ covering me with the camera in his hand , they immediately go back .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ sar@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subsi@@ dy industry ( cultivation of scenic products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetables .
it is difficult over the rounds to come .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
about ten years ago a older woman moved to Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to assume no financial support from her daughter and supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells her that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate their holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holiday are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this continuously , each with its own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour will appear on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya to her . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cchini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ation@@ in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a few time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself to the village of the village .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ set@@ ia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia broke out ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative hall in Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will last something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is receiving approximately $ 9 children every child .
her husband works in the cab@@ bage .
the young family has their own farm .
in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , rab@@ bits and chick@@ ens .
she tells that it was a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in time , they lost their fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not fear the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any job and all lived like it was right .
I recall it every day , as the city and war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy goes past us .
it runs through the windows of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies from the window and another boy ch@@ ases him .
he plays with the ball , which then fold the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
while they walk , some of them throw stones into the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for im@@ purity in their lives .
you don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a kor@@ allen @-@ pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ frame and gold colored rings in t@@ eddy bear form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the pre@@ mise there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an immigrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us people get in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they call to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
currently it is still quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already been sleeping on the boxes outside .
she wants to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medicines that they can &apos;t pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sts them away from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jog@@ ging be@@ ard ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came to Brazil from Angola and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao is travelling with his sister , hoping to come to Boston to return to her husband and the three children .
they have been living in Brazil for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States , to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other itiner@@ aries of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a famous name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel the way and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of his pione@@ ers , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy has been weaker , he began his journey into the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has been a guest in Mama Africa for months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bust@@ ick@@ et after Ti@@ juana &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reply he smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests to send their often text messages when they are going to gr@@ ind them or to report her about the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ ks hope for migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken refuge in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that Bust@@ ick@@ ets are sold too expensive for numerous African migrants .
he began to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests make .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they &apos;re experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;

back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , travelers keep quiet their phones .
a small bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , much of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of them that went away .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communications equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users to the community .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi was given a mobile notification in which she points to the district government , a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , the app is said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app before they were exchanged with a private We@@ Chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app would establish the sources and the distribution of terror@@ ists , together with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online sc@@ am , Troj@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to help users to keep it online , and remote control your own home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; might be able to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person or steal it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the East and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , dist@@ ressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme pro@@ positions and surveillance measures as well as the rout@@ in@@ cess@@ ary internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from the China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the cen@@ sored news in China published , showed photos from a Check@@ point where the c@@ ops were un@@ checked , whether they have installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered using a check@@ point using a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a blow for technological development .
they forced people to use devices that are intended for older people , to use .
this is a form of captivity through the growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from the China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in the street ) , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system to get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are used to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government branches , authorities and with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uni@@ fying and destroy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other potential fare , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or Death , Part 1 : all scre@@ ams to death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is sign@@ posted his experience in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and you firmly believe that you are all alone on a place where everything is important .
everything has dissolved after and after dissolved and a truth revealed , which is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one who makes all glory to her name .
one who had to settle down into a list of feelings and expres@@ sions , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you recover reality and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the nice scenes and the performer - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and all cri@@ es after death .
all doubt solve them in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is going on to the axis of the unknown . dir is clear that you have put down your parents here between the walls , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and arrested my father three times , but this was not enough for me to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the leader of the security services it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he presented his power over us proof that he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five teen@@ agers have been torn apart during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city broke out the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the districts have cov@@ eted to , just my own .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ eless , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city , which is up@@ lifting up to the arter@@ ies with state safety and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night things had something cal@@ ming , after the power supply in the district ceased to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke out the silence by crying out several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice by the silence resist@@ ed .
a few minutes later , some of my friends feel brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends had joined me . we joined in a splendid picture which filled my expectations full and fulfilled .
in such a moment , you are aware that you are liberated the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care for you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return to your voice , after you have lost all the way to the office of Security Service from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ assan was there with several of his men : my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ assan explains to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear , as you are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his spectac@@ le filled eyes on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look at what to look in my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps to the revolution .
I was so sure of my case as I said , &quot; I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped to look in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret no word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father right with this . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this pro@@ flu@@ ent sentence lies until today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ ams the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again , through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a course to the sol@@ itary cells .
I think all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise they have shared a larger cell in this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and may immediately sit down , without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I grab@@ bed a well @-@ tried communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell phone was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sth@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time , he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells , there was a respected man of middle ages that looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no markings can be recognised by me , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are linked to its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the major cells .
perhaps he will list@@ ens immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would fre@@ eing him when I stay .
liar .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row , to drive all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ ours fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
from the distance I still hear it &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be at least 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the cry , every day .
the door opens up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that Black saw the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the hor@@ ror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; playing on the 13th of the Kor@@ an ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
this was the secret to protect the state security before us and prevent the betra@@ ying and terror@@ ists in us , they say in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ch dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ ession@@ istic experience and ri@@ ver@@ ted the narrow perspective of her world view .
this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform the c@@ lans in a hero .
I cared for the hearing and meet Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin with your life as you &apos;re doing so much more important to protest you this day and to protest r@@ allies , which soon will find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer , not to reply .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication .
when and how did that happen , it was essential .
any voice in me told me that I had to get used to get punished , even though I did nothing to earn these punishment .
at penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to rip me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your h@@ unter talks to your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot hold your cry .
my terror was not enough yet enough , so they inter@@ change the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ators had been working as a garbage dump or was it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cables to inter@@ fere with each other , in order to present great invention of a huge cab@@ le@@ es .
within one hour three of them changed while I was still in the row .
I had lost any sense in my body - and even my voice , which is why I heard to cry .
the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t know any thing about it , which is why he became next to an electri@@ cally loaded staff .
power flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to store all my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body that was stretched out on the ground was the perfect starter .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep back again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed by me as minutes .
then call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhau@@ sting youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to be fear@@ ful to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and walk away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always free .
where do they get me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text , recorded .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends the bulk of his time inside ; let him ride at his canvas , even to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his in@@ car@@ ot@@ enes covered with nic@@ otine .
he lives in the top of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where it had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activity which is transferred to the conservative majority and asks its old proven opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which deals with topics like Oriental , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian ge@@ aring up , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only valid in his hometown Amman Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that will take place from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders , and he can suffer according to their own statement by people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t open it openly , he stim@@ ulate a special inc@@ lin@@ ation against the US @-@ American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Amman .
taken by the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who have to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Palestinian ge@@ aring of the second generation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - so he himself was born even if he was born in Jordan , never before Palestine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living conditions , &quot; st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sh@@ ook the nest in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is provided for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an illegal .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the s@@ laugh@@ tering lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ ist of the Kent @-@ cigarette in the nose into the first place of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when looking at a glance into the neighbor@@ ing countries .
from hence , it is easy to do basic things - as to the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Interior Jord@@ anian has said a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
a number of par@@ liament@@ arians supporting the Islamic State Court - argu@@ ed that sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood , Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dic@@ ts cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert tab@@ s be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MPs and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN says that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m which puts the old legitim@@ acy author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the whole region in@@ quire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a rated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which continues to use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to slow down rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually an increasingly challenging reality in Jordan reflects the appearance in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b declined traditional gender nor@@ ms by bur@@ sting his vision of the fate of Arabic women , having called vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a manifest unknown woman whose arms and legs extends up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should actually trust .
over the past few years in Jordan the number of &quot; hon@@ our@@ moral &apos; has increased - the un@@ official out@@ ward left .
human Rights Watch according to their climax ; however , the number of hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als in 2016 reached its peak . however , Jordan continues to develop its institu@@ tional infrastructure to support the women who ass@@ ented the victims of murder , or domestic violence .
according to a law concerning the breaking news from the year 1954 , women who are subjected to danger of domestic violence , &quot; and for her release is often a year@@ long bureau@@ cratic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for it , also not to dec@@ eive topics in his country as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b denied that his work is political , however , dre@@ amt that he is his music , which is full of explic@@ it announ@@ cements on sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion , is not able to separate politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
for me , Politics was unanim@@ ous , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are in the core of politics can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which you can get in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that which one wants to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan spoke about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T + individuals still were strongly cen@@ sored by 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ age Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn out of the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored by his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but was only re@@ worked version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T + community and represents the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance on homosexu@@ als did not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory with his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ What , who later should work on behalf of the potassium , could be openly written about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do this ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in h@@ ash@@ em@@ itic kingdom , it is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian News Service started several former government officials and members of the teachers , with the reas@@ oning , they had critical about the problems in social media , related to the deeply ro@@ oted in the country .
in view of its opinion , H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s concert is only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to act a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for him is progress a permanent give and take . Jordan has denied a appearance but the way of progress - such as H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ time and inner changes . he is sure that these changes are held from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arab@@ s , from a Arab world without inter@@ ventions abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is not only dre@@ aming about his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is argu@@ ed with music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , stre@@ et@@ itions and on artificial way her@@ ed@@ backs demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hop@@ ed this .
until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is going on and therefore also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ps are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals , which is usually held in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory that the drums and dancing went over over a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous people of the region , to force the indigenous people of the region .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( lit@@ t@@ l .
I had long look at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two cars are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival takes the only tru@@ e - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fortress was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this story because they help to stop the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical centre of Lima , in a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dressing into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , which can recre@@ ate these magnificent hair@@ dos .
the exceptional demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there will be an expert in order to show who can create the most ec@@ cent@@ ric g@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos about current competitions , there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to s@@ wap their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice that enables them to find work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; motivated by this activity and the options , dozens of young people saw that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district of which we are very proud , because of love among the children we built this educational community .
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to gu@@ er@@ illa

the following article is the revised version of the &quot; Liebes@@ bot@@ anist to Guer@@ illery , &quot; published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the post will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel e@@ jected to bring affection ?
this is exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os , from the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired her to write the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ w@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( letters for reconciliation ) , who encourage young people to write letters letters .
only recently , her country was the ground of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to her part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian Government concluded a peace agreement with the Guer@@ ill@@ a@@ Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was the signing of the peace agreement as important that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in front of the Colombia , there is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ err@@ illa , who have lived for many years in illegal camps , were subjected to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock their weapons has to be turned into life as civilians .
Colom@@ bian society , the Colom@@ bian society , which had used to life in constant fear and in some cases , they have to record their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colombia and the integration process would have to help .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former Guer@@ ill@@ ers , to welcome them back in society .
the campaign &apos;s goal is 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former gu@@ ill@@ ary strug@@ gles - to be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day for the Campaign
the idea for reconciliation also took place on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ , February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need much more necessary .
he plane , he told him to share his love with people this year , which needed most urgent action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who now will have their place in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me . &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camps in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19 .
a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves as they did earlier in order to gain the prec@@ epts of their leaders .
but this time they did not get prec@@ epts , but letters full of submission from all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that between is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political scientist of Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff member of the Governor &apos;s province Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience so :
after passing through the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of Guer@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ er@@ illa @-@ fights ) saw I saw a gu@@ er@@ aser , who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go there , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answering said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; then I suddenly ran the tears over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him whole , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry , he was sorry to be all those years of faithful compan@@ ions of this fighting , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society there , with open arms waiting for us .
until now , I have learned to learn how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
students were all grown up as early as war , and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC performed their ide@@ als and insight into their opinions on the peace process : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years , we have experienced how the social in@@ justice were able to develop us to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one purpose of these mag@@ n@@ itude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those people who have never seen and no choices have never seen and even lear@@ nt that people who have often seen as monsters and even hate them that were filmed by their living conditions and the environment , was very painful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reality , where the country lives , doesn &apos;t hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and have done so much damage to us and give us a smile and a hug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town Cal@@ i , the following letter :
Colombia became proph@@ es@@ ied that would rule peace after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to lift up and protest for her rights . and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
we from F@@ ARC now rely on peace to a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , because we know from your own experience , that nothing is easy . among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

this is the translation of an article written by our affili@@ ates A@@ ida Mir@@ mac@@ sum@@ ova and its first publication on the OC Media website .
hom@@ osex@@ ual and Que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a large bandwidth of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror , activists took over the coverage of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on the LGB@@ T community , is not only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , which has shared some of their experiences with us and spoke with us what is currently happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T law in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines in front of several months after reports published their deteri@@ oration , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya authorities , the susp@@ icious que@@ ens men , and they put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt her childhood in her childhood that she was a woman in reality .
when they grew up , it became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for them , so they went to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens had experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , hunting was opened at Sabrina .
in fear of her life she moved to the United States last duck .
Sabrina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per at a human rights organisation .
one day someone told me that somebody needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman , which was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while I tried to help her , someone thought of whom I thought he would be a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there was no men more in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya who can remove this dis@@ grace ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing there was a few shopping facilities from the back home of my car , I heard a male first say : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around myself , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time at Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honour the family , you shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke the last end of the hospital again .
apparently some women had to get everything and started singing .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two sun@@ k in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which nurse were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name . but the doctor stood and laid me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got to thre@@ ats .
they called me , they wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ club .
my family was visited by neigh@@ bors and some distant relatives .
the desired to send me to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they raised absurd claims : some said to me , I m@@ uts to prove that in the above without through the streets ; others said that I did not change my gender in the official television , that everything was only bad , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people said my mother on the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic has damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around the neck .
fortunately , the neighbours and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with dark window discs and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it was clear that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you bra@@ ided ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ belie@@ vable .
I can &apos;t compreh@@ end , as it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without sign up , without identification , without anything else .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the tr@@ ash .
came and check@@ ered into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe me , you are in safety only because you left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel du kno@@ ck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , however , this is an issue .
I always carry some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements yet in me .
so very I wish to overcome this se@@ el@@ ian barrier I can not overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give myself effort to look like the person , which it reminds of their past - so to my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who are d@@ ort@@ ly ?
Sabrina : I got a report in Washington last week .
I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
I spoke to anyone who had dinner one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an had no man arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that my i , they probably load the relatives , they take care of the affected person and at the end asking a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caused by blood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are now even gay men tra@@ pped in these secret products ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there were not very many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or those of their relatives were left to imagine the Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present later than terror@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they should have attacked your village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people weren &apos;t just van@@ ished , but purpos@@ ed to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is it just a delay or have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new of them since .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was taken away when these people were taken .
until now they were not introduced as band@@ its , there were no reports until now . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible .
why would it not be allowed to shave this man ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people listening to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already been found in the past ?
Sabrina : I wore my hair always long .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think it was known already in 2003 , when I was still living there - and I never had problems .
serious in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to lead us originally to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civi@@ lization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ultimately caused us into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows were fl@@ ared ; I had colored eyelashes , wore red@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria never has a hair curved .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a small place where several banks were , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never ins@@ ulting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ ch@@ n@@ yan language there is a phr@@ ase : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say to children , when they make fun of sick .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you because they believed they were sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted me , never ch@@ ased , and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did this gift for grace ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row came up to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about mor@@ ality in television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily through the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
who had laugh@@ ed before and laugh@@ ed at once , viewed at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the period , I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you work now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I send them to the hospital and help them to get food card .
I have no cents for this .
I discovered these people themselves , when I stum@@ bled a refuge .
I am Muslim and I want to help you need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that is al@@ ous .
this is the nature that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens that proph@@ es@@ ied with foam in front of the mouth that there is no h@@ ow@@ ls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Kab@@ ard@@ iner who have the Russians also , who are on all the planet , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is anno@@ ying to hear something .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and fast@@ en during Ram@@ ad@@ an fast@@ en - live with men .
do you know , many think about tran@@ si@@ dent@@ ism in men who love men , and believe that you should be his sex to make more intimate experiences , but that &apos;s a tru@@ sion .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry , I &apos;m so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not so sad at all , so I know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n ahead of an increase of suicide within the pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last months there has been a strong rise of self @-@ moral . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab Workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ mad@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ combustion of a man named Jas@@ si@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , influenced by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had one child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed for his own assistance to come to the in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Human Rights , who want to work and remain anonymous .
this video held on YouTube held the moments after he had set itself ign@@ ited , firm .
some people made it fast to clear the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ Ã­n hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists in front of the site that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hang@@ over .
their stories have one thing in common : there were all family people who were able to feed their families due to persecution on the Iranian government , feeding their families and pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer poverty , unemployment and discrimination
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region , which is a major part of the Arab ancest@@ or community living in Iran , was severely affected by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to deny its living . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power over and in 1925 to end great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most inher@@ ited and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continued to grow slowly , and the native population has only little of this wealth .
it often is victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and discharge .
the Iranian regime denied the ancest@@ or az@@ i Arab@@ s system@@ atically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom .
these dam@@ s only resulted in the devast@@ ation caused by d@@ rought caused devast@@ ation , and local agriculture as well as the local agriculture and palm trees .
the unemployment rate amongst the Arab @-@ Hawai@@ ian youth rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director of Co@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed elementary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and have a degree of university degree .
a systematic strategy that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high increase &quot; of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that the majority of unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of emerging Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the process process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since officials and institutions does not require Arab labour , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to working opportunities in all sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance to young Arab@@ s and to earn their living outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are people who had to hide their first and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated by the workplace , for speaking Arabic language or We@@ ar of Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances , the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , strike human activ@@ ist alert before the situation will explo@@ sively .
it remains in wait to see if the world is w@@ aking up and knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why don &apos;t I identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ality &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the comments written by Ay@@ om@@ ide zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women respond - especially white women , who call themselves as an inter@@ continental femin@@ ists - with fru@@ str@@ ation .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists .
for example , women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women still remain under strict observation , if it comes about what they may do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women so@@ oner or later changes in various fields of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced of that and I suffer double and triple , among them .
I am a black woman .
yet , if I speak to skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I say always on what kind of physical , se@@ el@@ ic and verb@@ al would have been ab@@ used , as well as outside of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists have been decided to keep silent femin@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but nevertheless , they all agree that women - all women have to come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lifting their voices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing their votes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which we are exposed to black women in two times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities as well as white men and women earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often at school are identified as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women have been exposed to a higher risk in black spher@@ es and women with migrant back@@ grounds , domestic violence and violence , as white women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , I want all men , all men and all human rights have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join the same rights as a black woman who ref@@ uses to consider in@@ justice in their thinking , which relate to the sex @-@ color of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist spy that has always refused me and countless other black women again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner said in their speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I no woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to connect with group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will no longer try to specify white women the importance of tri@@ mming of skin color and sex . because some of them still try to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different approach and restri@@ ct from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I draw it , full and completely different from femin@@ ism and initi@@ ating me of femin@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman &apos;s life , instead of me a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly celebrated as a novel phenomenon is celebrated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define black women in our own ideas and give us into the sphere that are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ iming O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves in that way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ el@@ ic , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed to the black woman .
although some white and internal femin@@ ists are immediately cry separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can lift black women and women other cultures than in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m due to my dark skin and due to my existence .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in a environment , in which my life has neither sur@@ passed , nor denied it will be rejected .
p@@ iti@@ oning against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
under a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again , Nabil Mus@@ a traveled again in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who told us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution in his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam , contamination , and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ epers from Iraq , a subsidiary of the Water@@ mark Alliance - who sets up and work to protect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rivers , streams , and water paths in Iraq , as well as the local communities in sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we wouldn &apos;t have water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced and published by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmm@@ aker and multi @-@ medi@@ al journalist , produced in Er@@ bil , in Iraq .
the focus of their work lies at the ensu@@ ing , little acc@@ laimed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by using co@@ oper@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help can tell their stories in their ways .
Paraguay women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women const@@ itute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ ality in the country and in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ ier . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # female ) , which reports about violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the affected people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had been violent over violent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of her relationship , a time had passed and the police said , their statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman was Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , the acute display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was useful .
a few days later the second woman moved her ad back .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are viewing at all once , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men that they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all at all .
permanent 1 pun@@ ches and Statist@@ ical 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does not undergo imm@@ ati@@ t@@ 3 of the laws : good approach , lack of realization and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to realise how many women are really mis@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , a social scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various details and reports that show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the At@@ tor@@ ney General Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General , 9@@ 600 ads were due to domestic violence . at 70 % of them we went about violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically disabled , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi will actually appear only a few of these crimes . &quot; on every woman who will not do for psych@@ ic mist@@ re@@ acts , 9 women who do not do this .
for every woman who is suspected of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , explained them at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a private off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities cannot document appropriate , as many women killed each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists killed at least 12 cases of women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay is documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mis@@ uses and an legal system , which under@@ takes nothing
before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became strong friend of Carlos Vera , he in@@ sist@@ ed that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but after . this was supposed to regret it forever .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she brought the psychological violence against women , one of the most common forms of violence against women and simultaneously recogni@@ z@@ able :
I never thought that I would once again be victims of abuse .
if I read it earlier , I thought that only women have happened to be sub@@ du@@ ed because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report on the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic if he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mariana to have fallen this so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave it earlier .
it seemed almost so , as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have some contribut@@ ors to it .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , in order to prove that their former partner met her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psych@@ ic mist@@ re@@ acts .
her prosper@@ ous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads remained with the authorities without earnings and also from their relatives , she received no support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an im@@ pass@@ able judi@@ cial struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paraguay La@@ ws : good approach , def@@ icient implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not to be applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ak@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of law was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # FÃ¼r@@ y ) in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ entries ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law sees to explain Fem@@ iz@@ d to an independent off@@ ence to explain and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbor@@ ing countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the Legisl@@ ative text was modified in some points to make also the de@@ pu@@ ties for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay , and are punished by five years imprisonment .
the original bill is intended to have the bulk of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) procedure , which have to bear the victims of violence even themselves , if they simply want to furn@@ ish and make a safe accommodation to impos@@ e the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law does not be effective if the legisl@@ ature does not have sufficient financial resources for this :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
here , a change must take place , so that violence is not viewed as a slightly sle@@ ek .
those who keep silent about this facts , are guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators .
we need to refund so long display until failure does not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate was adopted , however , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage in cases of domestic violence was called for reconciliation .
opinions about the changes are going apart .
the reconciliation concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor , to attack his victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the string of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differs from parts of the law as a large set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ ier . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # female ro@@ bin ) , which reports about violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman have continued to ban on attacks in Oman a year
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage on corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and arrested before court , but came later again .
in 1970 , Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had made his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , he dis@@ gu@@ ised alongside his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Chief of Defence , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chairman of the Central Bank .
the rule of the s@@ ult@@ ans is characterized by the per@@ sever@@ ity of security forces , especially the public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , to restri@@ ct and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists to in@@ ti@@ mi@@ date and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities appro@@ ves peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights . activists , even activists , are also free to express their opinions on the public matters of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assault on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure and the detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , the security forces of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief of Az@@ am@@ n , was arrested , having appeared in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high ranking parties involved hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the report , government officials accused accused of lifting the Jud@@ gment in Oman under pressure to raise up judgment in a inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; High @-@ level Parties bind hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Board of Directors , charged by the ISS for the Special Department and on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had captured as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris .
the paper was closed on in@@ defin@@ ite period , after the Minister of Information had given the statement , &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced both among others because of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Under@@ standing of the State &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ating a audience of audience and s@@ lan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of pun@@ ishments and monetary policy in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) and was sentenced to one year of professional for@@ b@@ ade against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after having found the use of a source network for spreading material that could be found guilty of a danger for public order . &quot;
a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was granted for Al @-@ Abr@@ i and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Chamber pronounced Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after opening of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also concluded the order of the Ministry of Information , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the paper looks after attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued a statement that has been extended to the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; has been extended to three additional months and with which the minister was transferred again to the decision of the App@@ eals Court , the publication of the newspaper again .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been injured in Oman at recent times .
for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country to hire its operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j will be immediately released and un@@ conditi@@ on@@ ally released ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , creating their journalists in their work ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have hin@@ dered their legitim@@ ate human rights work , and without fear of corruption measures , including judi@@ cial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit organisation and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the support of Mein@@ l and association .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressed to one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research on site there are two reasons : to cover a lack in the global healthcare industry , many medicines and vacc@@ ines , who cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have far more serious impact than elsewhere , and lack of investments for research of these diseases by the Phar@@ m@@ af@@ ir@@ men are a major problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , will be able to develop its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for the research of inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS Epide@@ mic effect on national health showed .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research subject ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on application of research . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just launch a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostics tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion according to the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we just put solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be a receiver , rather than to be m@@ acher .
the solutions that we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it &apos;s impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or find here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which hind@@ ran@@ ces are there in your routine research that you did not have ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards developed in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods can be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion following the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age .
there is a special scientific training , beginning at every age .
the social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit .
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the required access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the U.S. to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producer change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad in the USA for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ded , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has only been given by its own acc@@ ru@@ dence and the question how many sal@@ ts can be given , limits are set .
but in the early 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he was not able to use them further .
the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or smo@@ ky leaves .
over the past years , more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ oons . due to these trends , plant bre@@ eders , environmental prot@@ ector and experts ensure nutrition security for the future of food production .
as a passion@@ ately representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mort@@ on is still growing , but now it takes longer because his work will always be worth more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when a river would lie in a river , around whom I need to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to make it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand before court , no one can breed out a new oint@@ ment , because all features are already patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is so good as possible and tries to breed those features , which he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is very c@@ auti@@ ous and ende@@ avo@@ red to use no material , which is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also joined a movement which is always greater in the U.S. and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have bred red tubes of the Sor@@ te Out@@ Editorial in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement from the IT sector comes and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was sum@@ mon@@ ed to ensure that some plant types and genes are not protected as intellectual property and so for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , shortly Os@@ si , US bre@@ eders can agree that others can use the seed @-@ free seeds freely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean that they can do not continue to business with their seed , and allow to cross it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ bre@@ eders allow to cross the seed to breed so own varieties , and it is not immediate - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
Professor Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , Professor Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , Professor Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg have control over seed and the possibility to breed new plants as well as for food safety and environmental protection .
according to seed , seed plays a role in greater cor@@ rid@@ ors such as biodiversity , rights of pe@@ as@@ ants , control over nutrition and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genet@@ ically modified plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables as it is , for example , should also know how the nature is bred , like this vegetables is threatened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
food so@@ vereign without seed confi@@ d@@ ability is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative committed to ensure others to keep seed more freely available . this means , in contrast , seed and plant features are to be patented .

Os@@ si supporters ar@@ gue that the future of food supplies are at risk of food , as the available gene pool because of the ever numerous mental intellectual rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited , free of shr@@ ink@@ age .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Os@@ si , engaged in her graduation with genet@@ ically variation on carrots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all the cart@@ oons are protected as intellectual property , which means it is usable for plant bre@@ eders .
for other plants there is still no estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ ac@@ ular plants such as wheat in more style are patented as salad or carrots .
a question of view
plants are cultivated so that they have specifically desired characteristics - from such , through which their flavor or their color improves up to such , due to those who flour@@ ish in certain environments , such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders dec@@ ei@@ ves more than ever before , because the modified conditions of climate change are much worse than ever .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to believes that genetic vari@@ ability is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four Gen@@ ban@@ ques and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is responsible for the preservation of genetic vari@@ ances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contra@@ dic@@ ts that intellectual property will promote other bre@@ eders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant variations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but promotes the public more material and know @-@ how to be provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the other : 20 years waiting until a patent is di@@ stra@@ cted , certainly no innovations .
and if you wait so long for you to breed plants , which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , the struggle would have been lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources should have been always a general , and it should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeding have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ical inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their jobs easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it &apos;s impossible to us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mort@@ on dis@@ appears to pat@@ enting the concept of plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not creating the characteristics itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they form them out and as bre@@ eders , ultimately , we have no idea how plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Os@@ si board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who breed a variety , consider its own values in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large villages and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed to cultiv@@ ate major changes in cultivation this concept of agriculture .
my concept is just wrong . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than for Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies - either refuse it or maintain it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding , or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative by avo@@ iding plant pat@@ ent@@ ability : &quot; it looks like I am producing with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies who are patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent one is being protected from competition for 20 years , with which one simply makes it quite simply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the U.S. seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept now spreads rapidly throughout the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed program operates the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties , which meet specific requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supports you to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation agreements is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si @-@ commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , not just one thing to be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive branch of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents applied on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a statement is not yet a law ; now it is the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa , to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for saving seeds .

a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity globally , to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a group of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and other - a report will have to be able to exchange and improve seeds and provide a stable supply with food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the report it also emphas@@ ises the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection with which Lu@@ by by Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will be able to recognise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods have been killed , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights organisation and blog are the latest c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian Auth@@ orities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remain bt@@ ful despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ending the freedom of freedom and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted , to overcome the lock and not give it . we hope to continue our task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first @-@ cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research institute Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no longer available in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ n@@ uns and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he set up for b@@ ypass the Egyptian government to avoid the goal of a attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which is native to zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he recorded a video about the student &apos;s prot@@ agonist , as he exerc@@ ised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly turning on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada commented on the lock through the government and reflected what it means for him :
the blogs , blogs , is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be important for the world , it is for me for me .
1 ) It has succeeded to con@@ vey the feeling of a siege system ; an arrest , a ver@@ ified murder , advance charges at the National Security Council , blocking blogs , and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only a small audience .
I &apos;d like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post items in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ orship .
but now , having blocked him , they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities locked technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , among others Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE is also documented the blocking of providers by passing internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , 12 June , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began to offer .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to block and filter content that could have access to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed that the ignition decisions were taken behind closed doors , which the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using it before court to act against this actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the residents are fighting .

day for day reports newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy Head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard mot@@ i@@ fs .
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day is murdered a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ be rau@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer will send 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air@@ w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a w@@ alled financial situation , the violent wave in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the United Nations Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization called the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these are always daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16 , Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced , a new column named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the mot@@ i@@ fs for their decision explained the paper :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual intercourse , etc . everything however only happens in the &quot; War &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes from the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that won &apos;t realize the war .
in the same video , a journalist wrote that it is according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the Editorial , the Newspaper writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we realize that a war dis@@ course when it is dis@@ rup@@ ted , even if it can be used , cru@@ ises the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions to dis@@ gu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and their partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they used ?
in an article on the Internet portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil argu@@ ing the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , however , argu@@ ing the violence as a &quot; war &quot; by the media and could make it difficult to draw for account@@ ability in police force .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in staff , investigation and historical and self @-@ known negle@@ ct of public service .
in the memory of Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

none of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .

in the beginning , this fact resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . since a few years the U@@ PP was supposed to protect the newly created police unit , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on his Facebook page , journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux explained from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio isn &apos;t stated by the Geneva Convention - Crit@@ eria for the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil war &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he writes :
aside from legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also re@@ jects serious consequences for the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this is required to use the state , the means and ways that are typical of war . this includes the entry into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lost balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loy@@ alist troops . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation , PA@@ X and the research institute , The Syria Institute , are currently in Damascus , and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons took the life of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations , that the massacre was administered by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , the areas controlled by re@@ bel control areas outside of Damascus , which led to the inhabitants of local authorities , or by tun@@ nels and control points have been instru@@ cted .
due to the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ reachable to large parts of the population .
as an attempt to capture a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to conventional food in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its food makes it an attractive food for many local residents of the besie@@ ged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct Direc@@ tion of the Project , Sub@@ scription Nabil , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has already been fighting for three years , and op@@ pressed his relief that it now wins more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use agreement with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do .
it is planned to bring 125 families knowledge to the plant@@ ing of mushrooms , Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do in September 2017 .
the initiative is based on generators that hold temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ age , plastic fuel manufactured substances are used to feed the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Global Vo@@ ices said that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the Reg@@ ions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality , whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a pan . when this was done , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
they have now created a &quot; teaching yard for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed fung@@ i throughout the Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the pilgrims from different reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break@@ age of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ supply , by eating remains ( like paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for ob@@ taining new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .

Portuguese demand for justice for the victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people were protest@@ ing on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were grass in the north of Portugal .
two and forty persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government that the government had proclaimed a national road for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread across the northern and centrally located regions of the country , reaching about 250 million hectares of forests and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande was a similar tragedy where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured in fires .
according to the European forest monitoring system that monitors the forest surfaces by satellite recordings , in Portugal alone , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the Lisbon area .
so you can make a better image from the Ernst of the location : there is no fire in 4 districts .
throughout Portugal , in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - N@@ ata ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) , 15th October , 2017
some of Twitter users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the happening :
the ab@@ sent@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why civil protection wasn &apos;t able to prevent the extent of tragedy so far as possible
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al issued by the Federation of farmers from Portugal , the P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper stated :
in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of sites from open streets , which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy would have been able to happen again , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits are subject to a high fire of Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far reaching proposal to Wal@@ vis , who had brought the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was requested by the municip@@ alities who saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a determination of the law , which allowed the activity of the case , if the applic@@ ant had an open back@@ door , so that everything was built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val continued in the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environment agency Quer@@ cus made careful that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of slightly flamm@@ able wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of this kind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these problems will be added that the website of the civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people sought information or attemp@@ ting to contact relatives , offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a private initiative , provided the population with information provided by using f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and spread of fires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade in October so that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires , did not support the website more than half a million . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

in the fall of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din groups who had conquered the short @-@ lived per @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ f Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say so , she knew she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
the boy should break up in the morning .
his uncle would pick it up and bring him to the locks .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara had suddenly made us@@ eless .
the Taliban &apos;s H@@ ass on Haz@@ ara &apos;s famous Taliban were always near@@ er .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
a couple of years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ itation . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of its low salary , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow sacks with mort@@ ars who were he@@ avier than he himself , to earn his living .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran imp@@ acted by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan Refu@@ ge@@ es ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we worked .
there was no service there and no heating . we hang@@ ed nylon in front of the open windows , so that we cannot hear at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ f left his life without papers in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ f came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ f was hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church which shared twice a day of food .
it is true that Italy is due to relatively high demand levels a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are in the country , cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the Civil Liber@@ ties Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers &quot; from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers is accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special Recording centers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impro@@ vised by impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be shared if they officially have a request for asylum - what after registration of the asylum seek@@ ers can go for months .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either instru@@ cted to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there were also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his in@@ fam@@ ation of life helped A@@ shar@@ f , soon to free from these conditions .
after spending several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ f opened his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while and a Schn@@ el@@ limb@@ ite was opened .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is Success Story is now topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for credits are only some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , around 20,000 Afghan people live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afghan companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells us about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the story of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to extend far beyond Italian food industry and retail and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave teen@@ agers .
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ f with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happ@@ ily , when I know that my people suffer .
I have a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ f is also plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which people can learn packaging and con@@ serv@@ icing techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
development to the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through in@@ security and dou@@ bts , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ f has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afghan people on this path .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Net@@ i@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot that shows challenges , victories , and upcoming trends in global internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament ver@@ i@@ fies a bill of law , which pre@@ suppose that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to be able to use the social networks within six months of succes@@ ful law of law on the website of the authority , indic@@ ating their full name and their ID .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of prison or penalty of penalty .
the law , which was advert@@ ised by six@@ ty members of par@@ liament@@ arians , is currently under legisl@@ ative as well as the Parliament &apos;s constitutional committee and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , a legisl@@ ative proposal filed a bill to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ulting of the President or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ulting of the presi@@ dents and state institutions are already pun@@ ish@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but under the law a such deed would be pun@@ ish@@ able with prison and monetary policy , right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for convicted .
Moreover , this would have a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
an interesting example is the case of the Egyptian photograph@@ ers Mah@@ m@@ oud plan Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was photograph@@ ed on 13 August 2013 when he was demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators that brought violence against the military coup d president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited as more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison for a court of jurisdiction .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison line failed to work with human rights groups to bring the accused of prison in the court@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threat@@ ening the death penalty , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ burden of such acts , illegal gathering , murder and su@@ red@@ ly murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza was acquitted on two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the previously mentioned incident , aged 25 years to 5 years .

in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the stop of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been resear@@ ched mainly to a continuous action plan . Bes@@ ag@@ ated plan is supported by the President of the Republic , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Ab@@ id@@ ine Ben Ali , who would ensure that all un@@ lawful funds will return .
this document released on 21 April on the page of Na@@ wa@@ at document , th@@ rows a light on how the pre@@ si@@ di@@ al plans look to the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources , indic@@ ating Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press @-@ complex which journalists protects the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the Tunis District Court on 09 . may as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to present their ID correctly ?
according to new rules of information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , social media in China require permission to write or share news in social media .
in the provisions , also stated that registration will be required with full real names .
analy@@ st susp@@ ects that this will be achieved by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in Entertainment within social networks , until now it is un@@ clear how the authorities apply to this prescri@@ ption .
Chinese networks proposed in social media to impos@@ e these rules only sel@@ ectively to protect civil journ@@ alism and independence .
