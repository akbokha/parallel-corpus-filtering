<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceedingly great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have learned to American music, American authors read and operated.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a deep impact on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter served with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-Student, who had inclined the Supreme Court to judge his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after Method Man," "" "I was it, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said:" "" "America is the only country where I ever lived, its diversity is so inviting that you are ever and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very strange love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, as it is surrounded with its narrow-minded ness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latino, AfroAmerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, people responded to his testimony and agreed in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won by republican elections, was the highest number that won by the Party of nominate candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that supporting this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters to meet the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, undertake people from all over the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could entertain me about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Trumps world view doesn't agree with the current publisher of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, were my mentors who helped me a lot at my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who embodied values deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">During Trump his way to nominate republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and counterpart to its restricted vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or maybe due to its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they shared either his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as a lawsists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most white are, for Trump, because they would like to recover the control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, hardly anyone can forget the words of David Remnick, who gives the cruel decision to rise a man, look at contempt on those looking different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Anm.).: as much as" "" "White against all other ethnication;" "" "pinception of white into play on the White and whiplash, what's the great Van Jones called" "" "did this great Van Jones" "" "did exactly that which America did so magnificent." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - what belief or background you may always have, America is welcome every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose the son of an Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with manifold, religious freedom and all the term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of choice." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally of Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud voice, "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"did Latino have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and powerful "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is this not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican Music School of the Vicente Guerrero Church in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the paraguaian city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places is not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby distinctive ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years, the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) is now playing in the municipality: one of the children and adults of existing symphony orchestra which has an opportunity for overcoming poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school of 100 students has become the central interest for the parish of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drug abuse and the gangs fire.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare hopelage.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take seriously their obligations towards the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from the school, they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to reflect their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come together and play with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you meet day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically above the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay, which are produced from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reopened instruments, made of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycler began to transform parts of waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments were imitated violins, viola, celli, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets and percussion all from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez remembers a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no place for the rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked not any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was something shown that he had never seen before: a violin was produced.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra which is based on instruments made from recycled material and joins The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces approximately one billion tonnes of trash each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the doctors, like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from garbage to music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that specifically talks about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication happens within the framework of a Global Voices for shared use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing waters before it was searching other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">"" "" "" "the East African countries were thus untilted and slightly tilted to welcome a bill of law to their coasts." ""</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Compores, Mozambique and the Seychelles are quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Premier surrounded by countries, which you simply refused everything" "", "is Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was forced to pay 2 million dollars to Liberia because of pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, to cross criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO Stop illegal fishing (Illegal Fisheries stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries who had driven the Premier out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries to work and work together. they exchange information and stand up each other, where it is illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden because it is extremely difficult. this is illegal fishing a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate disregard of existing laws, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm the illegal fishing ecosystem that have a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing have been hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and through the snow-emptempo, with information between individual countries, these actions happen in real time, with tracking at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries, for example, exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port inspections.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move at the open lake, by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships which fish in forbidden areas - such as suspicious driving routes - such as such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such examinations can show if the involved ships have a fishing licence where they were on the way and possibly if they have a Criminal register.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can be refused to accept such ships in their harbours. what means that ships could not sell their cargo. and that they could even be forced to play against penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it's about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing are not financially worthwhile anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that puts himself for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win a estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen that invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish in East Africa, which attracts the region's commercial fishing industry. among these also the other illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Other practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying fantasy species, fish protected species and fishing in protected areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship was illegal fishing and a country could then say" "" "You must not run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Comm to me'. "and exactly this legale loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations.</seg>
<seg id="127">"" "" "" "it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread counterfeit licences in Tanzania." "" "" "" it discovered ships who used multiple fraudulent identities and found it "" "" pursuing ships "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with Interpol, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing via large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system to help FISH-i to get suspects ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be developed further will also help to hide the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "Illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "and we try to cross their position," "" "Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch for example their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be gedled by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Therefore, Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it is said to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team can actually influence the global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each tracking vessel worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of it, who knows what is doing," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to join one and their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, where a global system allowes persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only feeling criminals, but they also locusts.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that have been fished in earlier without license, and have hardly ever expected consequences, know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile buy a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats can buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had assisted Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, their commitment is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force, and now they fight against illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "the goal is to allow even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's recent member of Somalia were able to sign his first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was travelling under false flag. and not only the ship was travelling without license, which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also drilled in forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview of Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was previously published on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, a Argentinian message page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said now in the context of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial began on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano didn't choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he kept family secrecy for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at 15, you do not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not realise that my father was a thief, folks and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a deputy officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship of 1974-1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division in prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Filing recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, which is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had witnessed over the years the extent of the atrocities which he had witnessed a boy, and he said before a court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows that great power has a parent over his child, and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy, the martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you are friends with one of the ERP.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for spreading translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For example, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transmit it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in case of native language. generally, the belief that translators should be in the target language - not in the native language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native language, for example, translating from English to French, not the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as native language to translate the translations into English. this may be attributable to translation, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English language skills to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, which have no foreign employees, leave translations into service internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge becomes the best, translator - no matter how good or bad its language skills are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The veritable and petalled sentences are developed by machine translation that this technique can not replace yet long as a human translators. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the ralled reprints, often used T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stilistical reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. but of large companies or from the government to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, documented in the northeast Japan's daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress which were hit in the last six years, a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung is located in Sendai, which is in the prefecture of Miyagi, prefectures in Japan's prefecture, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring events Fukushima and Iwate were forced to attack, because the tsunami had to vanish whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, and alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows how the advances were achieved six years later, in order to rebuild the life of the local area.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese rebuilding authority as well as poll results of the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (in the street-party, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi could record the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima joined the closing light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the disaster, one still tries to settle after the catastrophe, evacuated by accommodation categories (in the street, Caucassu itutaku) into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the people of Fukushima still live in emergency accommodations in 2011, whereas I was more than 75 per cent of the evacuated ones that were hauled after the disaster in Behelfswald, were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the disaster, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction is more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">During almost 100 per cent of the fishing port in Iwate and Miyagi, in Fukushima, only 30 percent of the fishing port are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have grown large-scale in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 per cent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ground in Fukushima, are located in the nuclear zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered well, but Fukushima still remains undefeated here.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back 90 percent on the same booth as before the disaster. Fukushima can exhibit here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is native people prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine a whole picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacuated people. she asked them about the state of rebuilding, as well as their feeling of feeling against the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo introduced a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">Interrogation provided that 83.1 percent of local resident population, measures took hold in order to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in disasters prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the position of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Prekushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic accident, which had to take part in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, there were some more than 23 000 people back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the stand of 2017, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside its native prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuated areas, most of the event will fail to get back in the construction work, because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will compete with massive construction projects. this involves building projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="627">The municipality Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill, regardless of that there is no significant sugar beers on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were lame in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the rise, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost its facilities until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves anew.</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds exactly that in MaÃ±alich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>

<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically dated, and hardly competitive, they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the sugar cost rose before approximately one decade.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report, "Agricultural Perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and agricultural organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the present production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to swallow them, they also listened to the road to asphalted, this disadvantaged also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look up other factories.</seg>

<seg id="786">For me, it is, as if they have lost ones who have lost someone and those who are afraid, they also have such something.</seg>

<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years ago when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody husband of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez saw:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>

<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically from atrocities where they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bushes.</seg>

<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count Leichen," "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>

<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (inclusions) that go through this post. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence about the silence of Christians through Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the murder of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images will be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens if readers cannot give any longer faith to these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are few people who are unintended to have the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugars this moods of the mis- and false information that real atrocities are untrue and flushes it from what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent pictures has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even required by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is to feel violent more readers and viewers despicable and empathy the ability to feel empathy (such as violent media seem to help others to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss violent representations in the news media, fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News" in which a picture suggests a bit suggests, which actually can be derived from the context or completely undispense.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every examination should be false concessions, however, should also consider how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. inexchangeable) tries to offer voice enthrities from all over the world, which are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in each language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unnecessary words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others, which are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish soretesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all are stubbornly persistent every attempt to an easy translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, for example words, you can find words from Vanuatu Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - BemÃ¼h to your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- The comfort or sloth you feel after being heated in cold days in the sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They distrains other cultures, unveil other things, and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, you influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this site, and show more of these "untranslated" words, and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be an option, here and now in spite of a language barrier to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative of Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Unremovable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or in Oakland, in the United States, where TLS has been carried out since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not given to the native children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of this project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we do the cities which have not forgotten the diversity, in which inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to be eligible.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening is often associated to understand," "" "purposes these events instead" "" "listening to appreciate, to feel, to link." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers make their story first in their own language and translate, or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if participants are not a professional storytellers, their surrender and their representation is that the listeners insisted on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional history dating from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou consulates also the opportunity to explain the history of customs of narrative.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the beak of the Hoses and the Pavian in the language of Shona:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after he explains the meaning of his foot, John Nyamusara is asked," "" "How is it that you don't understand?" "" "he shares his language with a wide countess:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. everyone who are inspired by the project can contact TLS in contact with TLS.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missed for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he did for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">During this year's re: publica, annual conference on digital culture, hosted in Berlin, dedicated to the event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inner (The Cost of Freedom: a collective afterresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published in the last year was released and licensed here, contains a number of paragraphs that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements can be set up for free knowledge and what is the true cost, with which it is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artist, designer, researchers, researchers, researchers, researchers, researchers and writers, have been working on site to watch over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something different from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, imprisoned and celebrated Internet volunteers since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted on the Adra prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and want to know him back in its normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own fates, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">For what do we have chosen?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad administration, and they informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his dwelling place and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in expanding the Internet and to know how to open the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and currently survived the leader of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes were more looking than the work that he started to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the crossing of numerous civilizations and here merging Greek-Roman architectural models with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel didn't even know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would put all this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike in the digital Archaeology and Conservation has created a period of time, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not yet shut up this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my overall life to dream of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed, when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught others to use them how they use computers, at least theoretical, without that they actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a trial log that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together a year along with the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption discovered by a government member, after half his sentence of his sentence, returned to the corruption in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants with four other defendants (around 800 000 Euro) and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called his return to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General in the Republic of the Republic, there would be no obstacle reason for Cambaza, back to his old post as the company was no disciplinary procedure after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution responsible for public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to remark the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the absence of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we have to know is that the company should have intoxicated by the company." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company remained silent, however, and does not include appropriate legal steps for the application of respective functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and consider the case as" "" "resistible" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had dinner.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But because he is incompetent, he has approved to reintegrate into the company, which he helped to harm damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">So it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Refute!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science, says the director of no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza rewarded by the state, because he bellied to him, I cannot believe someone in such a way that has already insulted the state so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lack the morals to come back and serve the state, * he had already been serving a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it is only served by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as handles it for an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself is wearied, and was finally condemned to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers it to remember the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Diebe belong to the prison Samora Mahel, not only to be remembered as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, single-cut and - even as a sharp, prophetic editor.</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means Kichererbse or spoage.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network recorded their posters from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Even though it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to reject people from the native origin or in general as adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is censored by the word "Kalar" (in Burmese Scriptures) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hassin Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascent of radical nationalistic movements gave the word an extremely effective connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word which mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hassspeak against Muslims who represent a minority of population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the efforts to fight Hassin Myanmar in Myanmar, the company has a lot of sensual content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar's may normally be associated with racism in connection, but the word of itself does not call herself hassle.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that, in which they discussed the use of the word or doubt, in purpose of his usage, have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several burmesial words with fundamental meanings which have the same letter sequence such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letter as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(spelling),' Kalar Oat '(veil) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboothing Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends has been deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends for a spiritual way whether they could wush as he could alleviate his back pain, giving himself a word of word.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win HER is the opinion that they decrease to radially radically nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic can be analytic before it disseminate all the postage that suspect racism to suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automaticism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking the right words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(age-age).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these trickigen nationalists who are spreading the hate, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all the hate language, the efficiency of this strategy may not be long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">"" "" "" "the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords are often a cat and mouse game, where users can simply start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views." ""</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to clear his posts when he wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to share post and share content for 24 hours, because the post" "" "Facebook Community" "" "has not corresponded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hassspeak radikaler nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author distributed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are badly damaged in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the initiative of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a well-looking intent to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to zenge will only bring more hatred inside the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "Moreover, it seems as if they have started this without any local context or technical support, as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "Patrisencurry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found that they made mistakes, they did not tempt the falsified Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that make them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has made good care for users among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are doing fun and write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their postings are taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no Hassaria, but still removed:</seg>

<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his saying that criticises the wuthering hassle on his Burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of defining the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The nursery before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago to be illegal.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously decided to offer a law that is to offer this practice, so that the advisable age is at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of marriage took some members, and Muslim religious communities, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj told, a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country, that the state should not interfere in the state, since that, age is not the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has been a contracting partner of UN's legal prevention, the minors as well as to any people under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">The UN's statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago is 2.8 percent, and with 18 there were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the official statistics of the country confirmed that by 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that endeavours to abolish laws on the children's before, followed at the foot and rejoiced great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leaders, for example, had no concern about telling the critics of the children's before they should be condemned to take care of their own matters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition cared for tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point in doubt, whether the opposition would agree with the bill of law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill of law was decided against the children's before - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent that contained himself contained in the House of Representatives, where already a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update to Facebook, the Leslie-Ann Boiselle at Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of bill against the child's before was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes, and no one voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he had decided before the Senate, the draft will now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws on the child's before were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who was a Minister of Ministers in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which has veiled the core of it, but do you know what? the child's before is illegal and Tobago is almost worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel's opinion was, it was definitely long enough to create the practice was Lara Quentre-Thomas convinced that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update to Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, "Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 on it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belong to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law be noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious ceremonies 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The design to change the marriage was approved today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 MPs in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members who were against were voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The Children's Day is in Trinidad and Tobago not permitted by law anymore.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childrageway abuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who have forested him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thanks to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook is in the form of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps, should the law be adopted, and he seems to have his promise to be redeemed.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "during the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a advocate of the law, it would be quite right if Maharaj wish to proceed against the law, the most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if, instead of keeping the discussion so generally, in a way that we would like to talk about the state in our bedroom, that they may cause them from big, hard-mentioned men who are opposed to them, would you be willing to carry on the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children's before in different abouts remain legal or even the norm, although there is laws that they may sign.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia site was presented on January 18, 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the USA, internationally evaporated.</seg>

<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series will fight against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques used are used to use locking tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not exist in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been deported from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, you will find regular blockings of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most well-known country in the world when it comes to a massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, several Mirrorpages (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia are also oftenly updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform leaves all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator calculator), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is also callable despite legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS tells about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. this is the possibility to read the content of decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help the users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was conducted independently by the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklope.org, an open source project that everyone can use to host a similar Mirrorsides, if imprisoned in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>

<seg id="1410">One is accessing another URL, which is not the original one. that's what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server guides the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself when this is locked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1418">The motivated him to wear a camera with him and trying to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar is trying to make Neptar, Neptune wildlife on the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home office right next to Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that goes attention to Neptune wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, as it helps him this first class situation at his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Parks, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wild photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home, when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) cried. he had received a call from my father, that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was, and I immediately began to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to gain a cooperation with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal and wants to understand that wild animals are not so furious, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"" "and he should know it, because he had already been tigers from face to face toward:" ""</seg>

<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also at home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the Buhek appeared. he is immediately going to see us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly stayed in a tent while in the Bardia National Park recording of Otters. up to 12 days it lasted until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist resorts.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care, the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a ponomic or say "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they should respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should be aware of the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state of Odaa by a headcourt and dispersed by her family and the village community after they had a married relatives with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition also not call their wives by name is also widespread among men. however, they have far less assignments to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel, and housewives, a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">"" "" "" "it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the enemy's enemy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that is in 13 Indian countries, he is part of the campaign # Khelbadal, which is operated by the community video Volunteer and set aside for the removal of the Patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages those clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs created a safe place for those women and they made it at the same time at the bottom of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in her discussion round, did not know women who did not call their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided on this subject because they wanted to open the patriarchate with a problem with which the women could identify easily.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "the names of their husbands will not speak loudly, so that they have not guilty on all paid and never questioned." ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini comments:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition confirms that a woman wishes her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not agree, is considered a darker, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband, had never been called by name, how it is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband were silent after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started its first discussion with this confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never heard before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to put the discussion with a practice in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us to respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," "" "says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the porridge of a centuries old tradition who married women the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she stopped during the whole exercise, and another decided to let him out all the united Frustration against him and his family, by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In addition, adrenaline was still struggling with an ancient rock, the women decided that they would actually try home to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in his head, his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she stared, she was afraid, saying that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understandable and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports like women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred point on the forehead, showing the spicious status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would bear the chin-red point if he did." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard that to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but they think they are now in a better position, even to choose him not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at any discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want women to worry who could hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last few months she celebrated their own birthdays with cake; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have done about some things, for example how our identities are made to our husbands, never said to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to tell certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only bore Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is this okay, but some wanted a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, wear it not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own coat-selection, morality is connected with the Saris and more, smuggled Rohini her own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can carry Jeans and Rohini is sure they can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion group, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women have tried it a few times, but then we listened to her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now contribute to each time Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion group know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the claiming for more freedom of movement or their own coat-selection - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a sacrifice of Patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club each of us gives confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman enters the club home and tell other people what we talk about what we are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has moved in international community attention when his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," after having committed himself to the draft of the Charta, a manifesto that calls the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Lius Case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and a speaker tells me to discuss this thing with some other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China is still receiving calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him to permit a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely out of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summed up some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment if the United Nations should exert pressure to facilitate Liu abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Minister of Ministers in Erna Solberg and Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into the Stocks, after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian Government finally did nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations only continued until December last year. Norway signed an agreement in June to record the salmon, since the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee brought his hope for an unconditional release and invited Ms. Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to gain his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was prompted to free Liu and his wife without delay and allow him to seek medical support, where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, called for the release of China on the release of Lius, as in a statement on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We expect to raise all limitations of Mr. Lius wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1657">The U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally release.</seg>

<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China requested to provide appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to abandon himself from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius Advocate told AFP before that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to contact someone outside, including its lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells you:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada requires China to preserve its international human rights, including freedom of expression, to preserve and to release them for exercising this rights.</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures have to be taken in order to ensure that Liu Xiaobo will receive all treatments, which he, regardless where, needed. furthermore, his wife and his family can contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news of France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was announced that there will be no other information that France would ultimately receive him.</seg>

<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed herself in a declaration on June 28 at Liu very worried and asked that many have asked him to pray for Lius wellbeing.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was considered a town.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting in the meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people were criticised by the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered a town.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, where most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the judicial minister," "" "the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifictions to create this precious country, we hear that we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the appearance of a escape before the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons made by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of its, he appeared irrevocally undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, both cities that are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the subject, the good old bodies of the authoritarian feeders appears to be the precursed democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">At the end of the last week Shanmugam given answers to his American guests regarding our press, Judiciative, our political system truly non-answer.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions tarred with non-Ansational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point where he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing on the blog his comment, he wrote about the critics that you should begin to read the entire codex of the conference, so that in the context of the testimonies of Shanmugam could be better, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he declared why the elections in Singapore was so unequal, even if we enjoy ourselves free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He made Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities had a party to win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore was no country," "" "he obviously spoke it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, which makes a leading of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>

<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he defends.</seg>

<seg id="1805">Over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abchasian war officially ended, but its scars are still visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tsararchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the carbon monks of Abchasies.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, depreciation, Georgian and Armenians lived and worked to Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and chases are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called by violas in AbchAsia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war era there were more than 10,000 people, today there are only a few hundred people in this vaulted city.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tsararchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of 16,000 people had barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">About 43.000 people lived in this district in 1989.</seg>

<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a korallen-pink Brillenframe and gold colored rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the premise there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and haitian immigrants come here.</seg>

<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is still quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already been sleeping on the boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buys them medicines that they can't pay, they massaged them with a balm that exhausts them away from the long journey.</seg>

<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, the app is said" "" "prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app before they were exchanged with a private WeChat group.</seg>

<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, from online scam, Trojans and phishing sites to help users to keep it online, and remote control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBT + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text, recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time inside; let him ride at his canvas, even to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his incarotenes covered with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where it had lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is a passionate activity which is transferred to the conservative majority and asks its old proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which deals with topics like Oriental, racism and the situation of Palestinian gearing up, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only valid in his hometown Amman Relevance, but also in cities that will take place from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders, and he can suffer according to their own statement by people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't open it openly, he stimulate a special inclination against the US-American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Taken by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"" "Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who have to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as" "" "Palestinian gearing of the second generation" "" "- so he himself was born even if he was born in Jordan, never before Palestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living conditions," stresses Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while he shook the nest in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is provided for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slaughtering lukewarm coffee and the swaist of the Kent-cigarette in the nose into the first place of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when looking at a glance into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From hence, it is easy to do basic things - as to the public during Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Interior Jordanian has said a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">A number of parliamentarians supporting the Islamic State Court - argued that sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamed Sinno, contradicts cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert tabs be.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MPs and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN says that the concert" "" "was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism which puts the old legitimacy authoritarian regimes in the whole region inquire.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila rated the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "" "which continues to use" "" "for intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to slow down rhetoric, but actually an increasingly challenging reality in Jordan reflects the appearance in Hdaibs's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib declined traditional gender norms by bursting his vision of the fate of Arabic women, having called vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a manifest unknown woman whose arms and legs extends up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years in Jordan the number of "honourmoral 'has increased - the unofficial outward left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch according to their climax; however, the number of honourable morals in 2016 reached its peak. however, Jordan continues to develop its institutional infrastructure to support the women who assented the victims of murder, or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law concerning the breaking news from the year 1954, women who are subjected to danger of domestic violence, "and for her release is often a yearlong bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it, also not to deceive topics in his country as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denied that his work is political, however, dreamt that he is his music, which is full of explicit announcements on sexuality, freedom and opinion, is not able to separate politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">For me, Politics was unanimous, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are in the core of politics can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which you can get in his words," "" "that which one wants to be" "" "- be faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">"" "he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan spoke about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on equality of LGBT + individuals still were strongly censored by 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan Onlineage Roya to remember that his comments were torn out of the context, twisted and censored by his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without incisions, but was only reworked version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBT + community and represents the opinion that intolerance on homosexuals did not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory with his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu NuWhat, who later should work on behalf of the potassium, could be openly written about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In hashemitic kingdom, it is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian News Service started several former government officials and members of the teachers, with the reasoning, they had critical about the problems in social media, related to the deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of its opinion, Hdaibs's concert is only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to act a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">"" "for him is progress a permanent give and take. Jordan has denied a appearance but the way of progress - such as Hdaib - consists of slow, bedtime and inner changes. he is sure that these changes are held from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society." ""</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from a Arab world without interventions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he is not only dreaming about his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is argued with music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streetitions and on artificial way heredbacks democracies. at least, he hoped this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is far, Hdaib is going on and therefore also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2182">The post will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel ejected to bring affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios, from the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired her to write the campaign cartas por la RewaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation), who encourage young people to write letters letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was the ground of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to her part: after years of negotiations the Colombian Government concluded a peace agreement with the GuerillaMovement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signing of the peace agreement as important that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its merits.</seg>

<seg id="2189">Guerrilla, who have lived for many years in illegal camps, were subjected to war rhetoric and around the clock their weapons has to be turned into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">Colombian society, the Colombian society, which had used to life in constant fear and in some cases, they have to record their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia and the integration process would have to help.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former Guerillers, to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's goal is 6900 letters - one for any former guillary struggles - to be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation also took place on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in BogotÃ¡, February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need much more necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2198">"" "so the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who now will have their place in society." "" "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me. '</seg>

<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves as they did earlier in order to gain the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not get precepts, but letters full of submission from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"" "it was a very moving moment for all involved." "" "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that between is," "" "the political scientist of Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff member of the Governor's province Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience so:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing through the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of Guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a kind of hut, where the guerilla-fights) saw I saw a gueraser, who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go there, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answering said," "" "I answer a letter which someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it. "then I suddenly ran the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him whole, and sat down beside the pomegate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry, he was sorry to be all those years of faithful companions of this fighting, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as war. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there, with open arms waiting for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have learned to learn how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace prevails, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>

<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>

<seg id="2223">"" "this is why the leaders of the FARC performed their ideals and insight into their opinions on the peace process:" "" "for many years, we have experienced how the social injustice were able to develop us to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this land."

<seg id="2228">"" "" "" "but it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and have done so much damage to us and give us a smile and a hug." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombia became prophesied that would rule peace after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to lift up and protest for her rights. and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from FARC now rely on peace to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, because we know from your own experience, that nothing is easy. among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent.</seg>

<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had to get everything and started singing.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>

<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>

<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their name, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't comprehend, as it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>

<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a delay or have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was taken away when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not introduced as bandits, there were no reports until now. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not be allowed to shave this man?</seg>

<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric if he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana to have fallen this so long by Carlos and didn't leave it earlier.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media. it is a growing area addressed to one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research on site there are two reasons: to cover a lack in the global healthcare industry, many medicines and vaccines, who cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious impact than elsewhere, and lack of investments for research of these diseases by the Pharmafirmen are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists, will be able to develop its own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS Epidemic effect on national health showed.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research subject?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on application of research. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just launch a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostics tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion according to the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we just put solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be a receiver, rather than to be macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it's impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or find here, because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which hindrances are there in your routine research that you did not have?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards developed in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods can be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion following the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a special scientific training, beginning at every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the required access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredded, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has only been given by its own accrudence and the question how many salts can be given, limits are set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But in the early 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he was not able to use them further.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or smoky leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cereal or cartoons. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmental protector and experts ensure nutrition security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionately representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still growing, but now it takes longer because his work will always be worth more restrictions.</seg>

<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was summoned to ensure that some plant types and genes are not protected as intellectual property and so for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, shortly Ossi, US breeders can agree that others can use the seed-free seeds freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"" "this does not mean that they can do not continue to business with their seed, and allow to cross it." "" "open source" "" "-breeders allow to cross the seed to breed so own varieties, and it is not immediate - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patrons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor Jack Kloppenburg, Professor Jack Kloppenburg, Professor Jack Kloppenburg have control over seed and the possibility to breed new plants as well as for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to seed, seed plays a role in greater corridors such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over nutrition and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"" "all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not." "" "who wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables as it is, for example, should also know how the nature is bred, like this vegetables is threatened." ""</seg>

<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies are at risk of food, as the available gene pool because of the ever numerous mental intellectual rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited, free of shrinkage.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, engaged in her graduation with genetically variation on carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all the cartoons are protected as intellectual property, which means it is usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there is still no estimates, but experts like Luby suspect that massacular plants such as wheat in more style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they have specifically desired characteristics - from such, through which their flavor or their color improves up to such, due to those who flourish in certain environments, such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders deceives more than ever before, because the modified conditions of climate change are much worse than ever.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto believes that genetic variability is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four Genbanques and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is responsible for the preservation of genetic variances.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property will promote other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant variations" "". "" "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibits innovations, but promotes the public more material and know-how to be provided." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: 20 years waiting until a patent is distracted, certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you wait so long for you to breed plants, which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, the struggle would have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "" "" "the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources should have been always a general, and it should continue to remain:" "" "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetical incentives are not attractive for us." ""</seg>

<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it's impossible to us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton disappears to patenting the concept of plant features:" "" "we are not creating the characteristics itself." ""</seg>

<seg id="2677">My concept is just wrong. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than for Monsanto) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies - either refuse it or maintain it too expensive and therefore not rewarding, or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, where the Egyptian authorities criticised this step for this step, and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>

<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first-censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2735">The blogs, blogs, is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be important for the world, it is for me for me.</seg>

<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">A couple of years he worked in a cohesitation. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of its low salary, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow sacks with mortars who were heavier than he himself, to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran impacted by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan Refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, which we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows, so that we cannot hear at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharf left his life without papers in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Asharf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church which shared twice a day of food.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is due to relatively high demand levels a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers are in the country, catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers" from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers is accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special Recording centers." "" "it is improvised by improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian Law, asylum seekers can only be shared if they officially have a request for asylum - what after registration of the asylum seekers can go for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either instructed to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there were also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his infamation of life helped Asharf, soon to free from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years of work in the construction industry, Asharf opened his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while and a Schnellimbite was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis Success Story is now topic of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The Venice City Award won the Venice City Award for the first time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for credits are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, around 20,000 Afghan people live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghan companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells us about the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the story of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan businessman Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs aims to extend far beyond Italian food industry and retail and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, are also possibilities," says Asharf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily, when I know that my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I have a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as all others. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharf is also plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which people can learn packaging and conservicing techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">Development to the successful entrepreneur was a journey through insecurity and doubts, but at the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharf has made this journey itself. now he wants to help other Afghan people on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2933">Users would have to be able to use the social networks within six months of succesful law of law on the website of the authority, indicating their full name and their ID.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of prison or penalty of penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixty members of parliamentarians, is currently under legislative as well as the Parliament's constitutional committee and shall be debated there.</seg>
