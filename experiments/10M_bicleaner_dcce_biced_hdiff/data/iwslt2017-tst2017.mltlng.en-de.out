that is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published the NSA &apos;s illegal phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter , which should leave a lasting impression .
it describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US secret surgery in which the CIA was literally handed over to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t really like the chapter ?
the U.S. Government .
for almost 10 years the government has been obtained against R@@ isen and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the government of government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy journalists .
according to the First Constitu@@ tional Court , media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ eller they cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government has arrived at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ters had before him , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He refused to go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen has thus lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , for years , it is essential for her case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in time electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources cannot hide .
instead of failure and R@@ isen to make any statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so , the investig@@ ators , without being informed , are concerned with his consent ,
just like its E @-@ Mail information , financial and bank information , its credit information , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and cra@@ p source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , justice was more condem@@ ning than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as secret .
since 11 September , almost every article about national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
so , we put the media work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitu@@ tion@@ ality , because the government has more possibilities to view all .
but just as the technology of the government allowed to avoid the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technology to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they may contact the moment in which they contact us , rather than in hind@@ sight .
today there is communication software that has not been written as R@@ isen , and it is much safer than ordinary e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet &apos;s most important thing , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload files or send documents , as with any ordinary contact form .
these will be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the respective message agency .
so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information I would like would not be available from advance .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately governments across the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that are all vulner@@ able to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about to ensure that not only technology ken@@ ner like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to have ini@@ qu@@ ities . it is as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to en@@ vy about the care of the supply of soldiers and wants to report about over@@ crowded hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the next environment worker , the alarm is to p@@ seu@@ do@@ ve water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warned us before the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expos@@ e crimes , but to protect our whole constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the greatest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have a statement . &#93; this week we asked news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s resident of the Mos@@ sack fund Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian Dic@@ t@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad post@@ age companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now there will be a lot of rich people outside and others who are waiting nervous for the next release and un@@ covered documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems wine we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty in the situation are to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few few , their assets to hide and to wear it -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and reveal it for ten years .
I think many people appears very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s difficult to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I feel like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe in front of it .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters .
I think it is interesting that there is fewer reports about this matter in the US .
probably because there has been no prominent Americans that occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no enough Americans that hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but through the principle , after which the tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to give less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the United States is allowed to strip school children &apos;s school children .
it is allowed to sc@@ rub@@ bed very sus@@ pen@@ sion@@ ary investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so , we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators acted as an African minister , who wanted to bring back money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we shocked it really that all up to a lawyer of our investig@@ ators did , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all pre@@ occupation . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was handed over to the money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as a single cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single lawyer , who under@@ went our cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not about a single top pol@@ lin@@ ker , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ as@@ ion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to overcome this , we have to change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very well as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing could ever be changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
in the past few years , we have seen Vor@@ ar@@ ge to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then the EU recorded in central stops at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress which we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama le@@ aks , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens would be used to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are mad when other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy , standing up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it to stop using the laws of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally stop this kind of tax ev@@ as@@ ion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story as I almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da would have landed .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sales .
a type in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked on my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in town and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep for tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows not the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got him first ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard my saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How please ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was in the bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken up ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild sleeping sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out from the bed to toe tips to the door , and my bedroom door lock .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he bought from me , is hang@@ ed in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my eye angle .
perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood than strangers were , actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
people at my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
we make a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ate draws off and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference at that time in the city . all hotels were booked out .
I think creativity can be able to transform fear into fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something like this . our apartment will stay in a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and a morning breakfast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air floor on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ et tast@@ ed completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest , and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came into rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ tered , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a web site , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms , whose doors are closed when visiting .
on the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the miss@@ ile would ign@@ ite .
but she did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business which allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children have learned them all , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , one feels good on things that you can see . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create with design imm@@ unity , between people who never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence with design ?
I &apos;d like to give you a sample , what degree of trust we needed .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone with your left seat .
this silent approach of panic that you can now feel -- -- exactly what you feel , if they open the first time .
because the only thing that is still personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al Go@@ res cell phone ?
could you tell us on Twitter that he en@@ codes for the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail to this experiment ?
what if your neighbor should have imag@@ ined with his name ; if he had told what he comes , like his dog or his children ?
imagine you would have 150 commis@@ sions that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel , if you had to leave your cell phone ?
for a well @-@ thought feedback system the trust strength@@ ens the trust .
at the beginning , we made some things wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult for people to leave negative ass@@ ess@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were given their courses , before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied , as probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are about age and residence .
little surprisingly we trust people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less trust we trust .
this is a natural social in@@ vert@@ eb@@ ral .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case through divisions .
if you have less than three divisions , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation st@@ out common@@ alities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you are priced .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you say too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; one gets no answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a lot , as for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; Great art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create with design to make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity . we also give tips how to write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with what we did not expect , the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
fir@@ stly : unbelie@@ v@@ ably good luck .
second : the in@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course there are times if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have been celebrated parties and apartments devast@@ ated .
hosts have to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood in front of the front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it &apos;s hurt when I only think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that sounds in the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us .
fortunately in the 123 million nights only a fra@@ ction ever had a problem .
for people trust each other .
when trust works , it can be wonder@@ ed .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even don@@ ates blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , who tend to tend to heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ections that save lives , although they don &apos;t know it right .
you enter a hospital in your own car , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
they can stay for a longer , without charge the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay is running .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with monetary @-@ trans@@ actions fit together ?
it is an economic trading here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s just called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hire industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not just right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of itself open , and that changes everything .
today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would be , if travels would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what would be , if at every location you visit a group there would wait to complete a group there , and show a thoroughly und@@ pent@@ ine quarter , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to shape apartments of the reason ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take part of the mutual agreement ?
I imagine cities that allow us to society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation .
in South Korea , this project has already begun . lots of places belonging to the government .
now local people were offered . students that were searching for a lead ,
they were medi@@ ated to people whose children were up , were started using incub@@ ators ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries are invited to host a stranger or even hosts .
the idea seems to be not so crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
there were also hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
aside from luck and timing , we realize that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us to overcome deep root pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think this is amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da passes me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great impact , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain under@@ wear , a terrorist group ?
or simply a delay at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media people represent , which look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great you meet you .
I say to you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker - double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ wer @-@ of @-@ gym fan@@ atic fans ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , for , Baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ gh@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you express yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist independence day , and compared to the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to fit me a perfect and un@@ eas@@ ible beauty ideal .
I did not only accept the faith of my parents .
I have the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , I thought , was dou@@ bt@@ ful and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion , deep@@ ened with any reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever feel that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all the Egyptians , my career as engineers .
later I had , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of them probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had an end and looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Breaking News . &quot;
as smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jum@@ ped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned to anger quickly .
why should we do that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; The Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only my country , but in N@@ u related me the deeds of others from a citizen in a susp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new town and begin with post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I was silent -- as we got silent -- so deeply it went to my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as mus@@ li@@ in .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw , and I read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ unded in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not lead you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week inside .
then Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims gather together for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again , the warning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque might be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feelings were under@@ stand@@ ably filtered and I heard also by attacks on Muslims or the people who were thinking for Muslims , dra@@ gged and beat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were really bran@@ dies on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who have attacked this country , have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have got the rage of people on terror@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to explain themselves constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the acc@@ us@@ ations which are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually listen to people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims and their mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only asks the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor are only under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , not tumor in the body of the US , but an important organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ ers and Olymp@@ ion@@ ics .
will the closing of mos@@ ques America make it safer ?
there might be a few parking spaces , but do not stop terror .
regular visiting of a mosque leads to regard people other faith toler@@ ant , and make bigger participation .
and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people actually won &apos;t be radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
at the radio process it has been noted that he begins online . as a first , the person from their church can be cut off , even by their family , that the person believes the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors her behaviour and their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or faith .
if we want to stop Radi@@ c@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establ@@ ishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a man , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination , if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you throw a look at them , she does not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality they can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they are facing the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem was precisely the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , she brought her wrath to her mind , her sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , she would only bring them into trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by nothing inspired and something that would have given sense to their rage , it was a main goal for instr@@ ument@@ alisation by extrem@@ ists which you promised a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this im@@ am placed the connection to God and her church again .
instead of blame for their anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept it before joining the IS .
it was a glimpse of how the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia lies me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it work on any other ?
how does the 24 hour use of fear of fear every day on our democracy ?
a study -- actually show several neuro@@ scientific studies -- when we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you have previously reported reviews about Muslims in which negative attacks were reported , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood for Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the ap@@ ron of Iraq and two elec@@ toral periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation to the public to compens@@ ate the foundation of a free society , which has sen@@ sible and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear ha@@ ves us all .
with the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet , most generous person , whom they knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was hop@@ ed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such a young man have become such a diversi@@ fied young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she killed , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon , as with a execution , after he posted out@@ ings against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we talked about it and for us it was no easy decision , because we would like to leave our children to our children : one thing that we would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely prac@@ tise our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we chose the mosque .
we were silent with our son at the pedi@@ gree , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes went out , and went into the building hall , and what I saw , let me hold .
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then the im@@ am made an announcement , than@@ kl@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered together were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , belie@@ ver and non @-@ belie@@ ver , who came not to attack us , but to teach us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion on panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join them , they mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a Ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what you say , that you might say that you &apos;re a T@@ ED@@ Talk to work a thought that are in a clas@@ sy factory , an exception , and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually am as it is allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you see on Muslims around the world , and I did so with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims across the world , people want normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to be prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , it is about to become a billion dollar store .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air p@@ act has entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting flights , flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the closest space .
you can also build self @-@ lev@@ able structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and to respond to natural laws .
today , we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible autonomous flight .
so a system autonomous works , it has to know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alis@@ ing technology by Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available on the highest level . e.g. , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail@@ starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other Star@@ r@@ hin@@ ders , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a cal@@ ist side .
a limitation of rear lights is that they respond sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the plane doesn &apos;t matter in which position can recover the optimal position and can be improved through practice .
okay .
during our research we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract issues that suggest the core of the thing .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts , which meet to bre@@ ach you .
decades ago , the pilots could fly remote controlled flying devices that had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
un@@ long , we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est remote plane . it was invented short .
it only has a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no g@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse areas , no further actu@@ ators or control areas , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens very much in the inside , so that it can fly stable and can move in space .
nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ or . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , if all looking right , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , a practice in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is not only symmet@@ ri@@ cally .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thereby he receives the extraordinary capability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is conc@@ ei@@ vable in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us see that .
if flying machines are supposed to be part of our everyday use , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft engines .
this turns in clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when they meet them , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller is falling off , electronics or a battery -- can fly further , if restricted .
we will demonstrate that by doing half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the great number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of es@@ thetic expression .
we used retail micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room she is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there is a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the salary in the development and process act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and con@@ j@@ ure our universe is , and that there are creative , smart heads allowed to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive , commercial and economic potential , is the t@@ ooth@@ ie on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very distant galax@@ ies , two black holes are becoming faster , they walked through the mass of three prob@@ es in a t@@ enth@@ s of pure energy in pure energy .
this short moment they lighten@@ ed bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the overall energy was put into space @-@ time encoder and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago , a majority life was created on Earth .
since then the Earth has resulted in a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand for us -- even the Internet .
approximately 25 years ago a group decided to build a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector , which are formed by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry Gra@@ vit@@ ational Training Ob@@ servatory .
in the following time , the precision of Lig@@ o increased considerably , which improved the recognition performance enorm@@ ously .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o now .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a recent test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the detector of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ amed the two col@@ li@@ ding of the two col@@ li@@ ding of black holes through the ground .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the part@@ ing of my father sick father .
basically , these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ists at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their ob@@ servatory as Lig@@ o meas@@ ur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a gathering in the structure of space and time .
by passing the shaft , space and overall content are stretched in one direction and in the other hand gest@@ ures .
to illustr@@ ate fac@@ ulty in courses for the relation theory often a real al@@ ber@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ culous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched out and stopped by us . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ stone radius of a nuclear sense . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vitation
described by Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os that hunt for the waves follows : &quot; the technical difficulties of building such det@@ ectors are massive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ c@@ ists are fin@@ anci@@ ally and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claimed to be more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite practical . because so you can produce a picture or map of things by taking the light of the coming light around you .
for sounds that is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much :
the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain properties like clay and pitch , rhythm and volume to close behind the story behind .
&quot; now Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t produce any simple images of objects in all with them .
but by making changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least the frequencies measured in the audi@@ ble area are at least .
so if we convert wave pattern into sound , we can literally hear All .
to listen to gravity , you can tell us much about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ pen with an additional sound change . that sounds so on : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o Fol@@ der : &#91; Sur@@ render of the noise &#93; J@@ one who knows what he must hear , recognize this as the noise of -- SH : two black holes , each with 30 times as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : let us think about what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in the All , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this force .
fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to investig@@ ate the universe as it was never before .
on this path we can listen to All the All and the In@@ visible .
much in All we can -- practically or basically -- not to see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ und@@ o stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about this .
the exciting physical processes occur however in the core that is hidden behind thousands of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see through , since this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are penet@@ rating iron , as if it would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the urine is covered by its own re@@ light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to back up to the beginning .
and that is most important : I am optimistic that we have never seen all things that we have never seen , and of whom we have never seen . things we can only hear by listening .
indeed , Lig@@ o found right in the first attempt of things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars that bring black holes , as Lig@@ o they observed , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o enables us a completely different view of the events in All , to the ones of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this may@@ hem .
AA : the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circles of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servatory -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of whom I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it felt nervous , made me feel anno@@ ying in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say .
I wanted to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be live on TV live ?
no , but yes !
would I want to start playing with watching ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do what I feared , removed my fear .
my fear , keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , that my life changed deeply , to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls out all the &quot; estim@@ ation , &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ lane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new way of life in my family . from there I s@@ wore to me always with them as soon as you can do to me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I don &apos;t make an effort .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently , I understood that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to play my career with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things , do you awake to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I &apos;m producing TV .
I &apos;m doing TV , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for about 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each show provides hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television sen@@ ders can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode of all nine days of television , four television programs , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which simultaneously in production are four episodes , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series will run on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 different languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I create , and not only produced so much . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans at camp fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires around the world .
do you know who else is doing ?
nobody , this is why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you all of you who work so hard , if you are now a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , so that I don &apos;t just talk about the computer , and it &apos;s true if I say : I understand that it does not dream about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything per@@ spiration -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ ens to work , there is no other feeling .
my work is always creating a country from nothing .
it is when I set troops out , I painted it on a canvas .
so as a high sound , one marathon draw a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting , de@@ ar@@ ming , clin@@ ically and mut@@ iny , cruel and sen@@ sible , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum@@ s .
there &apos;s such a change in me when the work runs well .
a sum@@ s start in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sound like a busy street , I could go for ever .
many people take them , if I explain the sum@@ s , that I speak , that writing is joy for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- as I started working with the TV production , when I began to work and work to work and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
sum@@ s is more than writing .
sum@@ s is action and activity . sum@@ s is a drug .
sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot stri@@ ve otherwise than to size .
the feeling is no different to stri@@ ve when looking for size , no matter what price .
that &apos;s called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it means ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask .
to make sure : the more ship@@ ments , the more scre@@ enings , the more over@@ laps , the more work there , the more work there , the more the more things , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , sum@@ s , sum@@ s , sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burnt out .
the sum@@ s stop .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estim@@ ation , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Land . &quot;
the children of a titanium are .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , no repent@@ ance , nothing to deleg@@ ate , does not sleep on , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me , silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and sum@@ s was I .
so , what do you do when doing what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l from , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do , you know what you do is to be a ban@@ ker to be a ban@@ ker , a ban@@ ker , a painter , if you know the sum@@ s , if you stop the sum@@ s , if the sum@@ s stop , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart list@@ ens , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ers &quot; question me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will say no , when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secon@@ dly , she called me not &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
they call no more &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
when did it happen ?
I pas@@ se it when I am titanium and my sum@@ s pray , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and let her sisters say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we laugh much and I &apos;m reading quite dramatic from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of sum@@ es , I cannot do anything , except to fit .
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
the country I created the marathon which I run , the army , the army , the screen , the high sound - they do no longer exist .
everything that exists are st@@ icky fingers and dam@@ p k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , juni@@ per p@@ enc@@ ils and song , in which it is going to let &apos;s go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and a burst of energy comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s remain with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the Titan@@ um , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you , if I am telling you , who I am , if I describe my brain , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what is the real sum@@ s .
sum@@ s is not strength and it is not working specifically .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river that comes from lust &apos;s lust .
true sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
true sum@@ s igno@@ res the printing of history , which experience to experience tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
when my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I make this a permanent rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good at playing , I don &apos;t like it .
you don &apos;t play ans@@ at@@ zwe@@ ise , as you work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work as I love it .
I rather am at work as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , for what a man rather works as to be a house ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am a relaxed guy , is none of them .
we jum@@ ped around in the garden , facing and back .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we bubbles the bubbles .
thereby I feel greater sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always attack@@ ing my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fulfil@@ s me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped with the playing ?
you can also say it ! they always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you are holding me for nai@@ v , for a day dream .
well , you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
they have time !
and you also know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show @-@ figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes with me they want to make something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaced me .
and speak my teen age for 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the Year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
each can take 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no lower@@ ing .
the day is short : dinner , the children finished praying .
but 15 minutes are available !
my children are my welfare , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what does good to you .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I victories . friends meet , read books that enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes at the end , why not allow for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it needs time , but after a few months , a door opens up the energy and I find myself into my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . I ow@@ e me to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
bubbles and st@@ icky fingers , supp@@ er with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful .
I am sorry that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in handle . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the more happy are I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I created the marathon which I run , the troops , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the right sum@@ s : sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , be@@ ating , naked , and new feeling of life in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m author , I think of things , I awake to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for less work and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neu@@ ros@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gen it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low skill for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgical procedure .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve function through various surgical measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; surely they have heard from one of the most famous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deep @-@ ir@@ n@@ stimulation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; we im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , which suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help yourself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a conduc@@ tive top@@ ical and worked day and night in the emergency .
I often supply patients with brain @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a controls the brain and increases the cran@@ ial pressure .
to save life , one has to reduce cran@@ ial pressure .
this requires sometimes a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by it ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow from a rif@@ le , comparable to very small children who will be taken out of your family .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to flour@@ ish .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François abol@@ ished .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a regular culture of culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from the biological class , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells which can transform into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we had another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they died .
so , we saw a new , strange cell population who looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand how they came .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
this blue and red cells called hot Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they remain us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
one thing , however , is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows cer@@ eb@@ ral healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells just cultiv@@ ate how it did Jean François
and then mark the color to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we plan@@ ed them on the kidn@@ apping point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- car transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we do not have such cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we do not have the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we plan@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken up after a few weeks , they would be taken back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and not plan@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells which were previously plan@@ ed .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells we are in vitro , in the culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so , we trained ap@@ es with a manual skill task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very well .
when they had reached a stable level of skill , we ver@@ ified the engine in the motor Cort@@ ex .
then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just like it would happen to people , they relaxing spont@@ ane@@ ously to some degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover in with the help of plastic bra@@ ins . they recover at some degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure the monkey reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkeys that recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we did not see the cells as plan@@ ed : the same monkey , two months after the char@@ m@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that we were very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about this cell .
we can freeze them and later use .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ press them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain has the means to cure himself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that there are now several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely go .
of course , the question of which the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . out@@ going from this great results you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : look into the future - you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to watch the future , how many years it take , until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it is a long time to choose the patients to execute and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply to a multic@@ entr@@ e study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that &apos;s sure , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake , as a course of course .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable emotion .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big offspring in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy makes democracy with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ signed Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally declared that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- does not influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my favorite friends who told me that democracy would change if anything would change anything .
at this point , I would like to present an economical model for a real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you , together with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group will have to believe us , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ sive and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for without democracy our societies are w@@ asted , our future , and our great , new technologies will be w@@ asted .
on the subject of waste I would like to point out to an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently threatened by our econom@@ ies .
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit par@@ adox . &quot;
one summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the Scho@@ en@@ berg , who casts its long shadows over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few recognize his dy@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to anxi@@ ous sa@@ vers and corpor@@ ations which could have been too anxi@@ ous to take it there where it might be productive and can also produce all the things that mankind is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tr@@ illion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States , in all the well @-@ producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office building , schools , streets , g@@ ou@@ ches , equipment and so on .
3,4 tr@@ illion U.S. dollars sounds like a lot of money , until they were around $ 5.1 tr@@ illion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock markets and the real estate prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital are the twin summit , not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , as it could not invest a low demand that could not invest a low demand that could kill him , that his son would kill him if he will grow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ inten@@ sely , the circumstances lead that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him .
that is my ha@@ v@@ eins with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely conc@@ e@@ der@@ ous art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to enhance our lives , develop human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form , in which the free and poor as a majority control the government .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy ended too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to reduce the value of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these out@@ lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave the working poor , and not only the right to free expression of expression , but important and crucial is the right to political participation with the same vote weigh@@ ting in questions of the nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle which lights very light , it is also quickly burned .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , the liberal democracy is based on Magna Cart@@ a &apos;s values , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for Herr@@ ing .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics , while the economy -- thus became the world of corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ cra@@ cies free zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable struggle between the two instead of which the economy gradually mig@@ rates to politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians do no longer be like earlier ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can now be in the government today and yet not in power because the power of politics is abol@@ ished in the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ v@@ eins with capitalism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of prey that is so sustainable the animals , of which they feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated , so that they star@@ ved in the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is similar to the economy that the politics rise so far from the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corpor@@ ations grows , policy of corpor@@ ations rising , the overall economic demand falls and the managers of the corpor@@ ations are anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of capitalism distri@@ butes the demo@@ s , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well@@ being of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control the control as in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left this idea already 100 years ago and it did not work very well .
teaching from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low glo@@ om workers through automation and robot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automation of the twin summit will be higher , the waste of w@@ asting and the social conflicts deeper as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to re@@ shape the economy and establish the fields of economy and politics again , and we make sure that we will be able to revi@@ ve the re@@ unified area of monitoring the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the question is not whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements that he will survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interesting question is whether capitalism is un@@ solved by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or similar to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in long discussions the sense of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like ut@@ opia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ opia ?
in practical implementation I want to give you some examples .
in the company &apos;s field : please introduce a capital market , where you are working , while you are working and in which your capital is working for you , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you just works -- is property of those who currently work in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all income from capital and rede@@ em and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no distinction between those who work the company , but not working in it , and employees that work there , but no do@@ cks between capital and work , no big g@@ aps between investment and spar@@ ar , and ultimately no emp@@ tive t@@ wins summit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of global political economy , please introduce that our national currencies would have a vac@@ ant exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging econom@@ ists &#93; , in the interests of the entire human race . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and every government pays the sum , which corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that there was no technical means at that time .
today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world I describe you is more liberal , and mar@@ x@@ ically , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we politically opt for .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ ice ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liberal Marx@@ ists .
what is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do this , technological development will create a massive decline of overall economic demand that Larry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the transmission of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next , as we have to experience it , it will not only be our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant .
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and so I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t think , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it &apos;s a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday with dinner of the speakers you have told you what you think of the perspective of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy on politics , during the area where most of the game plays , -- the field of economy -- a completely demo@@ cr@@ ative zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a certain way , when I can say the pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , histor@@ ically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was especially scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what you can now watch in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now acc@@ uses to do what is done in the West in the 19th century , sm@@ ells enormous after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suppose that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very disappo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to start with the euro@@ zone .
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and den@@ ying that a massive reduction line proce@@ eded by the Eurozone , and continues to be massive threatened by the development of the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was revealed to den@@ ying this den@@ ial -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
right . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , will continue to den@@ ying the den@@ ial .
but you know what is coming .
that is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not able to gain life through political will and author@@ itarian for life , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destruc@@ tive .
BG : what changes are you ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he claimed that he did not make mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to submit the application for the end of February to the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of money , to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the levels they run through the Eurozone .
they did not admit that they led a disast@@ rous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one out of the Troika of Money which imposed us this policy , stopped : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ lov@@ ingly mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone opposite comes from somebody , who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone did not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if it does not survive , they will be demon@@ ically demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be alone for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we stum@@ bled the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , it will appear as well as for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong with this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for many of you .
that goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ yel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Feature , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for the shows and content to produce the content of Amazon .
of course this is a very hard fighting industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he needs to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are located on this bend .
this curve is the evaluation of over 2,500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating is showing 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows do this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Breaking Bath , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where you looked at a season , your brain is asking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- you should tell you what is going on at the end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the curve because I think you don &apos;t need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on the middle winding , the average television -- the shows which are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t love .
so , he must ensure that he is really at the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something so that &apos;s why Roy Price wants to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , and then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and place them online where they can watch any charge .
and if Amazon returns in vain things , you can get right ?
millions of viewers look at this episodes .
however , they do not know that they are watched by watching these shows .
you will be watched by Roy and his team .
they capture when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts you ski@@ ps and look at once again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show them should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process and this will result in response , and these reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four rep@@ ubli@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha House , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems that not many remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- thus something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has pl@@ az@@ iert . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always looking for this a super show , but he also uses data for it but it makes it different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team che@@ wed on the existing data about Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows them etc .
then use these data to find out these little details about the viewer : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 assessment on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what is happening here ?
it has two very competent , data versi@@ fied firms .
they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic had somehow thought that this should work with everything .
if one collec@@ ts millions of data , one can make a decision , one should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computer .
the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good television , right ?
if data analysis did not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary , because we live in a time we find more and more about statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond the television .
someone knows someone here the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health System is a software company and I hope that no one comes in contact with this software ever in contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if anyone is in prison here and for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ mis@@ sal is or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad , it will decide whether a person is good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there are evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are created . it &apos;s not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data is also er@@ ased , and are wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that they can predi@@ ct the flu out@@ breaks of flu , aw@@ ful way -- by data analysis of Google resear@@ ches .
it worked wonderfully and was a huge news station . success was the success of a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it did not work , it was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data have experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows into consideration of life -- at work , at work , in medicine .
so , we should make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genet@@ ics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some pattern about the difference between successful decisions on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , remove this problem into its individual parts , so that you can analyse the components ; as a second , you put the components together again to gras@@ p a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and assemble again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have data and mind , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to understand their audience better , what else they would not have been capable of . but the decision to res@@ ume all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which did not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this show for this show , which meant that they went on a very personal risk of this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compete about TV ideas , then they selected &quot; alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this device is quite useful .
thank you ...
before there were data , this was the tool for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s amazing . you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will make it a real time later with a technology demo .
I have met some decisions in my life so far , I should have heard in the ball on the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much rash such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic body .
so maybe the ball is kl@@ ed and cl@@ adding . ultimately it &apos;s up to meet decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as very encour@@ aging news , that despite the great amount of data , it is still paying off decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and risks .
because at the end it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you land at the end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
