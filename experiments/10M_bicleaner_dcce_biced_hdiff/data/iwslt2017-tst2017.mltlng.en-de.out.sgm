<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published the NSA's illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter, which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">It describes a catastrophic US secret surgery in which the CIA was literally handed over to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't really like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been obtained against Risen and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the government of government, whistleblowers and to spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mueller they cost.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "so when the government has arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had before him, saying," "" "He refused to go to prison." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen has thus lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, for years, it is essential for her case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time electronic monitoring the reporters and sources cannot hide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and Risen to make any statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigators, without being informed, are concerned with his consent,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its E-Mail information, financial and bank information, its credit information, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and crap source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead, justice was more condemning than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 11 September, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the media work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutionality, because the government has more possibilities to view all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government allowed to avoid the rights of reporters, the press can also use technology to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they may contact the moment in which they contact us, rather than in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not been written as Risen, and it is much safer than ordinary e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet's most important thing, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload files or send documents, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the respective message agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information I would like would not be available from advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately governments across the world develop new spying technologies that are all vulnerable to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">It is about to ensure that not only technology kenner like Edward Snowden have a way to have iniquities. it is as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "who wants to envy about the care of the supply of soldiers and wants to report about overcrowded hospitals." "" "or the next environment worker, the alarm is to pseudove water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warned us before the next financial crisis." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our whole constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the greatest data leck of history was published.] [what does it mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness.] [what does it mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have a statement.] this week we asked news about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama's resident of the Mossack fund Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say," "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian Dictator Bashar al-Assad postage companies in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children days, a famous cellist." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "now there will be a lot of rich people outside and others who are waiting nervous for the next release and uncovered documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems wine weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty in the situation are to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by a few few, their assets to hide and to wear it -- something that we have been discussing and reveal it for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears very confusing this whole world, and it's difficult to understand how this tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I feel like a Matrjoschkapuppe in front of it.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there is fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there has been no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no enough Americans that hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which the tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to give less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the United States is allowed to strip school children's school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is allowed to scrubbed very suspensionary investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So, we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators acted as an African minister, who wanted to bring back money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we shocked it really that all up to a lawyer of our investigators did, how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preoccupation. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was handed over to the money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it's not about a single lawyer, who underwent our covert investigators." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top pollinker, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we have to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very well as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing could ever be changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen Vorarge to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then the EU recorded in central stops at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress which we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama leaks, this huge insight into the world of tax havens would be used to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are mad when other people can hide their true identity behind headcompanies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy, standing up and say," "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it to stop using the laws of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally stop this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazda would have landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sales.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda stopped and looked on my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in town and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep for tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows not the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got him first! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard my saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "How please?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was in the bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought:" "" "Oh man! what have I broken up?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleeping sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out from the bed to toe tips to the door, and my bedroom door lock.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he bought from me, is hanged in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my eye angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood than strangers were, actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People at my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate draws off and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference at that time in the city. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can be able to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"" "I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" "" "Brian, I think about how we could earn something like this. our apartment will stay in a designer bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and a morning breakfast." ""</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air floor on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham Omelet tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest, and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blechartered, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a web site, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms, whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business which allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children have learned them all, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, one feels good on things that you can see. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create with design immunity, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I'd like to give you a sample, what degree of trust we needed.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to lock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone with your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent approach of panic that you can now feel -- -- exactly what you feel, if they open the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is still personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he encodes for the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail to this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor should have imagined with his name; if he had told what he comes, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 commissions that all say: "he can really hold very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel, if you had to leave your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-thought feedback system the trust strengthens the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">"" "" "" "it was difficult for people to leave negative assessments." ""</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were given their courses, before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied, as probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are about age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social invertebral.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case through divisions.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three divisions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stout commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you are priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you say too little, like "Hi!," one gets no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "a lot, as for example," "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is rather not accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great art works in your apartment! I'm doing with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity. we also give tips how to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we did not expect, the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the intireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been celebrated parties and apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood in front of the front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it's hurt when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that sounds in the voice of the callers, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately in the 123 million nights only a fraction ever had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it can be wondered.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donates blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who tend to tend to heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protections that save lives, although they don't know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You enter a hospital in your own car, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay for a longer, without charge the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with monetary-transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trading here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it's just called" "" "hire industry" "", "the thing is not just right." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of itself open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">Today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, if travels would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if at every location you visit a group there would wait to complete a group there, and show a thoroughly undpentine quarter, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments of the reason?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take part of the mutual agreement?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us to society and relations, instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea, this project has already begun. lots of places belonging to the government.</seg>
<seg id="240">Now local people were offered. students that were searching for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">They were mediated to people whose children were up, were started using incubators,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries are invited to host a stranger or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not so crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There were also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Aside from luck and timing, we realize that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think this is amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda passes me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great impact, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain underwear, a terrorist group?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great you meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker - double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sewer-of-gym fanatic fans,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, for, Baby, I was not born so.</seg>

<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to oughten me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to carry the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you express yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist independence day, and compared to the pressure that I felt as a 17-year-old to fit me a perfect and uneasible beauty ideal.</seg>

<seg id="280">I have the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, I thought, was doubtful and believed in the end.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion, deepened with any reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever feel that someone you perceive, you fully understand, and somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the Egyptians, my career as engineers.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later I had, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of them probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had an end and looked at the screen and saw the word "Breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">As smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned to anger quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="299">""... "I changed the television channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists" ""... "..." ""... "in the name of Islam..." ""... "The Jihad..." ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"" "" "" "it is not only my country, but in Nu related me the deeds of others from a citizen in a suspect." ""</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new town and begin with postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I was silent -- as we got silent -- so deeply it went to my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as musliin.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I saw, and I read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations said:" "" "be careful," "" "sounded in well lit areas," "" "Do not lead you." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="319">These are the accusations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "today we can actually listen to people," "" "there is a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to close Muslims and their mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only asks the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour as a whole and a benign tumor are only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, not tumor in the body of the US, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelers and Olympionics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques America make it safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be a few parking spaces, but do not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visiting of a mosque leads to regard people other faith tolerant, and make bigger participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people actually won't be radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the radio process it has been noted that he begins online. as a first, the person from their church can be cut off, even by their family, that the person believes the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors her behaviour and their ideology, is a traitor or faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to stop Radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a man, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination, if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you throw a look at them, she does not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they are facing the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"" "he said," "" "the problem was precisely the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke, she brought her wrath to her mind, her sense of unrighteousness in the world, she would only bring them into trouble." ""</seg>
<seg id="350">"" "" "" "by nothing inspired and something that would have given sense to their rage, it was a main goal for instrumentalisation by extremists which you promised a solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam placed the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of blame for their anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept it before joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was a glimpse of how the Islamophobia lies me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour use of fear of fear every day on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually show several neuroscientific studies -- when we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you have previously reported reviews about Muslims in which negative attacks were reported, they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood for Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of Iraq and two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool for manipulation to the public to compensate the foundation of a free society, which has sensible and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear haves us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the assignment of collective innocence, it is not only about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweet, most generous person, whom they knew.</seg>

<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she killed, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon, as with a execution, after he posted outings against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"" "" "" "we talked about it and for us it was no easy decision, because we would like to leave our children to our children: one thing that we would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion." ""</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We were silent with our son at the pedigree, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out, and went into the building hall, and what I saw, let me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"" "then the imam made an announcement, thankled and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered together were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believer and non-believer, who came not to attack us, but to teach us." ""</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment, I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion on panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists, it is about to become a billion dollar store.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air pact has entered into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flights, flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the closest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-levable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and to respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So a system autonomous works, it has to know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localising technology by Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on the highest level. e.g., "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tailstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrhinders, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a calist side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear lights is that they respond sensitive to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the plane doesn't matter in which position can recover the optimal position and can be improved through practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract issues that suggest the core of the thing.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts, which meet to breach you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, the pilots could fly remote controlled flying devices that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong, we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote plane. it was invented short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No gaps, hinges and transverse areas, no further actuators or control areas, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens very much in the inside, so that it can fly stable and can move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailor. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood, if all looking right, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospinner is a exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the omnihead with its eight propellers, a practice in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not only symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the extraordinary capability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines are supposed to be part of our everyday use, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When they meet them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a motor or propeller is falling off, electronics or a battery -- can fly further, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by doing half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The great number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of esthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We used retail micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room she is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there is a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the salary in the development and process act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and conjure our universe is, and that there are creative, smart heads allowed to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive, commercial and economic potential, is the toothie on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxies, two black holes are becoming faster, they walked through the mass of three probes in a tenths of pure energy in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lightened brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The overall energy was put into space-time encoder and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a majority life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has resulted in a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God stand for us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Approximately 25 years ago a group decided to build a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector, which are formed by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Training Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of Ligo increased considerably, which improved the recognition performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a recent test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the detector of the detector, the gravitational waves roamed the two colliding of the two colliding of black holes through the ground.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting of my father sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists at MIT. he studied gravitational waves from black holes and their observatory as Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a gathering in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">By passing the shaft, space and overall content are stretched in one direction and in the other hand gestures.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate faculty in courses for the relation theory often a real alberly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched out and stopped by us. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandstone radius of a nuclear sense. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described by Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs that hunt for the waves follows: "the technical difficulties of building such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are financially and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claimed to be more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can produce a picture or map of things by taking the light of the coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">For sounds that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like clay and pitch, rhythm and volume to close behind the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't produce any simple images of objects in all with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by making changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least the frequencies measured in the audible area are at least.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern into sound, we can literally hear All.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to gravity, you can tell us much about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same cirpen with an additional sound change. that sounds so on: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date, which at least I never forget -- heard Ligo Folder: [Surrender of the noise] Jone who knows what he must hear, recognize this as the noise of -- SH: two black holes, each with 30 times as fast as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in the All, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 sones, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this force.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to investigate the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to All the All and the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in All we can -- practically or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why mundo stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about this.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur however in the core that is hidden behind thousands of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, since this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves are penetrating iron, as if it would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the urine is covered by its own relight.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to back up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that is most important: I am optimistic that we have never seen all things that we have never seen, and of whom we have never seen. things we can only hear by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">Indeed, Ligo found right in the first attempt of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: ME: the kind of stars that bring black holes, as Ligo they observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo enables us a completely different view of the events in All, to the ones of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this mayhem.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circles of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a brand new generation of Observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of whom I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it felt nervous, made me feel annoying in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes" to say.</seg>
<seg id="557">I wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I want to start playing with watching?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do what I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, keep talking, my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, that my life changed deeply, to an unexpectedly kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls out all the "estimation,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "estimation, I need milk for my beak-lane." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new way of life in my family. from there I swore to me always with them as soon as you can do to me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I don't make an effort.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has a startling side effect: only recently, I understood that" "" "Yes" "" "came to play my career with my children." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think of things, do you awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I'm producing TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for about 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show provides hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television senders can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode of all nine days of television, four television programs, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which simultaneously in production are four episodes, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series will run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 different languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I create, and not only produced so much. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans at camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, this is why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who work so hard, if you are now a company, a country or a classrooms, so that I don't just talk about the computer, and it's true if I say: I understand that it does not dream about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepens to work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always creating a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set troops out, I painted it on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as a high sound, one marathon draw a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting, dearming, clinically and mutiny, cruel and sensible, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There's such a change in me when the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums start in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sound like a busy street, I could go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take them, if I explain the sums, that I speak, that writing is joy for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- as I started working with the TV production, when I began to work and work to work and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">Sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Sums is action and activity. sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot strive otherwise than to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling is no different to strive when looking for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">That's called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it means ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make sure: the more shipments, the more screenings, the more overlaps, the more work there, the more work there, the more the more things, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, sums, sums, sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stop.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimation, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">The children of a titanium are.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titanen work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, no repentance, nothing to delegate, does not sleep on, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me, silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, what do you do when doing what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think:" "" "Heul from, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, you know what you do is to be a banker to be a banker, a banker, a painter, if you know the sums, if you stop the sums, if the sums stop, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart listens, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States waiters" question me.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way outside, late and she says," "" "Mama, you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did it happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I passe it when I am titanium and my sums pray, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and let her sisters say," "" "we laugh much and I'm reading quite dramatic from the book" "" "Everybody Poops." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of sumes, I cannot do anything, except to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created the marathon which I run, the army, the army, the screen, the high sound - they do no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and damp kisses, delicate voices, juniper pencils and song, in which it is going to let's go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and a burst of energy comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's remain with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the workmen, the Titanum, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you, if I am telling you, who I am, if I describe my brain, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what is the real sums.</seg>
<seg id="707">Sums is not strength and it is not working specifically.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river that comes from lust's lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">True sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True sums ignores the printing of history, which experience to experience tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"" "the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">When my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a permanent rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good at playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">You don't play ansatzweise, as you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work as I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at work as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, for what a man rather works as to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am a relaxed guy, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We jumped around in the garden, facing and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We bubbles the bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Thereby I feel greater stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always attacking my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped with the playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! they always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you are holding me for naiv, for a day dream.</seg>
<seg id="742">Well, you're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">They have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you also know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show-figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes with me they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teen age for 15 minutes with me, I am Mother of the Year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can take 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no lowering.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children finished praying.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are available!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare, my world. it must not be the children. it is true to feel sums to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what does good to you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>

<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes at the end, why not allow for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It needs time, but after a few months, a door opens up the energy and I find myself into my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. I owe me to new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky fingers, supper with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and for that I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">I am sorry that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in handle. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happy are I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I created the marathon which I run, the troops, the screens, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sums: sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, beating, naked, and new feeling of life in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm author, I think of things, I awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "for less work and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neuroschirurgen it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low skill for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve function through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"" "surely they have heard from one of the most famous," "" "Deep-irnstimulation" "". "we implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves." ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help yourself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a conductive topical and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supply patients with brain-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that brain-brain traumata controls the brain and increases the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one has to reduce cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">This requires sometimes a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by it?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow from a rifle, comparable to very small children who will be taken out of your family.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François abolished.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a regular culture of culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biological class, that stem cells are unripe cells which can transform into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We had another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So, we saw a new, strange cell population who looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">This blue and red cells called hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows cerebral healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then the cells just cultivate how it did Jean François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark the color to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planed them on the kidnapping point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- car transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we do not have such cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we do not have the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we planed the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken up after a few weeks, they would be taken back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and not planed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells which were previously planed.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells we are in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So, we trained apes with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable level of skill, we verified the engine in the motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just like it would happen to people, they relaxing spontaneously to some degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover in with the help of plastic brains. they recover at some degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkeys that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we did not see the cells as planed: the same monkey, two months after the charmplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about this cell.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to impress them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain has the means to cure himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I'm sure that there are now several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely go.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of which the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. outgoing from this great results you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future - you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to watch the future, how many years it take, until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It is a long time to choose the patients to execute and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that's sure, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake, as a course of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant that is in reality but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable emotion.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big offspring in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy makes democracy with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I resigned Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally declared that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- does not influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my favorite friends who told me that democracy would change if anything would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present an economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask you, together with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup will have to believe us, we could save democracy, but that we need a trusive and defensive democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are wasted, our future, and our great, new technologies will be wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the Schoenberg, who casts its long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"" "" "" "a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to anxious savers and corporations which could have been too anxious to take it there where it might be productive and can also produce all the things that mankind is urgently needed, for example" "" "green" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States, in all the well-producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office building, schools, streets, gouches, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3,4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds like a lot of money, until they were around $5.1 trillion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock markets and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">"" "" "" "thus, debts and unproductive capital are the twin summit, not compensated by the usual market mechanisms." ""</seg>
<seg id="924">"" "" "" "the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, as it could not invest a low demand that could not invest a low demand that could kill him, that his son would kill him if he will grow." ""</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintensely, the circumstances lead that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my haveins with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "his extremely concederous art. all the unproductive capital should be used to enhance our lives, develop human talents, and especially to finance the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are decisive for salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form, in which the free and poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to reduce the value of the athenical democracy due to these outlines.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decision on the athenian democracy was and is that she gave the working poor, and not only the right to free expression of expression, but important and crucial is the right to political participation with the same vote weighting in questions of the nationality." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle which lights very light, it is also quickly burned.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies don't have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, the liberal democracy is based on Magna Carta's values, which ultimately was a statute for Herring.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process was bordered on politics, while the economy -- thus became the world of corporations -- a democracies free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our present democracies, since the time this separation of politics and economy began, an inexorable struggle between the two instead of which the economy gradually migrates to politics." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians do no longer be like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because you can now be in the government today and yet not in power because the power of politics is abolished in the economy and the areas are separated." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haveins with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"" "" "" "if you think about it, it is like a herd of prey that is so sustainable the animals, of which they feeds, decimated, so that they starved in the end." ""</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "it is similar to the economy that the politics rise so far from the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, policy of corporations rising, the overall economic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are anxious to invest the cash of their company." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "" "" "the more successful" "" "demos" "" "of capitalism distributes the demos, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wellbeing of mankind." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "control the control as in ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left this idea already 100 years ago and it did not work very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">Teaching from the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low gloom workers through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"" "" "" "the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas," "" "the automation of the twin summit will be higher, the waste of wasting and the social conflicts deeper as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come." ""</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "so we have to reshape the economy and establish the fields of economy and politics again, and we make sure that we will be able to revive the reunified area of monitoring the" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentary film" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">Therefore, the question is not whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements that he will survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">"" "the interesting question is whether capitalism is unsolved by a dystopia, similar to the" "" "matrix" "", "or similar to the" "" "Star Trek" "", "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" "" "Agora" "", "in long discussions the sense of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" like utopia rather than the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I want to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company's field: please introduce a capital market, where you are working, while you are working and in which your capital is working for you, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you just works -- is property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then all income from capital and redeem and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">There is no distinction between those who work the company, but not working in it, and employees that work there, but no docks between capital and work, no big gaps between investment and sparar, and ultimately no emptive twins summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">"" "" "" "in the field of global political economy, please introduce that our national currencies would have a vacant exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging economists], in the interests of the entire human race." ""</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "the cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "cosmos" "" "and every government pays the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that there was no technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">"" "" "" "the world I describe you is more liberal, and marxically, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian." ""</seg>
<seg id="973">But in all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "Matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we politically opt for.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanice...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">What is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we do this, technological development will create a massive decline of overall economic demand that Larry Summers is called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "through the transmission of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next, as we have to experience it, it will not only be our democracies, but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and so I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't think, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it's a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday with dinner of the speakers you have told you what you think of the perspective of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"" "" "" "as I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy on politics, during the area where most of the game plays, -- the field of economy -- a completely democrative zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, when I can say the provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can now watch in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now accuses to do what is done in the West in the 19th century, smells enormous after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suppose that this is coming.</seg>

<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>

<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Iyelfrisur and describes on Twitter as" "" "Feature, TV, Technology, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for the shows and content to produce the content of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He needs to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are located on this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2,500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating is showing 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows do this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "they are shows like" "" "Breaking Bath," "" "Game of Thrones" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "where you looked at a season, your brain is asking:" "" "where is there more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows as" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- you should tell you what is going on at the end of the curve. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the curve because I think you don't need special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on the middle winding, the average television -- the shows which are neither good nor bad, they just don't love.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So, he must ensure that he is really at the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something so that's why Roy Price wants to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, and then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and place them online where they can watch any charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon returns in vain things, you can get right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watched by watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watched by Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They capture when you start the show when you paused, which parts you skips and look at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show them should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process and this will result in response, and these reads:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "alpha House," "" "but it seems that not many remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- thus something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has plaziert. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. exactly like Roy is always looking for this a super show, but he also uses data for it but it makes it different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team chewed on the existing data about Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows them etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find out these little details about the viewer: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went a car and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 assessment on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competent, data versified firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic had somehow thought that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, one can make a decision, one should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste, what you can expect is good television, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis did not work, then this is a bit scary, because we live in a time we find more and more about statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Someone knows someone here the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health System is a software company and I hope that no one comes in contact with this software ever in contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone is in prison here and for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad, it will decide whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there are evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. it's not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data is also erased, and are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that they can predict the flu outbreaks of flu, awful way -- by data analysis of Google researches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a huge news station. success was the success of a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It did not work, it was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data have experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows into consideration of life -- at work, at work, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">"" "" "" "or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some pattern about the difference between successful decisions on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread." ""</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, remove this problem into its individual parts, so that you can analyse the components; as a second, you put the components together again to grasp a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and assemble again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have data and mind, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience better, what else they would not have been capable of. but the decision to resume all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this show for this show, which meant that they went on a very personal risk of this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they compete about TV ideas, then they selected "alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they say the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thank you...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there were data, this was the tool for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball." "" "it's amazing. you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will make it a real time later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life so far, I should have heard in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much rash such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic body.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is kled and cladding. ultimately it's up to meet decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news, that despite the great amount of data, it is still paying off decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you land at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
