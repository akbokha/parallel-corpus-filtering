Munich 1856 : four maps that change your view over the city
an Irish An@@ st@@ alt , where to meet young people today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers act the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when land cards are not currently available .
everyone knows that , who had to make an exciting way , because the car Nav@@ i was taking place a green lawn .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern the State Government , are anything but current - but just very conclu@@ sive .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
it is clear , as far as cities and communities across the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a fli@@ cker which you don &apos;t know as such .
in the large @-@ picture postcard , documents and municip@@ alities have been selected for more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine leaves .
this was created according to the Bavarian Con@@ centr@@ ation Council between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and issued a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes .
finally , when French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9th , 1801 , the present neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern Map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project further forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian renewal management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ positi@@ onal sheet for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ send@@ ling , which is relatively isolated in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .
S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the creation of the map , thus 1877 , the district of Munich .
today Unter@@ send@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated in 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; wherever the West park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : there is a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax is derived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , small plots have no more farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Lower send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 at the Okto@@ ber@@ f@@ ests , was actually a me@@ adow , and not a concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ur@@ positi@@ onal sheet you read not only the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the guest dough &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or by the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the ventilation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße you once locked people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 of the Munich &apos;s district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; At the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the facility - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended up the purchase of the so called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he was prohibited to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who employs an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
first place for 280 patients was extended and extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the county seat in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry since 2006 .
in the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people now encounter Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex in 1920 and turned him to a hostel with vocational training courses .
West is located west of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of Residence from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; has been erected in architectural style on the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt who was destroyed during World War II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ er@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Mün@@ ch .
the bom@@ bers of the Al@@ lies broke down many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ en@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once taken at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days will work and take place on April 5 , 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group published travel warning for Mis@@ souri
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the promotion of colour is issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ souri by discrimin@@ ative politics and the rac@@ ist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Mis@@ souri , who want to take into force on 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial , ra@@ cial events in the whole country and here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the statement of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent Act of Mis@@ souri , which makes people difficult to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ uting authorities of the state , causing un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to min@@ orities , promp@@ ted the group to publish the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have infr@@ in@@ gements of civil rights that happen people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped due to their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such an incidence that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist agreements against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died in the beginning of the year , after he had no more petrol during the journey through the state , and was taken over by the police of Mis@@ souri , without being accused of a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also indicates a recent report of the Office of the Council of Mis@@ souri in which black drivers will be more common in the state 75 percent more common than the wh@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees know what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring a claim , or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Mis@@ souri recorded 100 pounds , according to the latest numbers from the H@@ ass@@ ver@@ bre@@ ach @-@ report of the FBI , which occurred the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for residential or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued a travel warning for Texas and Arizona , after the states that immig@@ ration laws had agreed to ban people because of immig@@ ration laws , which will contribute to the view of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but in recent years , stak@@ eholders have used the measure to specific laws and trends within the US .
Wei@@ dec@@ ay Project is Ele@@ mentary
the F@@ ish@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and is continued next year .
the CDU Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ s@@ led Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have a painting a picture .
the leader of the fish@@ bach family of Schwen@@ demann met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann initially granted insights into his farm , where he supplies 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest farms , 40 dairy cows and as many young were cared for and in five apartments in a holiday homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the most alternative mark@@ er for the milk of his cows , as swi@@ ft@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ h@@ room exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of F@@ ish@@ bach , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elem@@ ental project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can do not thread on such surfaces .
the green area care for much work , much work with the sense sense can be mach@@ ined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; emphas@@ ized Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ ies and carried out the crops without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead bio@@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the shadow project and is glad about the leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers had to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare .
you hope that the pro@@ o@@ rest@@ ation of the surfaces could still be moved out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their farm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were enclosed in 2013 .
the disclos@@ ure surface amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be stopped until at least 20@@ 23 .
the half over leader was funded by the total cost of 71 500 euros , a quarter established by the village of Fis@@ bach .
thus the farmers stay 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t have a really good job , without farmers and coun@@ sels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also for Peter White : &quot; best foods are produced . &quot;
the landscape @-@ care line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables to promote the state subsi@@ dies of women .
the goal is the Dis@@ closure of the Black Forest .
the presence of a funding recorded by the L@@ PR is required .
in addition , the enclosed area must not be dra@@ ined ( slope above 35 percent ) and must thus be threatened by the pro@@ vocation .
at the moment , the application of eight participants with 24 c@@ els , who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence at the moment .
the open area is 35 hectares , the calculated cost of more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump joins the Statue of Liberty now
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they start attack@@ ing statues .
the Americans now appreciate those like any other - hence the sor@@ ship staged Saddam Hussein &apos;s space at Fir@@ dos in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic fight with Jim A@@ cost@@ a from CNN &apos;s proposals on dra@@ stic restri@@ ction of the legal immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of immigrants and Liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have mixed it if he had done it .
but it took their meaning , and especially the importance of it was written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument was added to his base .
when Miller A@@ cost@@ a compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem you refer to which later was added and not part of the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is absolutely correct , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemp@@ or@@ ating words of Lazarus , the only one , in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your mos@@ quit@@ oes , your poor , / your afflicted masses , who longed for , free to breathe freely , / the waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh tr@@ ash &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends , who used to place their words after her death on the base - knew very well that they had a high political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the links between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by portra@@ yed the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classical illustration .
Lazarus changed the meaning : in their poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a completely different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change this from right wing this long .
the big scre@@ wing as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty refused to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch shall not shine the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh shot here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of stand@@ point of perception .
the great mag@@ nific@@ ant indeed of Lazarus consisted in it to see as it was seen by the exhau@@ st@@ ive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys to the deck of ships .
it is in the true sense of seeing the world from a perspective of people who seek shelter and have a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wanted to ackno@@ wledge .
their tor@@ ch shall not light up the way , but hat@@ red , which is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black comm@@ ends Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds himself of a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent quot@@ a is a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops , &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom needs to learn something out of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue to continue until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the guy at the road corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ fli@@ ps - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m circuit while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected for the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
their capit@@ als was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or where they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought quite naturally , were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Common@@ wealth sil@@ med@@ alists who will compete with their fifth world championships for the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unbelievable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots are in the British team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle stretch of Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records in the past year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another shooting down after a great season , which included the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the 30th Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle reminds himself of their first world championships , when the only other shooting in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team @-@ capit@@ als says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men are not only a team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing to be team @-@ capit@@ als is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , but we know that my te@@ amm@@ ate has voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ unds .
what are my words concerned as captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home World Championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympic Stadium .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it will be just as a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block criticism from Facebook : do not throw up a public office if you can &apos;t waste heat from voters
the father of our country knew something from worse media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him because of his political principles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he cho@@ osen on the cr@@ iti@@ que , sure .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refra@@ ction can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and dum@@ b we will lead as sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Governor Larry H@@ ogan expected to work on how Washington needs to work .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union conclu@@ des it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the staff of the Govern@@ ors dismissed the complaint as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online commentary was full of a counter action with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it &apos;s a guy like H@@ ogan expected .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
it has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to join with his voters and playing his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons that come to the Governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which will be officially designated as a public and of employees who will be paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans Spe@@ aker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of trol@@ ls or chambers or water @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ ogan .
and they are just genuine people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no trol@@ ls .
they all said that their comments was resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not profound .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD , was not water @-@ filled , but she asked to break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take on the same subject , they are rather dis@@ counted as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a big group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the staff of the govern@@ ors described as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably name other &quot; Für@@ y . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or delete a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors and to burn and bring to prot@@ esters and to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this just happens digitally .
H@@ ogan is not the first public officials that critic@@ ises that he has implic@@ ated Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , as they appointed a voters from their fac@@ ebook site .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect to the Internet .
the number of newspapers , between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter of letters were killed on his lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous trol@@ ls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers and Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pet@@ itions , who has critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trading , and shipping with the UK , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put it into silence .
refra@@ c@@ tive , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means that to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
former European Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led in the past year alongside the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to En@@ dr@@ unde , before joining Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new venue and serves as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches its fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; the players will see this course from his top side , it is in a great condition .
Jerry has made a great job when he made this place .
he is a fri@@ ght@@ ful advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player home to South@@ port .
&quot; I haven &apos;t been able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was in the year after I had won them from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European senior tour this year after his 50th birthday , returns to the action on home ground .

&quot; it always means a little more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .

less lung cancer through passive smoking
in the past two decades , less people have died due to passive smoking on lung cancer .
scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) came to this result in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 credit cr@@ abs per year are due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved to this topic from 1994 .
at that time , there have been more than 400 pul@@ lung cancer due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
household connections are considered very complex
construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; are reas@@ on@@ ably priced at the time , &quot; the leader of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground a lot of scattered , which is not noticeable in the plans .
traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a big problem for the building ru@@ pp of the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers before red lights and bul@@ locks is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the Stum@@ pp company have been working with the work on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked dinner , they don &apos;t use a stove .
they even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ peaceful ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is normally called a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the bon@@ ded wool is removed with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and dev@@ oured .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where they also perform their daily work , e.g. clothes with d@@ ull water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were assigned to her fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course late to work can be dangerous , most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are heavy , and there are soldiers .
&quot; no one says it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was included in 1969 by a controversial referendum in Indonesia to vote on a public H@@ ander@@ thal before the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which touched independence against the Dutch rule , turned against the government of Jakarta that maintains control of the region , foreign journalists or legal observ@@ ations .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so se@@ clu@@ ded as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning @-@ hour car journey by car .
there is no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo forests , and made of corrugated roofs that were converted into various yellow tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , but journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries promised Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a god called U@@ GA Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates her lively , hand woven tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor country where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality rates and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has dismant@@ led gold and copper to a value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood@@ resources in the value of estimated $ 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , ensure that Indonesia &apos;s em@@ power@@ ment has retained a ch@@ ok@@ ing presence .
a study conducted by 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ ge@@ an and units between 1998 and 2004 were nearly 20 million US dollars , among them up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars at a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for larger autonomy threat@@ ens these golden g@@ ans and are treated for mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
according to mass@@ acres , mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as stem cell in the 1970 &quot; s , in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are becoming all things , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a report by the Erz@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about at@@ ro@@ cities and torture - ra@@ pe and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal rainf@@ all of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims , since every week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have made a chance of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is up to 83 % of Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ anese War@@ ning cant@@ ons sell chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce .
local people fight for here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ eth You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local , who went to the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - its market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in Volk@@ sm@@ und as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his election campaign in 2014 , promised the ine@@ qualities and the rights violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will meet our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children &apos;s ro@@ cking children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the soldiers took a violation of her clay , and returned later with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and killed the group with their guns , they said victims and witnesses .
then he fired one of the soldiers to the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ em@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things started the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field before the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they contributed to the cerem@@ on@@ ial hun@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle constantly and a bir@@ d@@ ang im@@ itated - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to tow bricks on police and military post .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent out a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have been killed more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; said it in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending risk and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around myself , I suddenly shot up into my left hand wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E at the porch of his colourful wooden house .
kay@@ ame still does not know who has fired , but says that the bul@@ let was gathered from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ da was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and under@@ went his body to make sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indones@@ ians only bears a name , the TIM@@ E in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spec@@ tor of Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de told repor@@ ters that his officers were just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threat@@ ening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others hurt .
the news about the k@@ illings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to go to Pap@@ ua &apos;s historic du@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security minister Wir@@ anto concluded in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judi@@ cial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to go through these verses , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TIM@@ E on 5 June in Jakarta with TIM@@ E , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is governed by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , charged with the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations had been settled in Pap@@ ua are already settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai pre@@ ference . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with great unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the shooting shops have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police enjoyed the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a farmer , who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man into the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
dedicated vill@@ agers protest@@ ants in front of the company &apos;s location office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers gave stones to officers , re@@ acted by these warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killing a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who was near the hospital , and witness how the injured one has been quickly delivered here , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I hid myself in my house two days . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to draw the officers to account@@ ability and withdraw the police Brigade of the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an unknown stove for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many of the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) joined the re@@ bel army , claims to def@@ ending the rights of Pap@@ ua by pushing it to escal@@ op@@ ian attacks and expl@@ or@@ tions of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ ya Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and taken randomly , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing of national sover@@ eign@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some dive never again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten location . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as far as reach .
the people here build everything they eat : mainly Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women that can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they are most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten Pie@@ ces Not@@ a cost@@ umed only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , which have arrived in large numbers since the opening of new floods at the airport .
the few jobs , which are in the region , usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or necessary skills to run their own company competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , limitations of the coverage international media are cl@@ amped .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to raise the limitations of coverage to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to tell of Indonesia &apos;s un@@ settled provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua . please note : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six p@@ acific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; Differ@@ ent and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have histor@@ ically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a Nas@@ ir rejected the alle@@ g@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to use the evidence of human rights matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to ackno@@ wledge this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura took him on 4 May , who took their silence and than@@ ked him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a source that also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Indonesia , 2019 has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua would probably say that they probably won &apos;t be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai the chairman of the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a r@@ umin@@ ical military , is in poor condition and health service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ars made a last symbolic act of Trot@@ sky@@ ism : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried on a terrain opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they will never forget justice , but at least they do not forget the responsibilities of their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with sealed head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
on Friday , a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in Dubai to flee the book and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per just two years , which is called acci@@ dental the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries have been reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; a inhabitants telling his name as George , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 p.m. GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooled down .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for the people concerned .
the incident can question the safety of materials used in external areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation through the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 showed that the largest part of the damages caused by the cl@@ adding , the exterior protective clothing for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for isol@@ ating and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fur Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through its big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the two @-@ third revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single , was not only supported by the two @-@ third majority .
this is often very long , but also very estimated Five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore barely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members not assume the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the applicants .
even at the vote , after many claims before the proposal has arrived , the fin@@ als must be reached on a neutral place .
new in 2018 only compar@@ atively smaller details : thus fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the right to host the host right in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements in training places etc will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete the Davis Cup less official media event .
more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ ellers brings forbidden objects to the aircraft , finds out a survey
a survey of air@@ passages revealed that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ately or un@@ consci@@ ously forbidden objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration are ver@@ ified , among them at least 6 percent , which rates the aircraft , while it acci@@ d@@ ently banned knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had bel@@ ied that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 persons - which has been carried out by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather det@@ ach the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , the enco@@ res , that they have tried to fly with something that was forbidden from the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally le@@ aded to T@@ SA agents were food@@ stuffs and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave them to have been carried wis@@ ely items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of women question@@ ed and 3.7 percent of the male survey@@ ed also confirmed that they would have been deliber@@ ately banned drugs into the plane .
the company said , I asked those travelers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware could have done through the airport security and how many things were deliber@@ ately done .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who are most likely to s@@ mu@@ g@@ ly s@@ mu@@ g@@ ly or un@@ wi@@ per - by security , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complex and conf@@ using .
humans are often uncertain about which liquids can take away or how much of it .
it &apos;s not a surprise that the biggest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by T@@ SA are prohibited .
for a time , the people thought that T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now he has under@@ gone that a part of the customer has with@@ drawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ al numbers , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has betra@@ yed another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancellations made at the new mass market Model 3 for the first time .
in recent months , Mus@@ k had applied more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
Mus@@ k now dreamed a : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 63@@ .000 have already been re@@ tra@@ ced back .
critics still pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding event .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 USD and the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) of the reservation .
currently there are 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations made in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
that the cancellation of up to date , about twelve percent of all orders would become problem , the Tesla boss would not believe .
its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production site .
in the previous year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 it will be available to all models - 500,000 , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently there are 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have ordered a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; may be at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tesla manages it , his brand new , never been tested in practice without bigger inter@@ ru@@ ptions with maximum utiliz@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EPA chief Pru@@ itt asks for the execution of the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took back the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused air pollut@@ ants .
Pru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be the needs of government environmental authorities earlier than previous devast@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous place in a federal court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline that ran on October 1 for States to comply with the standards of O@@ zone by 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pru@@ dential announced in June that he may have dis@@ continued the observ@@ ance for a year to study the plan and to avoid being able to im@@ itate the plan and im@@ pe@@ de in local decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of Oklahoma , was a long time being a reliable opponent , stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , Pru@@ itt repe@@ ats to block up or to delay , regul@@ ating the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the Pru@@ dential Roll@@ back Agenda .
last month a federal court in Washington decided that EPA has sur@@ passed its authority as he tried to implement a rule of the Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ cks to be delayed .
in one on Wednesday evening , Pru@@ dence proposed that his revers@@ al at the o@@ zone standards just claimed the read@@ iness of the EPA to collabor@@ ate with the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfil@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous devast@@ ations , the EPA often has not kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited for activ@@ ating activists and others , and in an agreement made the deadline for carrying out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who failed to negoti@@ ate the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in case of judi@@ cial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EP@@ O said that Pru@@ itt would be able to use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
in the last month of the bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules shall be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet provided in the Senate .
the New York general prosec@@ utor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who accompanied the Coalition of the states who test@@ i@@ fies the EPA in this week , the group int@@ end to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New York , which are affected directly from the smo@@ g who flows directly from the smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tail@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York is in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone arises , when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere will respond to sunlight .
the smo@@ ther@@ ly smo@@ g can cause serious respir@@ atory problems in sensitive groups , and affects thousands of premature deaths each year .
representative of the public health sector and the environmental prot@@ ector rejo@@ iced over Pru@@ dential exchange changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is troubled , how much pressure is needed to maintain this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ori Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to fight against the ide@@ ological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to tackle environmental poll@@ uting and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery @-@ A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 pm for a Seren@@ ade .
whether his idyllic location and beautiful view on the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the Six@@ th benefit @-@ Seren@@ ade can con@@ j@@ ure from this powerful place .
salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of their concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ izes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the year 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ en@@ elle has been mentioned in a t@@ ang@@ ulated document . Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the following parish church on the Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , the Tum@@ linger mountain stood on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church , one of the former parish church , to which the church or the patron , and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , it was in addition to the village and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen today , the &quot; Mountain &quot; is the third one of the beautiful sett@@ lements of the village .
old maps of the period around the year 1600 supports these historical conditions .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht was made of the early medieval owner of the ministry .
a Lord , who built a church and occupied with a priest , remained in the owner of this church and was able to inherit it .
this was the right to put a priest or to introduce a new priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger one of the two zer@@ oes at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell stands for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be submitted later in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were wrapped and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church was threatened in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius @-@ cemetery served as the last resting @-@ place for the dead from the list@@ eners .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the church tower was standing .
in the New Year 18@@ 34 a storm sank the church tower and half crashed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was canc@@ eled .
only the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still remained today as a witness to the 750 years old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berg and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are maintaining the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the organis@@ er invite friends and supporters of Tum@@ ling@@ erie on Sunday , 16 July , for the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ en@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Kepler High School and with wording by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Matt@@ e@@ is .
Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the programme starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place for the break of the Seren@@ ade in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers offer fantastic views .
the Seren@@ ade takes place only with dry weather .
the organiz@@ ers hope to support many supporters from the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is important for tum@@ ours and list@@ eners .
friends and sponsors of Tum@@ ling@@ ens feel particularly committed to his home care , as a ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
club wants to test permission from wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal conditions for the construction and has therefore turned to the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been promp@@ ted by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the creation of planned wind turbines in the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer n@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved by the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . only at the point in Vier@@ sen , a Wind@@ force @-@ Con@@ centr@@ ation zone has existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time causes the concentration zone for the rest of the wind energy use .
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen decided to place a second wind blo@@ gger zone in the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the district of Düsseldorf has not approved , because of a form of forms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of planning legal conditions , the granted approval of approval is illegal and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current state of things : the city council again decided to re@@ mark the wind concentration camp in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit from the District Government is still pending . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this point is the issu@@ ance of approval for the establishment of wind turbines planned legally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the mag@@ n@@ itude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the respective writings have been dealt with in the circle for past week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion , to prove the matter again .
but they are not likely to do that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of ongoing trial , the district court wanted to express itself in content to the reas@@ oning of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW is planning on an area at the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines .
already in the past year , the company had been involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved , P@@ acht@@ al contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 acres of land closed .
with construction of four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered by around 11 400 households - this is equivalent to a fifth of all quad@@ ru@@ pe@@ er households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the last summer , Vier@@ winden renovated green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a holding in a wind tur@@ bine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the county Hein@@ sberg .
car and Tra@@ ctor together : woman dies with terrible accident
one horri@@ fic traffic accident took place on Friday morning against 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ bur@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal .
two more persons were slightly hurt .
the state road remained blocked by hours .
after police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman came from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car in the frame of accompanying driving with her 53 year old mother as an accompanying person to the L 333 in direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and tra@@ ders plan &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bathroom Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial ren@@ dition and the city council want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to l@@ ure the inhabitants for shopping in downtown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the commercial ren@@ dition , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homeland of shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to sens@@ it@@ ise the customers that offers its own city away from the usual supermarket commod@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned for a market with regional providers , similar to the market .
native companies should also present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; mid@@ night sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
the action is not only based on residents of the city and the close region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , internet video and printed bags , which indicate the action weekend , Christian König .
the municipal authority and commercial ren@@ ditions to cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a further step of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Attra@@ ction Center &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is going to go into a further leg of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Attra@@ ction Center &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the well and sold Sunday , convers@@ ations with all business leaders and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the zi@@ pping on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
customer potential will also be re @-@ opened or re @-@ fin@@ alized .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals have lost the city downtown shopping .
at the end , everybody would help to anim@@ ate the city center - up to land@@ lords , the farms of the whole city and clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it lack@@ ed to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y on a network that had been spread mostly , König had said in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with that the third &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homeland of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shopping sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; became the first five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ sa , this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ all@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Day sol@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for appreci@@ ating local trade and its significance for the common@@ place of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action at the age of the I@@ HK and with many partners make also clear that every citizen with its purchase behavior can affect its direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump put a tran@@ scri@@ bed tran@@ scription of telephone calls for Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone call between US president Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called for a telephone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. president im@@ min@@ ated him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started its presidential campaign with the promise to er@@ ect a wall in the southern border of the U.S. , and s@@ wore to Mexico for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ table have also been published and revealed a decent exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr Turn@@ table , that a trade for the US refugees emigrated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ri@@ di@@ culous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would look at him as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would look like a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and has contributed to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge , a group of white men came forth with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ ist - a man middle age in a needle strip - took a long turn on his cig@@ ar , looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside out the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cried out the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene was played on the 22nd July , only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them in the audience were very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights has come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , to im@@ itate the night in two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody has ever been indicted for murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ clear that in all these years no single person was arrested , although we know they are in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Brook@@ s who helps with the reproduction organization .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Brook@@ s is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a long @-@ man citizen .
for him , the post@@ ure serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to pursue it , we want healing , we want to cure , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a place of jurisdiction presents a sheet of bed on the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files that were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding County were suspected of susp@@ ect in the ly@@ re process .
but nobody was accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the susp@@ ects stay on the free foot for decades , civil rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it for the first time in Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer .
at the same time , as the choice of the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com moved with a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Brook@@ s said that rum@@ ours was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby was wearing her not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to release Mal@@ com from prison so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey into prison .
but when they approached the prison and approached by Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b drew the car around .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who has prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; includes a FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the government and local prosecution that was not only involved in murder , has removed evidence and has rejected the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brook@@ s form@@ ulates it even more distinctive .
&quot; it was a elec@@ toral law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you vote , and if you vote , you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost one decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual demand of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , productive and fo@@ unds in a type of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe he doesn &apos;t exist any more in America .
it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confron@@ ted with the ugly into all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen or hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whit@@ ish and the rest of black - in a room and l@@ ur@@ ned when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he played the role of chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ i since years , but he said that he never become easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to obtain this story in life , because we would not wish to return to those days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com who scre@@ ams and troubled him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He turned away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona dis@@ gu@@ sts the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody leaves ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs most lou@@ dly .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still k@@ ich@@ ever .
&quot; I just don &apos;t believe white people at that time &apos; n &apos; it &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only need to make the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there is energy in space , a sense of camera will replace the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is busy trying to get this properly , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene started once again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely nobody laughs .
this rep@@ et@@ ition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a fun@@ eral dress stands on the bodies of the actors and leads Che@@ e Holidays sad cur@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice is broken at every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears out of the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and White .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many arrive only the street .
you have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as impressive humidity every eight hours , when Brook@@ s leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de stayed an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ se feels , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , sign up the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes you ow@@ es Gre@@ ene the lot - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw the ly@@ we@@ dge away and wi@@ pe off her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit which the C@@ lan@@ member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona usually embra@@ ced two of his players and then breaks down in her arms , and the emotional burden of performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pered one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience put together with actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta avo@@ ids a white pair , inspired by a black couple who just got to know .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... by people who look like you and do what they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this is really doing with me , makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ ure is inspiring , as it describes the terror of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like we can learn from it , then it can happen again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , he does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with cast@@ or , but it also has grown understanding for its view .
I draw a positive res@@ ume .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in a voluntary year equal to several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally at Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once in week I help in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge .
and I worked at the school in an open full day .
how are your experiences with that ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees and young adults .
they are now 26 years old , so a late volunteer program .
how does it come ?
quantity : I did S@@ LC .
and then a design studies , let us say , successfully canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognized for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it might be on site , at the focal point , too , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not something unusual , while volunteers have several different applications ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you will be FS@@ J .
one can make it from age @-@ home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me , this was exactly the right thing that has irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it goes out .
else than in the civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about to expect st@@ ati@@ ques .
there are always other people a head , each other with a different story .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager has been re@@ covering from the family - one has to be remembered individually .
very interesting .
and you had no touch of contact ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there is also negative moments , but such is life .
Pear@@ son shortened further 3,000 jobs and will be shortened to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will start further 3,000 jobs and cut off their inter@@ mitt@@ ance by 72 per cent as a further restructuring programme will be started to overcome the company with which the company faces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the job director , General John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 jobs .
Pear@@ son announced a plan to cost more 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in a third cost programme to anim@@ ate a business again , which was hit by fast step towards digital learning .
the company , which had sold last month &apos;s involvement in Penguin Rand@@ om House , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i Attack of Kabul : NATO soldier killed at self @-@ murder
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy on the Afghan capital of Kabul , killed one of Nato soldiers and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter had been hurt , a declaration of Nato distributed .
Un@@ confirmed local reports according to the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district died also three civilians .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has made this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ bers killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of Nato , the explosion on Thursday evening should be done when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised spr@@ inkl@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement is said that all injured in a stable condition are treated at the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a big concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , there were about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ bers killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the fatal mil@@ it@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ guided troops attacked the Taliban by power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ scores the pre@@ dominant security situation in Afghanistan , since US president Donald Tr@@ ump continues to raise the number of U.S. troops to raise the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ate in Kabul have also caused a crisis in public confidence in the government , its policy and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule after complaints
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to regul@@ ate the government by Obama to ban the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 countries accused the agency due to the step@@ ping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced its decision on Wednesday which so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they show the obligation of the agency to work together with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA @-@ Chief Scott Pru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , the intention of the EPA had announced the o@@ zone provisions , which should be measured in a part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions , to determine where parts must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay one year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 most democratic states , together with the Colombia district , filed a claim on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .
the government of president Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to impos@@ e a wide range of environmental impact , which imposed by the former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of demo@@ c@@ rates and reserves that worry about the effects of larger emissions to public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O &apos;s website tells you that the o@@ zone inhal@@ e has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce the lung function and rein@@ force respir@@ atory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as asthma symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal budget wants common room
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end the decision was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two oppos@@ ing votes , the council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ ds decides to set up a common room in the future senior citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing property is signed , reports Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will still last until the date of the Church leader belonged to the property of Municip@@ ality , but there is now no plans for creating a private investor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the council will be suspended such a common room not as a meeting place only for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ical living area , but open to the community .
as an example , the word made of &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Cafe &quot; the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision will make the decision by providing funds for the current budget already last autumn , by funding options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is situated in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported T@@ j@@ ads , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision to sign@@ alize in order to sign@@ alize the investor , that in this regard , there is no b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , and that which depends on the environment - as well as p@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the tr@@ illion and the construction of economic power - is possible .
unnecessary , so does not only mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this additi@@ ve .
when it helps : he unanim@@ ously has the board .
it &apos;s not that simple while common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one can not come forward now with the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks absolutely for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
it looks behind a conc@@ e@@ aled payout of property or even foreign investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area you don &apos;t give any subsi@@ dy , but get a real , in doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sta@@ ig@@ ers Demand , the decision with@@ drawn , finds three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this way , there is two oppos@@ ing words at the original program , Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we deal with this decision , we make a huge step in our infrastructure to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the resin of star to star hike
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz , the national &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should emer@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planning the association Ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet &apos;s path is in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; coming to the information need of many har@@ es visitors , it was called .
it offers nature , science , movement and athlet@@ ic performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase to 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations from five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is scheduled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quire , St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Brown , Ho@@ he@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
information on the panels are to be added via the Internet .
this is why the site selection is a good mobile network reception .
accessi@@ bility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad train is scheduled to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experience a lot of knowledge , for example about physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star stronger than another , although he is much further away .
also , in which constellation can be a selected star and when he is best to see .
since 2014 , the association has been operating in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , located at the highest nearby ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
the plant is in the middle of the National Park , according to the Federal Office of Natural Prot@@ ecting the six dark regions in Germany .
frequently from there , the Mil@@ k Road and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy are clearly visible with the naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt since 2003 it has been a somewhat similar to the initiative of the sponsor@@ ship planet@@ arium , such as the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - the Planet@@ arium .
starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the planet leads up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as an ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( the same village ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ ints with the individual planets - including the Zwerg@@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ unk thus on a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meter diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , the sun is at least 70 centi@@ meters .
the whole planet distance is about four kilometers .
while the light of sun needed up to the Plu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than light in the world .
the march towards the next fix@@ ture but would last a half year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia in a coll@@ ision course should be staged in a coll@@ ision competition in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia the defeated World Boxing Council Light@@ weight champion , which went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Organisation Super spring @-@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous resolution on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia put out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ ott on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the pair of photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring of spring , &quot; Garcia .
&quot; I switched to Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to run down to light weight .
and he has to move forward to light weight &#91; 135 &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko unanim@@ ously voted .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate policy asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that has to fight in the next summer with Garcia a date to be agreed with Garcia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who is also interested in the fight against the winners of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight title contest on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia and pressed later openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this type of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia he said Lom@@ ach@@ enko and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a massive fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he might participate in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held up with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the three fight Champion from River@@ side is very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you were seeking the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
Garcia said the focus is to show impact strength , then boxing .
they both said they could feel the momentum , which he built for his own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I &apos;m more than happy to work with it , &quot; said Garcia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighter , and that is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire space
with an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost to 16.@@ 30 shortly before the connection to the market broad , presumably after a tire space the control over his vehicle .
the car dra@@ gged to the right into the sp@@ ells , where it struck and then stuck on the roof in the ridge .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the initial power supply through the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic could be laid back on the left strip at the accident site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; dirt chain is better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann tru@@ sts after 2 : 2 at the end of the season in Braunschweig that optimi@@ zing the defense information in Au@@ e points .
at the first season , Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result that the two opponents would not have been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit into Au@@ e much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense of Fortuna Düsseldorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the triple chain should also be further optimised .
and a fool according to a state , the sa@@ unas want no more che@@ eks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) puts on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is even better right after the experience in preparation with the chain chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not yet know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure to be able to have up the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but we are even more harmon@@ ic and we don &apos;t afford to accomplish so many play@@ ful errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one can talk after a mis@@ placed start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could well be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points , we will certainly be able to concentrate on the cup of poker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing wanted to know about that trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season only after six to eight players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who did not want to speak of an advantage over to Au@@ e , only because the game of the Sax@@ ons had to be canc@@ eled due to a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even be a bit of fresh , because they wouldn &apos;t be he@@ avier and a full game like Fortuna against an asc@@ ension favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know that 100 % where they currently stand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the internal def@@ enders of Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland become a lighter favorite on Sunday into the encounter in the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we can make them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat for auction from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd league which you have to strike at first , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Che@@ f@@ coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new Results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everybody believes in accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) has begun with the test of tests last year .
they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum seek@@ ers , after the Swedish migration Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ational ) for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees .
until now migration completes 6.@@ 880 down@@ stream cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older than in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency took that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant in the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has been lied about its age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that it was supposed to be 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det asked the results published 5@@ 81 , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said frank@@ ly that they become 18 years old .
in some areas , the method of medical treatment assessment began to be analysed by denti@@ sts and MRI recordings that are then critic@@ ized by denti@@ sts and Radi@@ ologists .
a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus , Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if it so@@ oner or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used .
to judge the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is in it if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in Plan
the work on the three bridges of the road road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton curtain was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reinhold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Transport and Transport in Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , work began at the same time at all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is sure the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the trol@@ ley .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly cleaned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a mar@@ g@@ inal fixing , which is also used as an operating road .
on the southern part of the bridge , a width of 2.@@ 20 metres is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way is supposed to walk .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented frac@@ tures .
the laying of lines made up of lines through the building works in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable that many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting Christmas in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for construction work on Lau@@ ter@@ bacher &apos;s entrance , the street is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three Brü@@ ck@@ en@@ an@@ ings amount to a total amount of 700 000 Euro .
it is financed through the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : fried in protest at German potato salad
&quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t happen often that parties are moving on a strand , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , coming together , what else is difficult to bring to a hat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcan@@ oes ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a wide alliance , which shows the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle ron@@ dell , according to the poster , &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names at the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who forms the top duo for the German elections on 24 September , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already in front of the event before the event , do not want to listen to the AF@@ D files , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally , the city Pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Show all at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Brun@@ d@@ ells , but now directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture which has to offer .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the competent organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the AF@@ D without any problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police used a lot of officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly in the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by AF@@ D volcan@@ oes , he has been trying to stri@@ ve for such an event and received the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because of the already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ her@@ mes not enough parking spaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the ron@@ dell , home@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ ar area he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good law of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : at 20 o &apos;clock in the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , among them the rh@@ einf@@ alls @-@ pf@@ z@@ ic AF@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe boy .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners who are waiting for the German elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold her spe@@ ech@@ es .
the police presence remains unchanged , but the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the AF@@ D event takes a longer breath , but also there is a longer breath , but also there is just after 21 clock .
the police can dis@@ gu@@ ise - no special inci@@ dents .

together with the Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he is a concert under the slogan &quot; Black Sea &quot; meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classic German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winner and award winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European orchest@@ rated orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both un@@ ite the lust , not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ re@@ ist N@@ ils W@@ ig , mix classical , jazz and the free games to an intri@@ gu@@ ing Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart is open to their bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I enjoy a grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of their &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues , Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately went in bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette perform@@ ers insured from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love in love that I did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think about it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation Kri@@ sten said that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I never really liked to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it suffered from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time , when they prefer a bu@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a Bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , anxi@@ ous and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and remember : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public does not love their love life : &quot; people expect you to change in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me as an ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia , announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ c@@ rats were removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a great announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , has been elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes that he has won coal mines in five countries , and have inher@@ ited a carbon business by his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee set out a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party , which would rather be working as it would work to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ances and the control of the least legal bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is from above until below without a guide and is not able to find a positive , unified message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a declaration by C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; hon@@ orable &quot; Russian exc@@ use for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world leader of athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an open exc@@ use from Russia to a doping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken in sports again .
Russian Athlet@@ ics Group D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of athlet@@ ics world championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight against doping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , those with cont@@ ests gold and silver medals &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress agreed on that in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) critics were found on state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has witnessed some fairly hot times and everything possible to make sure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to accept Russia the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress was achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the motto principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; added
n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the athlet@@ ics world championships , starting on Friday in London , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
the Head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , Rune Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setup .
drug tests still are still free and forbidden trainer are still free , he told repor@@ ters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council .
fun@@ eral in Mali on fun@@ eral in Mali
at a fun@@ eral in the North H@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , some 1,000 people were thinking about a helicopter in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
for even un@@ informed crash , Secretary of Defense , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she called the two converted pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ner of their expert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice which they presented in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old chief of northern Italy came to life on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her so@@ cks were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at the mid@@ day only the relatives participated in the church first .
the fun@@ eral of the fun@@ eral in the circle of family , eng@@ bl@@ est friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them there were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Secretary General of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
they laid hands on the ar@@ ros@@ es , and the relatives standing arm in his arm in the bos@@ om .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen drew the converted soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief of the main co@@ g@@ man had built the flight operations of the battle @-@ helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ents , which the soldiers belong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If this occupation could not turn off the crash , no one could have missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dou@@ bts on the UN mission in Mali was not the Minister of the Le@@ yen not : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country which we are separated from two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral of the fun@@ eral , the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr does not make any details .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
it shared the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard had already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , whose name was further in the communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ end to be buried in his own native country .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a h@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
he would be king of King after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ in in 1972 .
in 2016 he went into retirement and also places the title &quot; Prin@@ ciples . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik won &apos;t have the title and function that he wanted , he didn &apos;t see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish King &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old eventually becomes un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ end to be buried in his own native country , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble line@@ age , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked in the French Embassy in the French Embassy .
during his future wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always ex@@ hal@@ ted , Prince Hen@@ rik had a difficult stand in the Dan@@ es as a major state of the Dan@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik passed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk str@@ uts instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , Tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , I smo@@ ked the call instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and the herein , I could not hope to see the brand of social ritual intellec@@ tu@@ als .
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants ras@@ p@@ se re@@ election
CDU and F@@ DP facing a potential majority in Lower Saxony
however , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is facing a rapid re@@ election of the land , but he does not want to re@@ sign .
because on Friday the Parliament &apos;s dis@@ solution was made .
prior to this , the surprising exit of a Green M@@ EPs taken by Prime Minister Stephen Weil ( SPD ) in Lower Saxony has been over@@ thrown into a heavy crisis .
five months before the official time of the country @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its kn@@ itted one @-@ voices majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests established its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared Friday in Hannover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
S &amp; D Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend his faction to record them .
in this way , the CDU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government is now deci@@ ding whether they are able to gover@@ n in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , lasts for un@@ ceas@@ ing that the day of Parliament resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on its further procedure on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state of state also sees the possibility that the Parliament will elect Mr. Prime Minister and elect a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these opportunities must be kept legally clean , &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will answer all your questions , if legally reas@@ on@@ ably checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am no tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she referred to a portrait of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the de@@ pu@@ ties de@@ pu@@ ties to the return of their landing gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are , of course , that she received her coun@@ table , which gives it over the green country list , with immediate effect &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; divided the state @-@ president Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; S &amp; D Group president Anja PI@@ EL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in front of the background that there was no content differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD @-@ Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the CDU as a betra@@ yal of the Lower Saxony @-@ elected Prime Minister El@@ ke T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former green members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the par@@ aly@@ ses , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bund@@ esch@@ ef is on Friday to Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to elect the State Parliament quickly .
the exit of the West Africa costs red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony &apos;s majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last el@@ it@@ el@@ ty and her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ate game and tries to strike the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU @-@ Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CDU .
the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ v@@ ests , with personal career memory thinking the outcome of the 2013 country elections .
the CDU was then in front of the SPD &apos;s strongest power , SPD and green economy had a very thin majority in the country .
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ves , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about processed eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial department of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from poison eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator exactly and check the stamp print .
in the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we know what we currently know , health haz@@ ard is virtually impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best crisis action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the awareness of the Federal Minister of Economics is not really perceived ?
food Monitoring is the role of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately posted immediately and is in terms of respect for Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has just as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are convenient and health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if in eggs the resi@@ du@@ es of resi@@ du@@ es of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time do not blame the farms .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to their knowledge , production companies have no immediate debt .
rather , they have to be liable due to alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damages .
as always , there is too little gro@@ w@@ ess in the harvest .
is it only missing on the staff or even in the mu@@ es@@ ome jurisdiction ?
there were just the official checks that have un@@ covered the procedure .
however , for truth , food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just this is a consistent observ@@ ance of such matters and hand@@ over to the prosec@@ utor in the cases where off@@ ences are possible , of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already made several times clearly that I expect a free En@@ lighten@@ ment by the responsible authorities .
is the regular security mis@@ m really necessary for food sk@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food industry is used , consumers and consumers are too right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the ar@@ mo@@ red means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ d fibro@@ us in the attitude of life @-@ extra@@ dition animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it has to be system@@ atically consistent across all levels and with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is quickly cleared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to interact with the financial rules of the Foot@@ balls on Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered editions of the European football club won &apos;t bo@@ ther Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA nor come , as the leading organisation , which monitors the European game , has power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules that have been called by UEFA ins in 2011 mean that PS@@ G must follow some point that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary , that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars moved to France .
PS@@ G can make sure to make money loose , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar signs and bring it into a galaxy to other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich ruler family of Qatar .
clubs may apply to the purchase of players much money , but have to deal with legitim@@ ate insight , which enable the break @-@ even point in their way to football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that clubs in their quest had taken away enormous debts , effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ ked up , when banks or owners went back their support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , FF@@ P decreased by the concentration on the debts of the clubs on the supervision of their losses .
the change meant that the business model was originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then invested strongly in order to improve the crew and establish a global brand - becoming a harder matter .
while the current three @-@ year FF@@ P reduction period , which runs until 2018 , clubs will take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini had fallen from the presidency in un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to set off excess expenditure .
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clau@@ se from Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it may distribute the amount for the invoice over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five year contract , so that the trigger for the next five years can be paid in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P @-@ sanctions in 2014 together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , met with the most severe sanctions .
PS@@ G was reduced to EUR 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to EUR 20 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players rather than usual 25 players .
the UEFA is looking for clubs who could try to out@@ lines their financial support by connecting their income by companies that are connected to owners of a clubs .
while a cataly@@ tic company could be transp@@ onder@@ s , if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEFA EURO would not apply as legitim@@ ate revenues .
exactly that happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA was removed by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could be found on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s World Championship will simply be able to find out such a man@@ eu@@ ver for the UEFA regul@@ ators .
the former sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA nor hear@@ er will be aware of the rules to avoid the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , so on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million with a profit of more than € 10 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing deal , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ k@@ ot@@ echnology .
the association anticip@@ ates that sales after the signature is at least 30 percent .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s way , that PS@@ G viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finance D@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose organisation is owned by an American Sports @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservation of La League against a State which is financed by a society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the whole landscape of the Foot@@ balls in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new chocolate supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate was made for the Swiss .
now the working relationship is in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the job .
Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA on request a paper report on the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would check every two to three years and undergo a quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; she said .
around 17 million small red white packaged chocolate panels to 14 grams annually spread the flight manager before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss Life wouldn &apos;t want to make any information about the costs .
industry Bank estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is all the promotional effect : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ver , it is a prestigious order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how many applicants about the new call , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the Swiss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible to a statement .
chocolate tablets distri@@ butes Swiss Life since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros Dau@@ ghter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the possibility of placing the logo , Swiss made two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
the customers of First Class with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli will indul@@ ged in Business Class n@@ aschen passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lind@@ t and in the Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

as a cultural object , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its sur@@ fers ( it contained an original story for a speaking box of vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by focusing on the heart of the g@@ ags - actor middle ages play hor@@ ny children who grow up - they still create the possibility to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults is less emotional roots and his par@@ ody go more after the wat@@ ering can of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that cra@@ dle the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character set out by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite More@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ icious plot involved in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos; sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ Man @-@ on Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are the moments acci@@ dental mad@@ ness to take this fran@@ chise like a kind of repe@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to see what I will show what I will show as its logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whose final scene will show the gang of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon rec@@ alls a different kind of nost@@ al@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its east anti @-@ West ring combat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka were created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ run Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alog@@ ues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ized in English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful days to see ( the police spend time to watch chess on TV , like Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including Jenny Sl@@ ate , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Sev@@ igny - provides the voice out of a decent game of &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda @-@ drama - a mur@@ derer which bears a Re@@ agan M@@ ask is included - that there is often a single one .
with six long episodes the com@@ edy is gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was transferred to a lower length , could visit his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , as Gregory and I@@ os@@ ef is again occupied the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a b@@ unch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for a schol@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot;

blow against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in R@@ ott@@ weil , Const@@ ance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart have searched numerous objects like the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors on Friday .
15 acc@@ us@@ ation was arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and issued an arrest warrant against this .
the officials also provided major amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same raid in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will therefore be extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
the action was involved in the Italian and Bavarian Investig@@ ators .
over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia is a crime crime , severe crimes committed , attemp@@ ted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the Office of Const@@ ance had been determined by the organized drug traff@@ icking in the south of Germany .
between the prosec@@ utor in Konstan@@ z and Palermo there was a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po R@@ ott@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the large opening on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
on the visor of investigations , Italian national nationals combined with reference to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
a incident occurred on May 27 , during the early morning , several shots were fired at a guest house in early mor@@ nings .
manner lam@@ ents big g@@ aps in fore@@ ig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emer@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ ig@@ ner stops in Germany has significant lack of defects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
the supervision for refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , according to a media report , according to major g@@ aps in the country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lack of registered data could result in asylum procedures and deportation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; war@@ med way in an analysis that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the regist@@ ers , ten million people are recorded with foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality has not been well in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men who have long been no longer in life , or from citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data rates can greatly slow down the reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on the travel visa , the EU citizens are recorded , which would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such wrong orders led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dis@@ semin@@ ated debate about dealing with reis@@ ep@@ rint , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has begun to return to Italy with under 16 year old children , when they traveled from there .
this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New Osnab@@ ru@@ cker newspaper . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it is called the BA@@ MF using such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , virtually no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Convention , the EU State is responsible for refugees to achieve them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the In@@ trav@@ eland .
for the reas@@ oning : &quot; now the admission capacity for families with minor children increased considerably in Italy . &quot;
Italy have handed over for the admission and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold these promises sufficient .
other EU states would also send the refugees back to the Dublin near the Dublin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children above the lack of lack of admission in the Italian asylum system of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach was already available to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
all of Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile distributed 50 litres of blood with his meanwhile 100 liters .
traditionally , the congregation in the session of the Municipal Council comm@@ ends multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome as our body is created for this and we are tender to provide the don@@ or respect , which make their blood be available for strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood@@ stream helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned parts are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , three persons could benefit from a blood@@ stream .
at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported from the actions which will be carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rich@@ enbach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we generated the second best result with 114 verses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change in the theater house was reduced to higher numbers a few years ago .

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation would have d@@ amped the spec@@ ulation about a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fied pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 instead of holding interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , where weak economic growth has been weak@@ ened in this month as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in its fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % , and anticip@@ ated that the pressure would continue to rise in fiscal 2017 , whereas inflation is expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , it would be necessary to breed inflation , and she said that credit costs may have had more than expected on financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth business package that was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will provide time for finance plan to provide financial funds for banks , although said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - with 115 billions of pounds sterling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC remains weak ( GDP ) short term , since the pressure on the re@@ side of households continued to accum@@ ulate consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain beam of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required for cooling down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; level , than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets also include the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank has stressed that enh@@ ancements were &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank forecast for this and next year correc@@ ts the forecast for this and next year , compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has retained its growth forecast based on 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change comes after the most disappo@@ inting growth figures have d@@ amped the increasing expectations of a interest rate and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the second quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover from the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that become affected by an increasing inflation and lower salary levels , because the ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation becomes even worse before they become better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the income of income &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages becomes clear to the end of their three @-@ year plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate a part of the lower consumer expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lower@@ ing interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the singing of the fun@@ ic@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the economy and economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the final judgment of the bank on interest rates , the call for a interest rate has increased , since inflation increased their pressure on hard drives , with a increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be able to attract them in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the surplus in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shorter return of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again , because the l@@ us@@ ement would want to quit and end the year in a positive manner .
the market looks especially well for those who run the existing deals and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with extra @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) aims to drive 10,000 people in controversial HIV drug

sexual health risks in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first that they will enable the application of people , and other clinics will follow shortly before it will be introduced to England in April 2018 .
pre@@ positi@@ vity phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP has significantly reduced the HIV transmission on cancer risk .
to take Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse , that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come for the treatment in question include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ cies and individuals who have one partner , whose HIV status is not known to have anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who are registered in England and register with a house@@ keeper may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines in this week after an international competitive pro@@ cu@@ rement .
the study aims to assess the whole potential of Pr@@ EP by clinical evidence as used in large scale , recorded and implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this large intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and over@@ take . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in tack@@ ling one of the largest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted specifically to needy and endangered people , the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England will have to develop a new instrument that will be truly individually controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of Ter@@ r@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority is now to reach the study quickly throughout the country and that no one has left a risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ medicine was provided , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and ob@@ sol@@ ete by the government after months of delay and delay .
evidence demonstr@@ ating how the drug may be as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and can end transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as fast as possible in the whole country to protect people that are infected by HIV , and that they will contribute to the end of the prolifer@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designers tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 from a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a t@@ iled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne Stau@@ ber and an mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my request , &quot; she says .
to this end , she ordered the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill that was to use 12.5 feet high ceilings , which was not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed together without hes@@ ive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right level for the function up or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold@@ furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in addition to theatre , space and light .
on both ends is a short corridor mir@@ ro@@ red to let him longer work .
in the kitchen the refle@@ ctions feel like a window in another room .
at the entrance , we mir@@ ro@@ red units room for all the bur@@ sts and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the kitchen can exclu@@ de the kitchen , if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing is that it is a Gar@@ den@@ ü@@ r .
&quot; a bit of engineering things went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced MDF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so it is , if you push up the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ ing use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne was able to win an additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor area and use high @-@ quality materials , which provide space to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love in the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be converted by a good design and increased square met@@ er@@ ings of somewhat standard in something very aston@@ ishing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a 500 million US real estate imperi@@ al
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the biggest real estate in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as , worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is is living in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy the property and its business administration .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confron@@ tation on the separation occurs in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 real estate in more than half a billion dollar , accumulated since the family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , bought in 1973 .
there the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , the development of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centres in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her late father Colin - von Paul has described as &quot; main operator &quot; and the domin@@ ating personality in the family of De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one @-@ third .
a judi@@ cial states that this means that Colin &apos;s property has valued at $ 316 million and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven to Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the messages proposed by Colin have left him with the idea what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice last Friday took place last Friday .
the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - Colin as Paul claims to be excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some owners .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was handed down by Colin he , he , he hope to teach the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs are rising in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held attorney .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ acy of the late 1950 &quot; s and in the early sevent@@ e@@ eties a shop bought in Brun@@ swi@@ ck .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in Colin the first je@@ ans of the family opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colin says that he began West@@ co as he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , trusted her property to pass on her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is company group . Colin claims that Mark were paid in leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept herself back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and following a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw on our family name through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope in a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the dishes , &quot; Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps of Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct media ab@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope , the boss .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the Chief of Staff of the White House , met his first working day with executive employees , he set up a major problem in president Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps white House , which he will repair : bad information that will come into the hands of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told us that information about him should flow - whether on paper or post@@ ings , because the president would make better decisions when he would get good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by super@@ v@@ ise his media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television reaches decades - and now where he is in the White House is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Tr@@ ump was upset because of un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of vac@@ an@@ cies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election agent Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote about the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habits under control , according to six former elec@@ toral civil servants , is to ensure that his personal media sum contains a permanent praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habits ever &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ di@@ culous .
perhaps these campaigns were aware of what we don &apos;t know - that tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets could have had more ignition without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably never learn something about twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his staff had created it for a few times , trouble from him , then their efforts have been worth it .
but nobody has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
a part of the problem is that people in a White House , which are made up of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by supporting a Tr@@ ump material , that may possibly help her views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - totally occupied with this story - told in May on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ er to carry out reasons for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative media cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and to find out where they origin@@ ate from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; exactly that happened at the end of February , when somebody accused a printed copy of a article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prov@@ oc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the source behind a b@@ unch of being at the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Johnson has been ban@@ ished from Twitter or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he expressed false acc@@ us@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and its consult@@ ants are still in effect .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ er Pre@@ crimin@@ als get Post of Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the aid of the population is praying and hop@@ ed .
the police throughout Europe were sent to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) postcards of dangerous crimin@@ als .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ crimin@@ als are naturally not known , indications of the population is hop@@ ed and praying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience had been shown that many vol@@ atile vac@@ ations are hidden from Europ@@ ol from Europ@@ ol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website has been viewed on www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ende , more than 2.5 million times .
36 The online audit@@ ors could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them were due to the publication after the publication on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to &apos; million@@ aires &apos; range &apos;
some of the weal@@ th@@ iest home@@ owners in the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute trav@@ ellers , who negoti@@ ated one from the commune , to rec@@ la@@ im a field before their man@@ ors .
the travelers have par@@ ked up their 20 caravans on a field outside a weal@@ thy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called &quot; million@@ aires row . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transporter , having been exposed only in May , without being deported from the Council of excav@@ ation , to prevent their fail@@ ures .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the line of defence and pressed her vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ ged inhabitants have ra@@ ged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they were cast stones into the Pass@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council has to be forced by shame to implement in fact because he was us@@ eless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , moved and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by long teaching positions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my property if the Council can &apos;t stop this once . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a locals who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ri@@ di@@ culous , we just saw the last round of this trav@@ eller just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures have increased this time and we even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ am@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal steps to move it as fast as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our exercise collection , it is very important that as many residents are an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police as they call 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freud is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1st March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with the then ambi@@ ance of the hotel Du@@ k@@ enhof , the company was lost on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights per year , and proceeds from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , faced with the numbers of refugees caught in the county , the hotel building in the county , served as a collection accommodation , provided for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but above all , Freud &apos;s Mayor , Julian Os@@ s@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and already spoke of serious inci@@ dents at the house .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been there for longer time construction containers in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear which extensive renov@@ ations will be made .
the floors were torn out , blan@@ kets are partly dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are fitted with large walk showers , the input field is designed , new windows are installed .
everything sol@@ der later was &quot; nice , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expres@@ sing .
&quot; we want to make a jewel . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
you will not be positioned on the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but also emphas@@ ises a higher inner city center .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms will be broad and explains more .
both individual tourists , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael K@@ rau@@ se he was already led .
the idea of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to define exactly .
under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also placed on fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard a large terrace which is accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Jury sets a Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s affair , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is supposed to have a special jury appointed by Robert Mu@@ eller according to a report a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in the past weeks , the Panel recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal with the thing confi@@ dential .
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
CNN CNN reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the body in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian advoc@@ ate .
U.S. intelligence services blame the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time , specifically into the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps Election Bal@@ aam and Moscow .
in the main focus of investigations , several men are supposed to act as an advisor to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to the report , Mu@@ eller took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps of private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ kom@@ mando Tr@@ ump stayed in the center and supp@@ ressed the alle@@ g@@ ations if the president of the affair may be hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to prove and decide whether the charges should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the Prosecutor .
usually they are turned on when it is bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to re@@ charge people for hearing under E@@ id .
according to the CNN , CNN already showed pre @-@ inv@@ itations to turn around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. they were also Tr@@ um@@ ps Consult@@ ant and @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the interview .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening in US television that Mu@@ eller is not in@@ ti@@ mi@@ red in his work , and that he should be necessary to take action quickly .
but it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the en@@ forcement of the committee began in the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for president Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia , in order to represent the Russian affair than the campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme give the demo@@ c@@ rats a way of feeling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feeling good because they don &apos;t have anything else than they can speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he know@@ eth nothing of the implementation of a Grand Jury .
but this work usually works in secret , stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that acceler@@ ate the work of the special medi@@ ator on &quot; fair &quot; manner .
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey told three times that it would not be determined against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something changed because it was in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this root , the acc@@ us@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he intended to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June , in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the former National Security Advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under large pressure because of the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the special medi@@ ator and its employees .
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
unlike an independent special issue of con@@ gres@@ ses , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Mu@@ eller ruled the position later , in which he could be fired theore@@ tically based on ur@@ gency of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators on Thursday could not be dismissed on Thursday , after which the special survey could not be released .

it is 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest iron giant who have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people does not go out from him .
to what extent of climate change has played a role at the crash of the ice@@ berg is un@@ clear after research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ down@@ s in the region around 30 years , the U.S. Research Center for Snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) writes in a fact . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the broken piston was now part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
thus it grows further into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this palace was the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um of wa@@ xes and break off several years ago .
a full swing is falling there , A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes .
there is much to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge I have never with@@ drawn so far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate below tension and can be broken , if a piece is broken at a key .
the melt from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg does not increase sea level as they swim in the water , and ice cream so much water as it produces in the melt itself .
however , the loss of lower@@ ing means that the glacier is directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in the low dimensions , the British research project writes about the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the four @-@ largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the open ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural happening and un@@ aware that there is no direct link to climate change , it now comes into a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among schol@@ ars be cont@@ ested , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now come back and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers did not return the crash of this gigantic ice@@ berg not to climate change , however , many ice sk@@ ies of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long line of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica stret@@ ches towards South America .
according to the data of the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the decline of temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the past 50 years and count them in the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CDU wants pets and pets in the staff
because it is becoming more difficult to occupy free spots , the CDU calls for the employer to become more attractive .
just shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag increased 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have got their first working day behind .
the teachers of the circle are clearly cov@@ eted .
some 620 applicants have been to be noted for those in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the circle is still lacking in order to overcome the increased demands and tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment , there are currently 50 points in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , physi@@ cians and engineers are looking for general management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU would now want to sei@@ ze the initiative by the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG sei@@ ze the initiative and to appear in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management should work according to the request of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personnel recovery and personal development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term commercial resources on professionals , but forward the application short@@ age is called it .
the overall concept should focus on the inside and outside , concrete action for trans@@ verse and a training offensive , challenge CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with staff problems , which was not known earlier .
other towns advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer attractive more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ age due to the service is ex@@ crete .
highest time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , head of the CDU , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he was already sor@@ row@@ ful in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ aust@@ ere surprise , as he publicly presented his recru@@ itment in question , and the remaining parties prov@@ oked .
people would like to be ver@@ ified , that all possibilities will enable the ex@@ iting from the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t want a satisfactory solution here at a satisfactory solution , the county management with the trade unions - may well stri@@ ve in cooperation with the circular cities - a pet tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , the CDU , employees and officials are trying to pay better than it is actually looking for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , enh@@ ancements or more money , if one changes in a higher level , which is orient@@ ated to vocational years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ st@@ itute protection law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter made a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ated the sound to NGO &apos;s migrant rescue bo@@ oting
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Italy , NGOs operating the life @-@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned that they are not allowed to keep this new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not write a new Code of Con@@ duct , it &apos;s difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German relief organization &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; because they had worked closely with traff@@ ic@@ kers in a way that em@@ ailed an illegal immig@@ ration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation for one year , refused to express itself to detailed acc@@ uses of the Italian national an@@ wal@@ ts Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue areas at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all the acc@@ us@@ ations that are currently collected only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , which has been super@@ vised by I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is assumed that its crew is powered by ding@@ h@@ y immigrants that can be delivered directly from human traff@@ ic@@ kers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that the vessels may be used again .
at least one such meeting was held only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the state of the state of State , which was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of taking place on the authority of Italian coast@@ guards , the rescue sets in the zone of humanitarian reasons , and not from any other mot@@ i@@ fs .
among the code of conduct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board which monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue inserts have been prepared to keep in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ required but acceptable , as they wouldn &apos;t be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their life @-@ actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize winner Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy declined sharp@@ ly in recent weeks , the efforts to strengthen the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and the cooperation with local civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan civil servants in this month about economic development initiatives , and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Mon@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin Foreign Post@@ age &quot; and two guest driver met in Wach@@ enheim in the north @-@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and sights .
three provided guides were available for this .
the accommodation in Wach@@ enh@@ ei@@ mer Valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Forest and the out@@ sour@@ ced levels .
between there was always long asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ ck@@ tails .
on the second day they went to Sal@@ ine to Sal@@ ine and to the popular saus@@ age market .
re@@ ated to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
at the last two days many al@@ ti@@ meter were told again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and excav@@ ators brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker in the open air movement cur@@ ated sole .
Neustadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Forest from its best site - sporty and cultural .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga sets for e @-@ sport
sitting the sports stars in future before computer consoles , rather than swe@@ ating with wind and weather across the stadium to fight ?
fact : e @-@ Sports has long become a lu@@ cr@@ ative industry to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included .
this also recognized the first German lig@@ ator , which increasingly engage in this field .
in the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently followed by the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sports department in mid @-@ July and took two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to insp@@ ire the new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Board of Jochen Ger@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many clubs in this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which gam@@ ers compete in different clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ ver@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen is advis@@ es an agency for virtual football player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Real Football needs to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds , that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the temp@@ ting , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with a prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could have more frequently presence on these markets than once in the year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
in the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation FIFA are foc@@ uss@@ ed on competition level .
long ago , as in the normal sport , lifts are well established in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian market , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is definitely not to use .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ous has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the Professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competent , and many biological and physical reactions that you can find also in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
also , cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console , but also exercise their bodies and respect the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but still problems : &quot; doping is becoming increasingly a subject . &quot;
controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene are missing the structures of the classical sports .
the researchers emphas@@ ises the high integral effect of the e @-@ sport .
the players are international , that &apos;s like a big global family , there is no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
sales of 130 million are expected to rise in three years .
it is little for the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consult@@ ants .
International is already a lot of countries .
major markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as instru@@ c@@ tors , says F@@ rob@@ atic .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first @-@ league clubs are bound to build a E @-@ Sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison of Germany , V@@ f@@ B Board explains R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall in nost@@ al@@ gia , and to clari@@ fy the old times , is no longer sufficient .
it is therefore to preserve the tradition of the association , but to establish the company at the same time at the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says nothing .
&quot; you cannot hold that only when football remains so , as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter , for the lyrics to push for suicide by Conrad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was condemned in June due to the killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal .
she was confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives would ar@@ gue that she suffered as well as Mr Roy in a mental illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , folded with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; the prosec@@ utor said in court .
&quot; they ended his life to make their own better .
she has not taken over responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has not shown a repent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz however said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not find out that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even their cl@@ ergy have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy saying that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day in whom I am not affected the loss of my beloved Son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would like that he is proud of me , and how I am going to go with everything . I try to be with us , despite all my pain that we will be with us for ever , for his sisters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy said that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this one person who has been together with me since the birth of every day , is a pain which I will always be kept for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to put a legal relief case , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime committed to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case referred to national attention when Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ham@@ g yourself , spring of a building , you don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moment of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; All that you must do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
to the few , the Carter def@@ ended , Amanda Knox , who was convicted for murder of their British co @-@ population in Italy , before two years ago was acquitted .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in Los Angeles Times : Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua did not work with the Audi Cup as captain , no co@@ incidence is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern did not ride a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - Extra motivation .
something else was different in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra garment was very small , very small .
but that &apos;s far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer has been to see , he made a hur@@ ried binder on his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner was post@@ pon@@ ed after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the single level could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach couldn &apos;t make myself like that .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants , and just from the holiday , professionals have chosen existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he .
sugar is well distributed to those who want to have a lot to do in the mood .
so who was chosen to enter the h@@ eir of Lah@@ m , a small extra motivation can only be used well .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player to take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was sitting as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right behind , this is his position , the white bin@@ ders on the arm did their rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked as the one that can take the rud@@ der too best in hand .
he gave instructions to guide the un@@ saved tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vid@@ al thus , to over@@ play its missing fitness , Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , that , at the h@@ eck , come out of the performances of the Asia journey ( folding only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver is thus unable to fall negative in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ tri@@ cot .
after all , it worked quite well .
Sü@@ le ran along with K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ ated so@@ vereign .
the emin@@ ently occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ storm often did so hard , and Sü@@ ver was also trying to succeed in the game build a couple of times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave up that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not so , as we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed an extraordinary performance at the debut .
play storage , speed change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
as usual , the world of Bavaria is still for the Latest Rel@@ eases , one saw in connection to the game .
Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but certainly six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i said goodbye to a couple of cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting phr@@ ase : &quot; what is going on , I already noticed .
you just have to win every game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one anymore .

company satisfied with rh@@ einf@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic minister : Economy comm@@ ends She@@ ets Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still a Minister for Economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than one year , where the new Economy Volker She@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak about T V demand from a change in economic policy - and to the same time the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; She@@ er attacks the needs of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt &quot; blocked . &quot;
the biggest swe@@ eping force sees Nat@@ us in Infra@@ structure Policy : the breakdown of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the priority list of the country .
this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , by 2021 the building shall be right .
a role in the plans of the country also appears in Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal highway .
the goal was to take operation in December 2020 , says the Minister of Minister Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) of Trier is a@@ iming at the wine a Rheinland @-@ Pfalz @-@ label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier looks an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is intended for the stand@@ alone master test and 2,500 euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the Master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction be quick facts to create , at the same time , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , the Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier .
until now , 29 jobs have already been occupied by 56 new engineers who are working in the country &apos;s business operations .
the I@@ HK requires more orders to be awarded to external offices .
the CDU faction Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audit@@ ors , the country invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and by 2018 for less than 20 million euros .
in addition , Frank Nat@@ us is still expecting a concept of the country , such as the Sk@@ ill Short@@ ages in the Region .
harvest@@ ing should also be the previous broad@@ band structure in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note 3,4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ dy Internet connections and bur@@ sts .
the former Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits at the Supervisory Board of the wind company Pro Wind .

Audi will change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW @-@ president said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving limits &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and thus , it was based on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced that there are three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to modify its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ its diesel engines , apply as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , installations to neutr@@ alize the neutr@@ alization of exhaust gas vehicles , also take up what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and to ignore any signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation devices that have been tested if a car has been tested , but with normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Audi &apos;s engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is not protected from extra@@ dition and could be submitted to the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations on Volkswagen , after the authorities have been using Audi to handle the emission provisions in Europe , and an inquiry that concentrated on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could have been heavily laden with Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is also proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
the Is@@ ar visitors also included the Is@@ ar visitors a raft at the morning through Munich that has a special message .
whoever moves to Is@@ ar on Saturday , he will see a great raft there between Fl@@ au@@ cher and the Reich@@ enb@@ ach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not a bad raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the building &apos;s reference wants to clari@@ fy .
on the raft you see a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the start of a public@@ ity campaign to app@@ eals to Is@@ ar visitors .
with the slogan &quot; True Love ... &quot; is the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective wilderness .
last summer the raft drove over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a reck@@ less and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ igh@@ n@@ oses and the laughter against suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most widely published cartoon animation , the kno@@ bs of his figures are his trademarks .
with 85 the Argentin@@ ian still records and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he struck among other things as a drawing for congrat@@ ulation .
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded in his breakthrough at the end of the 60 &apos;s breakthrough : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
the artists were always inspired by the artists .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he still sits on the drawing day and still works for almost ten hours a day .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ü@@ sh@@ tiere and watches find its dro@@ l@@ able figures continues to spread worldwide .
he has also been working on a drawing film and a TV series with its figures for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los arbitr@@ ary animal in his drawings - that has a thou@@ sand@@ ths as counter@@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , its figures speak in the 3D movie which should come to the chin @-@ wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script will not be written by him .
that is why he rather sets the TV series , which is how its original drawings , wor@@ t@@ less is produced .
lav@@ ender in Provence is threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is remin@@ is@@ cent of the conditions of Dür@@ re rem@@ inding conditions and because of the diseases over@@ flowing insects , what scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institution CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to the impacts of climate change , which has been much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has effects on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small tin , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it &apos;s a lot on the game .
lav@@ ender oils not only attracts for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very common to perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either lack or weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and slow@@ ing the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of tone and water and the development of sorts , which are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1,200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employee of Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce are normally meeting on Wedn@@ esdays , to check their plans for the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ceas@@ ing drug wars .
but this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children with the office in 2009 which were the goal of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : enemies , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ter to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal muscles .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no ru@@ ptions of violence , and during the whole country , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto moved his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 stood still under attacks and thre@@ ats under the Federal Reserve and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries .
among the latter is her editor and her inspiration of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to be living and journalist in Mexico , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
his absence will be deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , wearing T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or a typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared subjects , trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though , in 2010 , a Son@@ ata Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established to process the cases by journalists , according to the committee on the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murder , which are connected every year with drug traff@@ icking and organized crimes , the mur@@ derer of journalists are rarely committed to court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ted , and even though the terrain is still tra@@ ced .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting has little benefit for discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we know not the reason why know , we di@@ gest all . &quot;
in the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced into him by car and 12 times , probably because of the name of the paper - which is translated with the &quot; T@@ wel@@ f@@ ters river . &quot;
the cap went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely around Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there are practically nothing that silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa had become one of the most bloody battle fields of the country , as ri@@ val fra@@ ctions were fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ al@@ oa each day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of covered , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drugs , which are bigger than many houses for the living .
remember for a minute that there is a condition of &quot; peace &quot; if only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce was broken with the debt that he was not able to protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val @-@ based cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans children .
this release may have sc@@ and@@ alized the children , the crew members bought every copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had the same history to leave the country for its own security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues believed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold for 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter the noise of the smoking problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time , the newspaper reported a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and the turnover and advertising took up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
repor@@ ters loved it , hard @-@ going investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship and the readers were cap@@ tiv@@ ated out of a publication in which they could read stories that no one could treat elsewhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prize for their reporting in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage during the pursu@@ it of the Mexican drug history , wherever it was .
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ al@@ oa &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either you or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was like a port worker , who was generous to hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
now ask them : was his love to routine his destruction ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his death also forced them to ask their own demands about it , how they can do their work best and stay alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like you with their wives , their children , their native shops , their home and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cen@@ sored cover .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , just stay away .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be mo@@ cked ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ al@@ oa , not more - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ ly rou@@ ters , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met to safety training , they were suddenly no mobile phones . days earlier it became known that Spy@@ ware is sold exclusively to governments to monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in a joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who had known the governor themselves as not trusted .
it is months ago , since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain area , where the drug were de fac@@ to under control .
for the week of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has ble@@ ached out on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous bo@@ xer Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending which concentrated on the home town of Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who has been kidn@@ apped , or as it was done , so be careful to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug makers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter travelled from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the gover@@ ning Institu@@ tional Revolution ( pr@@ i ) , which ruled the whole century all the political levels .
several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption due to high @-@ class cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went to a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , readers could have viewed the Kol@@ um@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the murder of journalists , because the staff had become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ oral Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western federal state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing , that it is his .
journalists became stronger throughout the country by taking part in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; in the protests and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to choose journalists and to kill them , because they have said the truth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has since asked that she is again divided from the government , because she is worried that her rage has injured their objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez has repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico had been surrounded by organized crimes committed by government officials and an equivalent society . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug makers , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces involved with organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the Media @-@ W@@ äch@@ ler Group &quot; Artic@@ le@@ 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on police officers and officials .
&quot; in Mexico you die , because you would like to hold the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phone lay beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua according to the murder of MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach &apos;s correspon@@ dents in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the murder of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez has publicly announced the drug box with an inscription on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled from their native states or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is difficult to find work in exile , and they still observe the roads and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to be the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa who had been murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be a poet that the drug traff@@ icking is fri@@ ghtened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight , last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to h@@ um .
a number of shooting shops with rib@@ bed rib@@ bed and security forces near the river Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ ados they released the news on the web site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on cell phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , it did not show them .
under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole Sin@@ al@@ oa , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the same day when Javier was murdered , the intern was asked to send them to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to remove his enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue , even a terri@@ fying .
researchers have found out that the first discover@@ ies of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that she could even determine that his sc@@ aly skin was from red@@ dish brown - and they said they could have had something from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referred to him as &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ red dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ r specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier that lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
his incredibly well @-@ educated condition has researchers to describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mo@@ red plant fres@@ cos is the best @-@ held fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was near the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ en@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something of the surrounding rock out of the place , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it &apos;s slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is reflected in the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved dinosau@@ r specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa der Dinosau@@ riere . &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant e@@ aters , although it is re@@ sembles an arm@@ or and re@@ sembles a changing tank , probably threatened by meat and send dinosau@@ rs .
the highly ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from smoking , used as counter@@ bur@@ ial technology , which is also used as counter@@ att@@ aching , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix himself better in its surroundings and to extend his enemies , experts what it suggests that it is threatened by major dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million year @-@ old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied wild animal and named Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell named after a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours with it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the copy allowed it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , patterns and form of shed and arms over his body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they discovered the contro@@ vers@@ at@@ ation , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , which means the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the counter is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the survi@@ vor@@ s living today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs ch@@ ased out enough pressure through meat e@@ forth dinosau@@ rs , the evolution of the confron@@ tation as a means of survi@@ ving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but most of contemporary animals , who use the counter or belt - think of Re@@ he , Zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and hurt than lo@@ ot , which indicated that this no@@ dos@@ ing was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strong imp@@ anz@@ ee dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs Rau@@ b@@ tiere have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chal@@ k time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was red @-@ brown .
scientists still examine the animal on his life , including his conservative intest@@ ines to find out what it eaten as his last meal .
they believe the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river , and driven into the sea , where he sun@@ k on his back to the sea .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no@@ dos@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with more conservative skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of animal reserve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal still looks like in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you sh@@ iel@@ ded only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ r which stood on two legs , through Earth .
even though the king of them lived with Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of its fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monsters .
the scientists whose latest findings are appearing in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after the death in the sea and m@@ um@@ ified at the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was near the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ en@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum it is the be@@ held dinosau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to th@@ igh .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant e@@ aters was thrown by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater t@@ att@@ ening of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ our in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special copy are so good that the skin is still covered with fet@@ ched tanks along the dinosau@@ rs .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a lot@@ tery in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the conf@@ using it becomes .
resi@@ du@@ ed rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the woo@@ ded tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
fier@@ ce accident on Thursday night on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , long kilomet@@ ers@@ - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , around 20 people were injured in the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
after the first data of the police , against 17.00 hr@@ ams between the connecting places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( county of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were about 30 vehicles , including a lor@@ ry .
the exact number of injuries is not disclos@@ ed at first .
it is a little until moderate injuries , a polic@@ emen said .
a large charge of rescue vehicles was at the accident location .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
in direction of travel in Munich , a ten kilometer long way back formed .
like a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter , it came on the counter @-@ road to massive disability - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched the labels of the vehicle , which now have to calculate with delicate pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was another second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transpor@@ ters and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced it : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the creative and w@@ akes up an un@@ easy or irrit@@ ates the driver in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the create card control .
one simply confirms the mobile phone to be taken and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; if the offer goes , we extend it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the rail@@ ways the ticket classification without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use them , however , some pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what happens already most passengers .
it also has to have bought by train , DB &apos;s navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way ticket for ticket booking .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climb@@ s into the train , calling its ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers then a button on electronic evaluation appears .
the train manager will receive a message on their mobile devices that driving g@@ ast X is located in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train manager is sitting at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already existing online ticket .
so you can go on , continue to keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to relax without ticket control through our train service personnel , check in the DB Navigator just yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB remote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often goes by train knows that next to delay and pas@@ sports the ticket controls are among the greatest doctors .
because often , in any case , one of the passengers do not have any documents that you need for the dev@@ alu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document needed to be explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result are endless discussions between the train manager and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the section or big room and del@@ ays in the control of own tickets and tak@@ ers at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can only use a small number of testing customers to use the new service .
and this also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw@@ numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked yet .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any was sh@@ aken Fer@@ rell to her core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment sat in St. Louis Gr@@ or@@ ate on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll@@ ly by Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police killed just a 18 year old child , and it is still on the street &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was called there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody had posted the information on their feed , they closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from St. Louis was involved in the death of Michael Brown , an in@@ armed black 18 year old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the street and stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was for them and their community nothing new .
she moved your mobile phone to twe@@ ets later on the evening to get twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the cried , and from a man who claimed to be father &apos;s father , who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of prot@@ esters with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she said , a polic@@ eman secured his gun and cried , &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you all . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have used to us and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills frost .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a history of survi@@ ving and the protest , the love and the loss of strength , which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to challenge the answers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter , wearing a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , following F@@ erg@@ us@@ on drove the two a conversation that they had many times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for that , what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do they remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and they will be stopped .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free for ourselves .
even if I have good luck to experience her to experience her experience , she is not unlike the next black female @-@ child .
I have the feeling I would give her a bad service to keep it far away . &quot;
the first station , when it arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which was waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business partner who made lunch .
they provide bags before and helped to pass them to prot@@ esters .
slowly began a new kind of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m changed totally after 9 August , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah &apos;@@ ay@@ an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism has been nur@@ tured by countless cases of people , often from White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices were not cent@@ ered , and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field which is around for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in recent years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we speak , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for so will I be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the target was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but in order to be a community , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the open participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls Life , how she fell in love and married her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that in this work and in favour of black people have to give a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , Fer@@ rel@@ ls history repeated the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who formed the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are fighting with different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must carry the main last of all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ay@@ an agreed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is obvious that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not affir@@ med &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was chosen as a heart of the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person that sh@@ ook her energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a co@@ incidence , although it was in front of the front , because when a life on these cros@@ sings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area they call her home : &quot; a may@@ hem . &quot;
nevertheless she mour@@ ns about vocals , and she feels committed to this memory since three years ago she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the street .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ ahn &quot; : TV reader discuss about Bit @-@ Gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is still not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has collap@@ sed the population of advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold the subject hardly leaves a cold .
the subject is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one @-@ bit gallery will say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be real class &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ ab@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the advoc@@ ates build a gallery more customers in the city , including the rest of the business , fear the opponents , that the pedestrian zone may be bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
added : the gallery will be planned exactly on the grounds , where the farmers market will be able to offer their products .
the construction work will be concluded with the start of construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a @-@ Place with the possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farm market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of land wives are always very happy again .
we discovered the but@@ cher shop for us too .
we would like that , during and especially after building the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this promotion .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; it is a direct market in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the level of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this is likely to be not low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why purchasing a shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ pping or supermarket : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there exists enough in our city .
you can see how many shops can be empty here - some for months and years .
since there is not even a good weekend market , it is the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the product offered is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive .
as you see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies because the rentals are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , there is almost no more and what else is left , will probably disappear as well . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery is not suitable for Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market go down during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on the duration if the bit gallery is actually really coming .
or does it make the g@@ hosts bit @-@ gallery already before , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it &apos;s just not going to work .
and there is no one shopping center that stands empty , no one needs .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ as@@ mark@@ thalle , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaningful construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the pe@@ as@@ antry hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost impossible to hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cut that were sent to you by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the c@@ utt@@ ings from prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st was a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , having publicly called diplomatic messages about the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is called a Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was unified in technology , computer science and art combined , and M@@ anning , a Trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking Dis@@ si@@ dent@@ in , whose convic@@ tion of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which might look like anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as it may be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already been referred to as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , among them six charges against the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison it was op@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ins , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , where M@@ anning always sits on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ inum blonde per@@ gap has been associated with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg arrived just from the great success of their 2012 &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ e@@ facts like cigarette dum@@ b and che@@ wing gum by extracted the DNA from the waste to create a picture of which these people might look like .
this was the time when it received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not visit this time and could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait .
the artist and their imprisoned m@@ use began to un@@ equal letters , which were inter@@ changeable over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she even created a Comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ le Images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which predicted a future in which the president of Chel@@ Over@@ seas would appear and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was in fact only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings was calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas . he was a welcome kind of lucky encounter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a little deeper in the opening of the exhibition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deeper and star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to avoid the rigid divisions , which he actually should fix . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things came from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ anning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written in her family name ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) at the end of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic pur@@ ges , whose basis is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ al of Cs and Gs and As is written in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , showing the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific icon of the artist ) , like aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and as open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , trace Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is stored in one &apos;s own space is a page from the Comic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above .
she shows M@@ anning , as it shows up with a Freis@@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ one in the hand of the discipl@@ ines of the United States such as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they ch@@ ill your words , they have won it , &quot; says it .
&quot; that &apos;s never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , greeting from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ ose down when I speak about it . &quot;
M@@ anning has not yet seen the exhibition yet - as it was supposed to be taken away in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of space of the mas@@ ks created by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ pl@@ ets , like hor@@ des of Protest@@ ers .
that was also targeted as everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it feels like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , like movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a country @-@ wide country @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which had been found as susp@@ ects , after a man had been stab@@ bed to a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 56 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the charges of the Local Court of Cook .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several pins .
a public alert system published by the Chicago police authorities that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim of several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are looking for the two susp@@ ects , they said officials .
L@@ ath@@ em has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em had been excluded in be@@ ati@@ sts and to be excluded from the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter , which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investig@@ ator authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement , added that war@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and they wanted to be .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he requested the susp@@ ect of susp@@ ecting the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea of her dwelling place , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help you find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building fo@@ rested of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which had just a pet@@ alled tip that had happened in the apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it is not clear if the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team from Grand Plaza has published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and investig@@ ates a variety of motives , including a possible h@@ ill@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timet@@ able in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for rest@@ oring Russian anti @-@ doping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a particular stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ doping ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PM commented the second part of the WA@@ DA in accordance with the Code , which describes the criteria for ren@@ dering R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the Website of the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything for Russia to concern himself .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future . &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities approved the reported outcome of the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly accept nation@@ ally sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
in regard to the matter Mut@@ ko : &quot; we conduct the investigation into which our anti @-@ doping system has inserted a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit anything , what does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ at@@ os words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales outlet R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly told that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one has decided to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ on@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 during D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als of WA@@ DA by performing Dop@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA general director Olivier Niger declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di has not sold any eggs more
they shared the corporate groups .
there are a pure improvement , it could not be prec@@ eded by no health imp@@ air@@ ment , it was called in the message .
from now only eggs will be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been tested neg@@ atively at fi@@ able anti @-@ lung cancer .
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency at its customers .
start ups that will help your company , not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the pol@@ ls did not work .
the answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful , or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , a few workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consist@@ ency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is in watch@@ ings to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of staff commitment , it allows companies to contact surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to handle the C @-@ Suite exec@@ u@@ tives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursu@@ it of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with g@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company , which shows most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives have low interest results - so you can ref@@ resh why .
companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber which has been published in sc@@ and@@ als , which describes a former employee a blog post , who have spoken a field of har@@ ass@@ ment , where those who have spoken were punished .
for Start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .
global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , following the financial technical website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ ting , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour , and saw an increasing interest and activity in the midst of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ ting has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ting companies will send custom &quot; powder &quot; pol@@ ls to collect confi@@ dential answers and view the warmth cards of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line using the employees .
and if the main business guide is included , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion covers the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated , or does not have ethnic , it can experience expensive consequences by consumers bo@@ yc@@ ott , workers &quot; fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ ting has been employed for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said it was no good chance to track the complaints of employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the company Conver@@ ting , you can have problems that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or l@@ ur@@ able pract@@ iti@@ oner , identified and addressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience working with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano who guides the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , valu@@ ation and staff involvement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed through the Enron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that firms realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ting offer your software as a service and checks the company with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start@@ ups .
Conver@@ ting received $ 10 million at financing in February of companies such as Sap@@ phire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
P@@ itz@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and delivered its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given by the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inserts .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the people are happy to be in a company , and that the work you do is worthwhile , and then feel stronger to make this business succeed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ ting and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ iten , when its portfolio company run well . companies run well when employees are standing up and engaged .
if the Analytics Tool utilizes third parties , commitment and use of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about staff commitment according to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless , if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have a anticip@@ ation that is change on the way .
and if the change isn &apos;t fast enough , or at all , this cannot be honoured and ende@@ mic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask about 4,000 ideas , you need to be ready to have 4.000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen himself very much on gathering data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Did you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of this ?
and if you don &apos;t care about , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who now runs monthly personnel surveys , was able to transfer measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so save .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize the quality of communication , capable of organizing multiple teams within the company and to add a communications training to tackle the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company has always gained new insights into the staff , and it hopes that in a long term , this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for fra@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tained himself on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ stable minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to its final testing before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a genuine Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ im @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already completed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day in which the brood moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school during the summer school during Mor@@ a six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the name of the N@@ CAA , even if they add a more point to the player &apos;s busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place these huge burden three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it simply expresses it , they pl@@ ushes on them , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we will have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices , once the camp is over , which has been exposed in view of the clear view of its fields and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been cleared with foot@@ balls , which is a protective net behind a fo@@ al fo@@ rest@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brood @-@ players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a cleared that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will deplo@@ y our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people can rent a room there , and then set up a practice to sign up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and exercise of an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t really worry about that too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential news on the fact review of third parties and their results in the original fee , then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machining methods and to send them to fact , possibly results from the fact testing of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom believe they also have affected the US presidential elections in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has become a major political theme in Europe , where the French voters have been floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan based on social media networks , if they do not succeed , c@@ asser@@ t post@@ ings as before the elections there be quickly er@@ adi@@ cated in September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate explanation in German that the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the realisation of the third parties , people want to make more context to make well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , Product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to add its feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and will work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in the Be@@ w@@ l River valley in Kent , and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript from somebody who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says goodbye . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sc@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist , Bri@@ pon@@ y Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des which was based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acts to the thum@@ b print on the page of a letter that was written by a col@@ ag@@ ent in the 1700 @-@ year @-@ old which he worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and letters are still cra@@ w@@ ling to smoke , because then there is a fire place because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as he himself would be .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who lives so with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have seen my welcome greeting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) it seems to be true to be true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ary hy@@ ena on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ scap@@ ed , gar@@ dening and sometimes also with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived in a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent what had said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could mean that land conflicts could be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let &apos;s go all his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to take a wider basis in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebel@@ lion that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly family of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ as@@ antry began in this area and I thought , a insur@@ rection was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jesu@@ it Jesu@@ it seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , shown in the 18th century , portra@@ yed his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was first formed only years later than his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be a bit g@@ aun@@ t , always to pay debts and make money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men dissolved their school@@ ers , having rich old women married - I set it to me as a b@@ unch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise inheritance . &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des in search of other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind , the site of a San@@ at@@ op dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been restored by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ anne in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf env@@ elop@@ ed
with the env@@ elop@@ ing of the 301 years old Mari@@ en@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau from Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team wish to keep the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it is supposed to be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on their yesterday &apos;s website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are the firm belief that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiv@@ eness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the action we go more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other municip@@ alities .
the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the army
each year in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es over pen@@ sion@@ ers and convey@@ ors in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week is also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces a year after Putin &apos;s attempt .
the session took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as earlier , but in the office of the prime minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five vice @-@ presi@@ iers as well as the minister of defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs .
thus the civilians were in the Y@@ AS in the super@@ number .
the government moves to the military the re@@ ins .
chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the commander of the host , the Air Force and the Navy were ab@@ sent .
since the failed coup , Head of Staff Erdogan 169 has fired 326 gener@@ als and Admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army &apos;s ranks , mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdogan as Dra@@ h@@ tz@@ ie@@ me of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly at the coup attempt , this week is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdogan had den@@ ounced the overthrow as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worship gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to complete the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but did Erdogan really handle the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in late February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ titled &quot; Un@@ titled &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general rod , there are concerns of an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which manifest itself among others in the up@@ lift of the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , the whol@@ em@@ esis in the army and the security forces continued .
in the middle of July Erdogan ordered another 73@@ 95 merchant vessels including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed like Erdogan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual men of the country .
three times they put@@ ted on their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan urged the power of military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdogan is targeted specifically to Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who sought after Putin &apos;s attempt to persecution against persecution , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , NATO could not let Nato be cold .
anyway , in the alliance , there are dou@@ bts about the deployment of the Turkish army in doubt .
the leaders and operational skills are weak@@ ened , &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats say .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will be a new US @-@ immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it looks ahead to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for the author@@ isation of vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented Visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and will do billion dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by the USA out@@ comes the way citizens from other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that our economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry of Transport for Renn@@ es of Renn@@ es
over the past few months over the future of racing gra@@ p@@ utt@@ les had been cont@@ ested - now it &apos;s going to be quick .
even before the end of the year , the mar@@ vel@@ ed track will be built on which the tourist bus runs .
to ensure the future of the racing gra@@ p@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the traffic Ministry , the traffic department is scheduled to start in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and order the Ilmenau circuit of Ilmenau , the country has the important connection for tourism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the State Secretary Klaus Sü@@ hl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the track was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country will take 75 percent .
the contract , based on the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will now be fin@@ alised , declared Sü@@ hl .
the Ministry of Transport and Rail as an operator should already agree on technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road@@ map , which are used for vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sü@@ hl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race car will be ordered to be regular on December 2017 .
the racing sti@@ ff shuttle is a popular railway connection between the Ilmenau station and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the past months , during a pilot plant we have been tested if the course of sufficient many people is used to reg@@ ain them in the future .
the route is also highly pe@@ eled in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that in 2017 there will be no more crazy , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take it seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies provide a lot of it , and we will see them much more common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern se@@ clu@@ sion developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone , which feels warm , with aware of human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust its robots according to its beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot about the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still wor@@ r@@ ying as many robots have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which would make a Step@@ ford wife progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern rop@@ ath@@ ering are developed to robots using a silicone cone .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot makes it possible for example to adapt its robots to the properties they look appe@@ aling as for example .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; convey@@ s the impression of pup@@ il and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted as good as possible , &quot; black@@ ish the site of True Compan@@ ion .
this is what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has also her m@@ oods over the day - quite like real people ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this asc@@ ension of sex robots - but not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female properties that goes on a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : sus@@ pic@@ ks ) Far@@ rah is going to get a most troubled one .
on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibration , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , then why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or simply simply a different sex@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their emergence and the increasing refin@@ ement in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most men are of course no sex robots keeping , and while the FR@@ R noted its increasing popularity , however , they remain pro@@ vision@@ ally on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what se@@ duc@@ ed out of the mar@@ g@@ inal areas , can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instru@@ c@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting until the free market gives permission to them .
there is yet a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots occur in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which the White House provides a president to have women being attacked sexually .
the most awesome aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the bond@@ woman &apos; ) are not the graphic images that are dev@@ oured bodies , and the cast eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical re@@ semb@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
her builder want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to the point , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , the robots have no real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
you do not have a medi@@ ation or background history , anything that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of dead submission .
they expressed differently : they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it by 2017 : maid service
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a gra@@ dient of the tr@@ ump era that the policy of political programmes , which have split the US voters as well as families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to cope with the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump .
we stum@@ bled upon all of us to burst our filter bubbles .
the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families have been noticed less .
I will mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ looking poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family to visit me this week in New York .
they rem@@ inded me that unity may have an enemy effect against a common enemy .
in the White House , everyone who knows it , including rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , with whom they fought for decades , suddenly and quite strange at the same side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this brings considerable risks to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Left has strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the ex@@ iting effect of his presidency has power to push us all right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y way that we can no longer be canc@@ eled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is still a fri@@ ghtened long time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appear at once compared to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of crimin@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today I find myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ ari@@ ous version of the dec@@ lining - the dog at the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which looked at the 14 % income tax ( but at least we did not know how his tax return saw ) - which occur in fact a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the New York park , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ ly and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - most dark and the lim@@ iting music medi@@ ates this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disappo@@ int : the views of high buildings become old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the topic pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
but Central Park car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ he can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have been able to rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him a full score , but fortunately no one has asked for this .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the corner of my street is the same , plus the option to pay with a 15 % tip of tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not only lead to slow@@ ing what is actually a neutral exchange , but also put pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation , in which no required is required .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ used , while I tired of my experience , you can submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to hospital with chest pain from prison
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of s@@ lei@@ gh , according to the hospital , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death part .
he killed ste@@ el@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine for 2013 by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der who hid herself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their purpose , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ eal , of which they say , be careful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national prosec@@ utions authority said that they will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is danger that his sentence increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer ans Arnold a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools the four @-@ cl@@ ots from F@@ iers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were put away in the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school management Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ Valley mayor in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen ( E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen ) on Tuesday evening .
as a symbol of the school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes were survey@@ ed by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eag@@ les , who grows in the chicken , but then was released in liberty .
the m@@ lower pe@@ ar carried a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in poultry farm . &quot;
pe@@ asant Arnold found a strange egg , and settled it from his h@@ ens .
instead of a chicken dish a little e@@ agle came out .
but the hope of making him a chicken , the e@@ agle spread its wings on a high mountain , and escaped .
afterwards the classes were three and four in the studies of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ings , the cylinder bore to bet .
the eag@@ les for the integration , MEP Angel@@ ika S@@ itte , said .
the young is different from the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished each quad@@ rant , that he feels in his new school .
it followed thanks to the colleagues to the Kol@@ ding , the former school manager Michael Müller , who continues to start teaching his parents again .
the ch@@ ick @-@ time is over now , said the class Sophia Schumacher .
she only leave her students after two years of classes only very much , because it had been a really great time .
finally , she can rely on the quad@@ rant .
at the end , all students had become a song from summer time and holiday season .
it broke out with the children of great joy .
eight young fans already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ itim@@ ate people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
the same day they were released , while the test is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have the control over the free camp@@ ground and place every one that is found to stay in a place , which is not intended for this purpose .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court may impos@@ e a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
you should improve the emission behavior of cars from the emission price Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europa are in@@ estim@@ ations :
is the new action committed ?
no , the included software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has been arranged by the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced an excellent implementation in the coming months , but does not have any precise date .
Daimler informed us to write any affected .
if any inspection is due , it will be done in their frames .
how long should the conversion waste ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin means .
the hang@@ s of the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the car manufacturers are not acting on the subject of environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
zeit@@ geist could be there to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that there is no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE will be waiting for .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , as S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is fear that .
but just in the regions , where driving is threat@@ ening .
in rural areas there is no imp@@ air@@ ment for older diesel .
the ACE will be av@@ eng@@ ed with a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ am@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ award under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets one of the cov@@ eted awards for the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution on Thursday announced , singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the choreograph@@ er Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) were invited to the schol@@ ars .
awards will be handed over to the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will organize a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding .
the award winners Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series , which is already announced to do the gala in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - and it even bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed , she will take the talk with Tr@@ ump to make her view .
after the former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
among the former winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city lively
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues next year .
the site is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been at the age of 31 .
and the work still makes it great fun , as he talks in the press talks .
he reports varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , the application of the requirements profile was fulfilled .
the city seeks to the next time an architect or construction engineer .
this should be - under the contemp@@ t of regular cancellation periods - even enough time for a development .
since Has@@ lach has func@@ tioned for the administration community as a sub@@ e building authority , the applic@@ ant must proceed appropriate inclu@@ sions .
because this function will definitely retain the city .
if they could not fill it more , citizens would have to drive back to Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the city &apos;s proximity to the city and himself is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker that reported from a good company li@@ ma as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over 30 years in office some significant projects have accumulated , the W@@ acker can look back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about building office and staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ shap@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Dutch parking lot are increased .
the Kin@@ ties between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the st@@ adi@@ ons@@ lau@@ re@@ ation is still the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will only strike at about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciate W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
rock is present for a town@@ master of large playing room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dening could be re@@ acted to many times flexi@@ bly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the old town stands as a ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one eye &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which it fits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ izes the former city builder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , the urban master carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs through my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( underground building ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we look for someone who really identified and remain with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if Roland W@@ acker wants to look at the information of the city of Has@@ lach , a closed degree of studies as a Bachelor , or Bachelor with specialist architecture , should have good knowledge in the fields of building and building automation .
building construction , building planning , building planning , gr@@ en@@ wer@@ age , administration of urban tourism , urban design and municipal gar@@ dening and sub @-@ dening authority including monument protection .
bike mounted on lines : ground track locked
according to police , the un@@ familiar perpet@@ rators have thrown the blue bike from the track track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the pipes .
these were so heavily damaged that the ann@@ ul@@ ing freight campaign had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male ri@@ ght@@ ens and seek them for the night hours .
close to the scene there were a ros@@ ary wheelchair and a bike driver was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is far beyond an Laus@@ bu@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch said to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators would have taken care of themselves in great danger , and at risk of transport .
beside the damage to the locomotive and the delay and the delay and the costs of rail traffic could also come to the perpet@@ rators even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far be out of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages had been fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the railway line could be guided without disability .
there were almost ten persons on Friday morning , two of which consider remote traffic .
they did not fall from freight , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 metres of upper lines had to be exchanged .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to lin@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel diseases )
red meat and chocolate can sound out for your digest@@ ive system as a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the contrary : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of patients with inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000 , causes gast@@ rop@@ es and ble@@ ach , recur@@ ring or bloody fail@@ ures , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .
while the people usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products , researchers at the Washington University , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins to develop immune cells which promote a toler@@ ant col@@ li@@ ant .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immun@@ oh@@ s in the gut are pat@@ ron@@ eous to ensure that they hide harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the body .
cells that are unable to resolve inflamm@@ ation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too far in direction of inflamm@@ ation , it can result in inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , a kind of tolerance towards mice was found in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial @-@ art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and developing a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an mice had in their diet , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an diet toler@@ ates , less flamm@@ able intest@@ inal det@@ ach@@ us if the same system also wir@@ ke people .
the Post@@ doc at Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan under@@ went a kind of imm@@ unity that encour@@ ages the tolerance as it found that a group of study mice had such cells but a different group of the same family who had been separated , but not .
it assumed that the difference to the mice had to do with the mice , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
the mice of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enti@@ ves and were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them failed .
mice were moved in a ster@@ ile environment , so they lack@@ ed a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not have developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria are based on the immune system , researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were growing in a liquid and over@@ laid small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an metabolism known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the mice , the number of such cells decreased by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ onic values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect themselves in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known whether Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells tend to control inflamm@@ ation in the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially , high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ onic values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;

&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks in football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho is launching its start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the independent revealed in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new commit , but it in@@ sist@@ ed that the club had already been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; three of its four @-@ priority new@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four , I thank the association &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , that are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
to the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising .
the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
but the wind turns out : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , he remained with a certain concern with a certain concern for Berlin .
only no stor@@ ks from the party &apos;s headquarters , just no head@@ winds from the federal government - so the most important wish of pol@@ ling .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed dramatically .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with increasing the events in the SPD @-@ ruled country capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were deep v@@ elop@@ es .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against Ko@@ al@@ itions from the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising leader of a Green M@@ EPs has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months prior to the country @-@ election , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ voices majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Leader Michael Kell@@ ner has promp@@ ted the ab@@ dic@@ ular Green Party from El@@ ke T@@ ests to return its mandate .
the super@@ scription of the CDU represents a clear for@@ gery of the par@@ aly@@ er .
El@@ ke T@@ owns must immediately return to her mandate , &quot; said the Federal CEO and election campaign of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ s a SPD campaign , as Friday afternoon , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ ch has reached the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , the SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands out after the CDU of El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CDU out of its own government majority .
it is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what to come next .
the failure started with the unexpected defeat at Saarland &apos;s election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comra@@ des at that time .
after the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it became also - and everything was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ ride , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite breath@@ ed the party smoothly .
the comra@@ des ra@@ ged in the weeks after lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ged .
then when she had just had a new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next blow came .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he has done so much wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz fights for political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of its VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower @-@ Sax@@ onian Prime Minister has already been in criticism .
mi@@ ese conversion values might be added .
nevertheless , or perhaps , because in the past weeks , Weil always tried to set acc@@ ents in the covenant .
comra@@ des of the former mayor of Hanover , to build his power in Berlin , was also not hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz .
they left him , as they promised themselves for the stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , because at the party &apos;s internal ken@@ nel , the low@@ s@@ achsen is basically no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz is not at all .
sometimes , the comra@@ des will ende@@ av@@ our to keep his own ranks closed .
their anger is aimed at the green@@ ery , and here mainly on the ab@@ dic@@ ular par@@ liament@@ ar@@ ier@@ in t@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ cies about the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , CEO of Part@@ eil@@ ing in the SPD @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ al fra@@ ction , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS T@@ v@@ ests is not due to their person as a direct @-@ di@@ dat@@ or , but has been elected by the country list of Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD @-@ German fra@@ ction , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , Stephan Weil passed the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Sax@@ on SPD in the German parliamentary elections , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal car@@ ving thinking of a future CDU de@@ pu@@ ties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or given further additions to the CDU Nieder@@ s@@ achsen .
funding of the City III
who wants to be renovated in the years , can soon get support from the country .
over this inform@@ ated Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of Ste@@ g City development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review to the previously un@@ covered date .
since 1991 it has been working in Emp@@ fingen formation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has still acquired two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation region II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is important to promote also the interior development , and not just new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the information is received by the gover@@ m@@ acy of Karlsruhe , that it will be a san@@ itation area III .
the sum insured 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which would have 500 000 Euro from the country , the remainder of the commune of Emp@@ fingen .
how is a rehabilitation clinic now arise ?
one will continue to investig@@ ate Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
it also plays a role , whether in the planned territory all interest rise to gentle .
if necessary , the borders may then move again .
the Ste@@ g represented at Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cell@@ ars presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in whose framework the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program are the re@@ alisation of internal cities , enh@@ ancing the living and working conditions and maintenance and extension of the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is called per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then be defined as stat@@ ute .
the author@@ isation period for the funding will run until April 1 , 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the inventory was first performed , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a quest@@ ionn@@ aire .
in November or December , the pro@@ positi@@ onal decision should be conducted in November or December , so that next year can be started with the renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that every Commun@@ e does not conduct the prec@@ eded by investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about to rate the urban w@@ ron@@ g@@ ation and decide when san@@ iti@@ zed and what extent will . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will then be included in the book register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to Emp@@ fingen and make a picture of the situation , promised them .
Got@@ zel stressed , a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires to be sent to citizens in the coming weeks until the end of the summer holidays can be completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow quest@@ ionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building bow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which involves the structural condition and the rehabilitation insights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray quest@@ ionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made in size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Blue &quot; Operation &quot; is only to fill if buildings are operated in the building .
however , Got@@ zel showed that a frac@@ tured quest@@ ionn@@ aire did not take a request at the same time .
in addition , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that distribution of funding from the &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ unds Prin@@ ciples &quot; - who first comes first , ste@@ als first .
you can &apos;t reserve any conveyor belts for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; restoration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to get with a hand@@ movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip that he can open his door@@ step , entering his office and even start his car .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , a Consult@@ ant An@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out after medical standard .
the technology re@@ sembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that starts when his hand is at tax .
the estate cost of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that the American production costs in the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers were left to the TIM@@ E Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the President is on board was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and leader of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South La@@ wn , after the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to realize that because there is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commander of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event for its su@@ peri@@ ors , the deputy nav@@ al man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South of July at 7 : 00 in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long remained until the grass was evacu@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , because of the limitation of service , a second team would be needed for return flight .
during the event , the original flight crew was during the event , while security guards remained at the floor during the time on the plane .
from the TIM@@ E available records , the records were not clearly evident , if ultimately a second flight att@@ aching was required .
the Brands Act prohib@@ its federal property to use nation@@ alized property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets indicate that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm the result .
&quot; a question that we introduced was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; he wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; the Deputy Commander answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and was not covered by the Brands Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even the official events have political tones .
at the event , the President gave a violation of the reform of health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to int@@ end the government regulations .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically favorable purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
presi@@ dents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only calls for a Photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump carried out in February a investigation by the president of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states showing the American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Head of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South of La@@ wn to clear the US president in the White House with precise ornam@@ entation sets .
as a Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercises of practice in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the training requirements for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units put an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential supporters . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers have not been presented for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a speaker by Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved with the helicopter to put the helicopter on South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has no bud@@ get@@ ary drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ el@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D supplement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records per unit recorded flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for tax@@ pay@@ ers are based on estimates for the amount of estimates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the acquis@@ itions for Do@@ D does not contain personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the White House , Sean Sp@@ eyer , def@@ ended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these Week of Things which will be produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spider . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have been ti@@ rel@@ essly worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is of course appropriate to emphas@@ ize that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump ended with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn an event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to the representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss opens tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ l@@ end@@ rit@@ te Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite having five games still mak@@ ell@@ ous balance , the leader of the second tennis league will get the sense of reality .
team Director Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has received respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just on the rear positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , especially the imports from the north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even reject shows in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view on Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this will always be difficult for us .
you also need a good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could be Maxim@@ e jan@@ vier .
does it still manages the Ch@@ allenger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ chman did not play the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga in Czech Liber@@ ec Kol@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at his first use in this season .

how America can harm the OMV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t work when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for the sanctions of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his h@@ ast to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ aming against the US advance .
after all , the draft , to pun@@ ish European companies , can help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , investors of the domestic OMV has since co @-@ financed with other European companies to conduct the construction of the Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ eit@@ ing Nord Stream 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dr@@ one is enormous .
nevertheless , it was too early for an assessment of the consequences so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump has to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are ready for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the group could destroy and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

back backward : the city presents 46 kitchen equipment
the city organizes the K@@ ita lunch box again .
with fixed response partners for the children and an order to the team .
in the urban nur@@ series , the clock is turned back .
as of September 1 the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supplies in the municipal child@@ care centre ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy head of the youth aid , is that good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked to the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
the city operates in the area of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last kit@@ ten year 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not only eating children who are looked after 45 hours in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also available in 35 @-@ hour supervision , when children stay till 14 . &quot;
46 Parti@@ al service from 1 September Chef : they war@@ ms the meals supplied , supplement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individual , give food , clean , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are fixed to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ level facilities - decides on the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier to translate ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts for kit@@ esur@@ fing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for that &apos;s why it is : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity was important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - previously the task of the kitchen equipment - will now be carried out by special cleaning personnel .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen equipment - also has the charm of the kitchen performance even the charm , which it applied for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 divisions are newly set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the field of gu@@ ardi@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative , if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , acting leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will serve in the provinces of the provinces . three women can@@ di@@ ct for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be representative and cre@@ dible if women are fully functional and involved in all parts of the election process .

G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vit@@ ie Factory in Glasgow
a union wants to make a union with managers from the Bis@@ c@@ ite producer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie over the long @-@ term commitment to the production in their plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent on the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the work , which makes use of other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he had invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be experienced when their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s offices , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s demanded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that finance for modernis@@ ation of production lines won &apos;t be driven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity on the future needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers are foc@@ uss@@ ed on the local community and large area Glasgow , an important pillar for decent work in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , at the perspective of jobs , Loh@@ ns and prosperity , and in front of the Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of living and the chronic production process , the east@@ erly end of Glasgow urg@@ ently need a prosp@@ ective production of production at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ite in T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland and the company will respond directly to our company , as we will appreciate the ongoing commitment of employees and trade unions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate like all the companies active in a very competitive and uncertain economic climate , and that applies to all of our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . you should change our operations at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warns three years before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the Homepage of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave Paris in her persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after leaving an offer of £ 189 million , but they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has he@@ ats the transit window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than doubled the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season .
after finishing , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the most paid professional sports@@ men in the world . PS@@ G is offering wages of over 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way , just like Ne@@ ym@@ ar forced his way out to the outside of the Catal@@ ans board that the club has always been his best to take care of him from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago from the PS@@ G president before this prosp@@ ect ?
in Manchester City 2014 , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club that wanted to sign up one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried , because they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , we will contact them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign a player to sign up , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have sur@@ passed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G clearly made that they would not allow it to leave from Italy in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ ade Report &quot; Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the reg@@ ens@@ ky domain name report to the abuse of abuse by Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that is the author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report to the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burg Dom@@ en@@ atzen continues to be discuss@@ ing discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ er , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated to publication opposite the German press agency , he ob@@ servatory from the former reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express its deepest regret on its fore@@ ground or their then wrong evaluation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the coverage of violence with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg nobody would doubt that it would be prevented for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obli@@ ging and dam@@ aging deeds &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal for normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Für@@ st@@ in Gloria von Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re looking forward to the church and this is a good fres@@ cos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moreover , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ ws a quite normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one , ready to finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are un@@ fair to use today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the mis@@ use cases , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is often di@@ pped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who was written with R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the findings of the report .
what exactly is in the 440 page report which he submitted by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment Factor Ulrich Weber ?
between 1945 and early 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ ger @-@ cats have been sexually ab@@ used with high pl@@ au@@ ctions &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 domains .
in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; summar@@ izing that by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. were applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially in high Emot@@ ions the punishment for students could also be he@@ fty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , unlike many other acc@@ us@@ ations , many victims were in@@ estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore in many cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , H@@ es@@ emann explains why the final report to the abuse sc@@ andal of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence of violence in shel@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; many students make up his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
secon@@ dly , he also appears as cholesterol and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was not a top performance by the Ö@@ f@@ ist .
how do you see this report as a biograph@@ er ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all therein .
at present , eight pages are dedicated and it is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of health or mit@@ ig@@ ation at the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also , the violence at the Pre @-@ School took place outside of its sphere of action .
one can defend it if they have not taken late or taken first instructions seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was felt by practically all respon@@ dents than - literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent record , descri@@ bing it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as an extremely low @-@ minded teachers , provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ bons and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high Emot@@ ions , which also led to deser@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he did not only give you with chairs and the key@@ chain on the ground , but also made ear@@ ing boys in the hair or ears , he has already been deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to its enti@@ re@@ ation , however , it must be said that such education methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s were widespread , with parents like teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you still know such bre@@ eder methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us born before 1968 .
I also experienced it in a sec@@ ular school , a state school .
compared to what it actually goes in this report , namely the ent@@ om@@ able sexual abuse and the violence at the pre@@ school , are certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one is wonder@@ ing if it was not rather to do with his awareness and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , many media have just pl@@ um@@ bled upon him .
at the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him , still eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , the report describes a lot about the subject of abuse on the Reg@@ ens@@ burger cathedral @-@ cats .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also have any handling or contribut@@ or in relation to sexual abuse on the last report ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entru@@ sted to the cathedral master .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a stressed representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims come from shame .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ en@@ atzen pup@@ il R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ ed student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no event , in which he could have had tim@@ ely findings and the respective perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to accept that it was reck@@ oned to him ... Bu@@ ying an urgent or more clear or more obvious , as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ way , confi@@ denti@@ ality , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report on the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance affected students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus reli@@ eved of each contribut@@ or .
thus , it cannot be accused of being prevented or brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these contra@@ dic@@ tory crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
in the media , a lot of &quot; violence ex@@ ag@@ ings &quot; was to be read by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger cathedral @-@ cats .
the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown into the report &quot; Weg@@ ener . &quot;
do he have to live with this alle@@ g@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that mixed up everything and dist@@ orted to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly a mis@@ use of the report .
there will be clean separately : between the pre@@ school and high school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say , other pre @-@ crimin@@ als .
Moreover , the report deals with inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , i.e. from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductor of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole horri@@ ble exam@@ inations , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers have been obli@@ que and mal@@ ign@@ ited , and took place all at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to be prev@@ ailing .
but with those , Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he got the boys only on his face when they were already at the cathedral @-@ school gymn@@ as@@ ium .
on that was like most witnesses , the theme of &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; tab@@ oo .
it was only happy to be escaped , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different in the cathedral @-@ school gymn@@ as@@ ium ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was discipline in discipline , but not sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims are in@@ estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore in many cases , even positive memories are linked to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going to have a repro@@ ach &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the operations in a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
bel@@ ied Georg R@@ atz@@ inger before the conditions consistently the ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the district gymn@@ as@@ ium that the report was even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that in the pre@@ school , he continues to practice the test sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was already de@@ pressing the risk of neg@@ atively neg@@ atively pres@@ ences .
that was , of course , considered legal clarity as a test bed in Bavaria .
before that she had happened in a law@@ suit , like everyone of us still knows .
it was difficult to estimate him for him , where the suff@@ er@@ ers may be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the allowed limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , but he had always looked aw@@ ful .
that is simply not right .
only in 1980 , the test sentence of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Für@@ st@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed it , it was un@@ fair to use today &apos;s educational standards for that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ ac@@ ron@@ ism &quot; of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , thus the Dan@@ ger to assess the past .
the princess is right now .
but of course , not for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ om@@ in@@ ely in all times , and also not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s children , which is far beyond that .
that &apos;s all completely aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be stopped .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and punishment , so ear@@ nest and ears , they were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then prohibited , it has also kept strictly prohibited .
what picture of his reg@@ atta time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has played in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; ?
was the subject of a penalty in the language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells about his perspective , so the cathedral @-@ cats played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I pray you , no means that he led a strict regim@@ ent there .
but this also has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly be possible to make it possible from which until then rather nation@@ ally well @-@ known Reg@@ ens@@ ky , a real cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ bons alone , you don &apos;t have a big singer and every success in whatever field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at your book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : thanks to the work on the book and in addition , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well and over again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep and heart@@ felt people , of whom you cannot imagine that he could do something in a fly .
I regularly receive , as many former domain cats still , 23 years after his retirement , keep in contact with him regularly , please visit him - he &apos;s almost blind and to treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , he was also strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always was a good , v@@ icious teacher - a strict father , certainly might be - but also a loving resp@@ ect@@ ability that she is still looking up and hon@@ oring them .
and please , once more clearly : all that you have imag@@ ined are gu@@ ardi@@ ans that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad we have overcome this time ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the evil purpose that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report which has just been published , re@@ lie@@ ve him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and no one would probably know Germany outside Bavaria , and probably Germany would probably know the reg@@ ens@@ ky dom@@ inion , finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
