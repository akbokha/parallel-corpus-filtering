<seg id="2">An Irish Anstalt, where to meet young people today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftkapelle, where is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners act the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when land cards are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that, who had to make an exciting way, because the car Navi was taking place a green lawn.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern the State Government, are anything but current - but just very conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is clear, as far as cities and communities across the area of the Munich Merkur has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a flicker which you don't know as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large-picture postcard, documents and municipalities have been selected for more detailed maps, so-called urine leaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was created according to the Bavarian Concentration Council between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and issued a topographic survey of Bayerns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when French troops entered the peace of Lunéville, February 9th, 1801, the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern Map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project further forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian renewal management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional sheet for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling, which is relatively isolated in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was born 21 years after the creation of the map, thus 1877, the district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated in 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "wherever the West park is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: there is a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called" "" "urine" "" "from which the basic tax is derived." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots have no more farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Lower sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 at the Oktoberfests, was actually a meadow, and not a concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the Urpositional sheet you read not only the street names" "" "on the guest dough" "" "or by the hill" "" "At the ventilation" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irish Anstalt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 of the Munich's district Irrenanstalt "At the Auer Lünen."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the facility - that psychiatrist, who is brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and ended up the purchase of the so called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he was prohibited to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who employs an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">First place for 280 patients was extended and extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the county seat in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatry since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now encounter Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex in 1920 and turned him to a hostel with vocational training courses.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is located west of the TSV Munich East, east of Residence from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" has been erected in architectural style on the country of origin of the Irrenanstalt who was destroyed during World War II.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Münch.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombers of the Allies broke down many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a Gruftenelle from the Middle Ages were once taken at the Marienhof, where these days will work and take place on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent Act of Missouri, which makes people difficult to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecuting authorities of the state, causing undisproportionately to minorities, prompted the group to publish the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>

<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist agreements against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the journey through the state, and was taken over by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime.</seg>

<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for residential or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel warning for Texas and Arizona, after the states that immigration laws had agreed to ban people because of immigration laws, which will contribute to the view of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in recent years, stakeholders have used the measure to specific laws and trends within the US.</seg>

<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the shadow project and is glad about the leader funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers had to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>

<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their farm," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were enclosed in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be stopped until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The half over leader was funded by the total cost of 71 500 euros, a quarter established by the village of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers stay 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of Weidezaun.</seg>

<seg id="96">The open area is 35 hectares, the calculated cost of more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump joins the Statue of Liberty now</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans now appreciate those like any other - hence the sorship staged Saddam Hussein's space at Firdos in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"" "Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic fight with Jim Acosta from CNN's proposals on drastic restriction of the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty." ""</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of immigrants and Liberty-imitators would have mixed it if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took their meaning, and especially the importance of it was written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go down a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to which later was added and not part of the Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is absolutely correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "it is about the contemporating words of Lazarus, the only one, in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor:" "" "your mosquitoes, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who longed for, free to breathe freely, / the waste of your rich coasts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh trash" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who used to place their words after her death on the base - knew very well that they had a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the links between French and American republicans by portrayed the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed the meaning: in their poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a completely different name: mother of exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this from right wing this long.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big screwing as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty refused to bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch shall not shine the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh shot here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great magnificant indeed of Lazarus consisted in it to see as it was seen by the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys to the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense of seeing the world from a perspective of people who seek shelter and have a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wanted to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not light up the way, but hatred, which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the road corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butflips - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m circuit while Eilidh Doyle was elected for the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their capitals was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or where they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>

<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle stretch of Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds.</seg>

<seg id="150">"" "the team-capitals says that they are" "" "enormously proud" "" "on the fact that many of their countrymen are not only a team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals." ""</seg>

<seg id="160">Block criticism from Facebook: do not throw up a public office if you can't waste heat from voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from worse media.</seg>

<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "the refraction can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb we will lead as sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Governor Larry Hogan expected to work on how Washington needs to work.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union concludes it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the staff of the Governors dismissed the complaint as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counter action with" "" "Well, and?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it's a guy like Hogan expected.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to join with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons that come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which will be officially designated as a public and of employees who will be paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governors and argued that the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or chambers or water-filled people who vibrate online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And they are just genuine people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments was respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD, was not water-filled, but she asked to break.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other latest news," "" "she wrote in the commentary" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take on the same subject, they are rather discounted as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a big group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the staff of the governors described as "concentrated spam attack" would probably name other "Füry."</seg>

<seg id="190">"" "" "" "it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conductors and to burn and bring to protesters and to silence." ""</seg>

<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a tiled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Joanne Stauber and an mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end, she ordered the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that was to use 12.5 feet high ceilings, which was not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"" "" "" "Refan had to think creatively to solve the task." ""</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>

<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right level for the function up or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored goldfurniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in addition to theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends is a short corridor mirrored to let him longer work.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the reflections feel like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, we mirrored units room for all the bursts and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through perception of a glamorous space, the kitchen can exclude the kitchen, if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing is that it is a Gardenür.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering things went in," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so it is, if you push up the door, very easily glides." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clevering use of space and storage space Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they managed to enlarge the floor area and use high-quality materials, which provide space to its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home," "" "Erfan says." ""</seg>

<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her late father Colin - von Paul has described as "main operator" and the dominating personality in the family of De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial states that this means that Colin's property has valued at $316 million and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope, the boss.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the Chief of Staff of the White House, met his first working day with executive employees, he set up a major problem in president Donald Trumps white House, which he will repair: bad information that will come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told us that information about him should flow - whether on paper or postings, because the president would make better decisions when he would get good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to tame Trump by supervise his media.</seg>

<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if the Trump was upset because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of vacancies," "" "said the former election agent Sam Nunberg in February to POLITICO." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote about the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habits under control, according to six former electoral civil servants, is to ensure that his personal media sum contains a permanent praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habits ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaigns were aware of what we don't know - that trumps tweets could have had more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn something about tweets that has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had created it for a few times, trouble from him, then their efforts have been worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently been able to prevent trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House, which are made up of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by supporting a Trump material, that may possibly help her views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - totally occupied with this story - told in May on the preference of adviser to carry out reasons for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative media cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and to find out where they originate from this." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">"" "exactly that happened at the end of February, when somebody accused a printed copy of a article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet" "" "Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson," "" "accused the source behind a bunch of being at the White House." ""</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banished from Twitter or that he has no concrete evidence, or that he expressed false accusations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and its consultants are still in effect.</seg>

<seg id="1481">In the past weeks, the Panel recorded the work, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" on appeal with the thing confidential.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>

<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to recharge people for hearing under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, CNN already showed pre-invitations to turn around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>

<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something changed because it was in the explanation.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Because of this root, the accusations against Trump had become loud, he intended to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June, in front of a Senate committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.</seg>

<seg id="1527">The broken piston was now part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">Thus it grows further into the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>

<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate below tension and can be broken, if a piece is broken at a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melt from Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea level as they swim in the water, and ice cream so much water as it produces in the melt itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of lowering means that the glacier is directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.</seg>

<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the four-largest Schelfeis in the Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">From the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge to the open ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>

<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers did not return the crash of this gigantic iceberg not to climate change, however, many ice skies of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long line of the Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>

<seg id="1644">It is little for the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-Sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.</seg>
<seg id="1646">International is already a lot of countries.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employee of Weekly Riodoce are normally meeting on Wednesdays, to check their plans for the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unceasing drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children with the office in 2009 which were the goal of an attack with grenades, or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: enemies, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no ruptions of violence, and during the whole country, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto moved his office in December 2012. 589 stood still under attacks and threats under the Federal Reserve and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to be living and journalist in Mexico," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will be deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice". two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or a typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared subjects, trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though, in 2010, a Sonata Federal Prosecutor's Office was established to process the cases by journalists, according to the committee on the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, which are connected every year with drug trafficking and organized crimes, the murderer of journalists are rarely committed to court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforted, and even though the terrain is still traced.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting has little benefit for discussion of security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the reason why know, we digest all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced into him by car and 12 times, probably because of the name of the paper - which is translated with the "Twelfters river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there are practically nothing that silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"" "" "" "since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the most bloody battle fields of the country, as rival fractions were fighting here to fill the vacuum." ""</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa each day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of covered, two-story mausoleums for drugs, which are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a condition of "peace" if only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce was broken with the debt that he was not able to protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>

<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues believed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold for 50 US dollars.</seg>

<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met to safety training, they were suddenly no mobile phones. days earlier it became known that Spyware is sold exclusively to governments to monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle class of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in a joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen, who had known the governor themselves as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain area, where the drug were de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the week of this week Riodoce has bleached out on three main stories.</seg>

<seg id="1887">Reporal Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Office.</seg>

<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies because the rentals are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on the duration if the bit gallery is actually really coming.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes which was based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound out for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the contrary: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes gastropes and bleach, recurring or bloody failures, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the people usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products, researchers at the Washington University, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells which promote a tolerant colliant.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunohs in the gut are patroneous to ensure that they hide harmful microbes that hide in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are unable to resolve inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a kind of tolerance towards mice was found in mice that carry a certain bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"" "Professor Colonna said:" "" "we have a connection between a bacterial-art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and developing a population of cells that promote tolerance." ""</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan mice had in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and one to tryptophan diet tolerates, less flammable intestinal detachus if the same system also wirke people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoc at Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan underwent a kind of immunity that encourages the tolerance as it found that a group of study mice had such cells but a different group of the same family who had been separated, but not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference to the mice had to do with the mice, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were found DNA sequentives and were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them failed.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were moved in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not have developed this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria are based on the immune system, researchers L. reuteri were growing in a liquid and overlaid small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice, the number of such cells decreased by around 50 percent, but when the tryptophonic values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect themselves in our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells tend to control inflammation in the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2889">The regensky domain name report to the abuse of abuse by Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report to the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domenatzen continues to be discussing discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissener, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated to publication opposite the German press agency, he observatory from the former regensburger Bishop Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would like to express its deepest regret on its foreground or their then wrong evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Council" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that in the coverage of violence with" "" "two measure" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "with regard to the grips in Regensburg nobody would doubt that it would be prevented for" "" "obliging and damaging deeds" "", "but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "you're looking forward to the church and this is a good frescos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "Moreover, she pointed out that in her youth," "" "blows a quite normal educational means" "", "to be done with naughty children, as I was one, ready to finish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to use today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the misuse cases, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger is often dipped.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was written with Ratzinger," "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the findings of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440 page report which he submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment Factor Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and early 1990s, a total of 547 Regensger-cats have been sexually abused with high plauctions "victims of overprint, 67 domains.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was working from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "summarizing that by Domenellmeister R. were applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in high Emotions the punishment for students could also be hefty.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "however, unlike many other accusations, many victims were inestimating the general humanity of R." "" "and therefore in many cases, despite violence even positive memories with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report to the abuse scandal of Georg Ratzinger was relieved in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the" "" "Incidents of Violence of violence in shelters" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "many students make up his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">Secondly, he also appears as cholesterol and perfectionist, which was not a top performance by the Öfist.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you see this report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all therein.</seg>
<seg id="2914">At present, eight pages are dedicated and it is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of health or mitigation at the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also, the violence at the Pre-School took place outside of its sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can defend it if they have not taken late or taken first instructions seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "" "was felt by practically all respondents than - literally -" "" "salvation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent record, describing it as a" "" "warm" "", "" "" "competent" "", "" "" "competent" "", "and" "" "competent" "", "and" "" "competent" "", "as an extremely low-minded teachers, provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" "" "always surrounded by grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high Emotions, which also led to deserts.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"" "" "" "that he did not only give you with chairs and the keychain on the ground, but also made earing boys in the hair or ears, he has already been deeply regretted and apologized for years ago." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "to its entireation, however, it must be said that such education methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s were widespread, with parents like teachers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced it in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually goes in this report, namely the entomable sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool, are certainly Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One is wondering if it was not rather to do with his awareness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, many media have just plumbled upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him, still eagerly awaited.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, the report describes a lot about the subject of abuse on the Regensburger cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will also have any handling or contributor in relation to sexual abuse on the last report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the cathedral master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk with my father or my mother," "" "said a stressed representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims come from shame.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domenatzen pupil Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no event, in which he could have had timely findings and the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "I think it... also for really absurd to accept that it was reckoned to him... Buying an urgent or more clear or more obvious, as compared to their parents, internatsway, confidentiality, etc." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report on the very clear result:" "" "that in advance affected students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus relieved of each contributor.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be accused of being prevented or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradictory crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, a lot of "violence exagings" was to be read by the Regensburger cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown into the report "Wegener."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that mixed up everything and distorted to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separately: between the preschool and high school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say, other pre-criminals.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductor of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible examinations, the cases, in which boys of sadistic teachers have been oblique and malignited, and took place all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to be prevailing.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do because he got the boys only on his face when they were already at the cathedral-school gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was like most witnesses, the theme of "Vorschule" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be escaped, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the cathedral-school gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline in discipline, but not sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims are inestimating the general humanity of R." "" "and therefore in many cases, even positive memories are linked to him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">"" "" "" "this is not going to have a reproach" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the operations in a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Belied Georg Ratzinger before the conditions consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the district gymnasium that the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "it shows that in the preschool, he continues to practice the test sentence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">He was already depressing the risk of negatively negatively presences.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, considered legal clarity as a test bed in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that she had happened in a lawsuit, like everyone of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate him for him, where the sufferers may be exaggerated or dramatic and where really the allowed limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, but he had always looked awful.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test sentence of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed it, it was unfair to use today's educational standards for that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Fallacronism" of Anachronism, thus the Danger to assess the past.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right now.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course, not for sexual abuse, which was abominely in all times, and also not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's children, which is far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all completely awful and I'm glad that it will finally be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger for protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and punishment, so earnest and ears, they were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then prohibited, it has also kept strictly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his regatta time Georg Ratzinger has played in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of a penalty in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells about his perspective, so the cathedral-cats played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I pray you, no means that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without these perfectionism, without the unconditional discipline, it would hardly be possible to make it possible from which until then rather nationally well-known Regensky, a real cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, you don't have a big singer and every success in whatever field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger at your book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: thanks to the work on the book and in addition, I experienced Georg Ratzinger really very well and over again as wonderful, humorous, deep and heartfelt people, of whom you cannot imagine that he could do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive, as many former domain cats still, 23 years after his retirement, keep in contact with him regularly, please visit him - he's almost blind and to treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, he was also strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparrows are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, vicious teacher - a strict father, certainly might be - but also a loving respectability that she is still looking up and honoring them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that you have imagined are guardians that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"" "" "" "but it is highly unjust, a man because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make the medial sinner." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2996">It is the evil purpose that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report which has just been published, relieve him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"" "" "" "now it would have acquired a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and no one would probably know Germany outside Bavaria, and probably Germany would probably know the regensky dominion, finally in peace." ""</seg>
