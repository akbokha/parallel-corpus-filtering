Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I always put in drawers .
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview now clearly clearly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be put in drawers , or can be bon@@ ded from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are more schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
at best , the actress brings her time home , front TV with lo@@ ung@@ ed D@@ utt and mexican food , called it in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they bring the question about the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not have been married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is no children &apos;s play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is An@@ ist@@ on as one single mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film runs on the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are visible .
at the end of a Gol@@ ft@@ ur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit of di@@ version with some colleagues at the beach .
for the 58 year old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses rem@@ inded of their fest@@ iv@@ ities , they pursued in the fast Gal@@ lop home at home .
a kilometre at this temp@@ o , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding tour ended up again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he had to lead himself with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t go to photo@@ purposes .
the first time in Aachen , Germany , was the first time in Aachen .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports assistance handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala to the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
at awards , it doesn &apos;t lack the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th lau@@ re@@ ate of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means me much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for athlet@@ ic successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring .
and so he had the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 further outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time multi @-@ mast winner was included in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ real Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , der Ru@@ le Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the jumping rope Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand of all Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion where the Lav@@ azza of Lav@@ azza was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure we invest in infrastructure and the trade agreement T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential competitors are at tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a general , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns about how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton would regul@@ ate the economy to death and regul@@ ate death , he says .
in contrast , he himself would be very different , Tr@@ ump claims .
he will be back mas@@ sively , and he sets out for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies .
Clinton is saying : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes were ex@@ alted for the rich , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in those who are inv@@ ests , Tr@@ ump and Clinton will say nearly equal .
the democratic applic@@ ation@@ in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ rit@@ ical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
in Tr@@ ump , there may be a partial internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are clear .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and re@@ covering the coal production in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate agreement he wants to termin@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton aims to extend the renewable energies with its investment programme and calls : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both countries do not want to isol@@ ate us from international trade - but simply protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should then be paid better , about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger worth .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage is up , then he says he will not be changed .
however , the large discussion of the coming months would likely be more likely to develop the control policy of both camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to re@@ lie@@ ve the economy and the citizens , to boost growth .
his critics hold him before , that the budget deficit would only be even bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least from the rich people to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every fle@@ eing woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who alone flee to life almost already .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby that is at most a year old .
one has put her small son in his arm .
he looked curious with big eyes in the room .
his mother st@@ inks on the tabl@@ et@@ op .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social support in Bavaria , and among others concerned with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the north of the north in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all@@ ot@@ ted women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the decor together with Pro Familia and the assist@@ ants in Munich .
un@@ long it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - but not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persec@@ uted , because torture or death is threat@@ ening or cause their families to send them as a hope of hope to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women , other reasons for escape : &quot; many steal it secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their home country , they have experience with sexual violence , for@@ tified , hon@@ our@@ able , slavery or forced pro@@ st@@ itution .
it continues to drive them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tugs are asking for a bottle of water for a bottle of water , is no r@@ arity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells us .
here too , single women would often be considered inferior to children in refugees .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the residence in the north of Munich are negle@@ cted .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not volunte@@ ered . &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust openly about the living , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they are often not able to help , do more lod@@ gings only for them , requires B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether they would like from a similar project as in Munich , some would answer with No .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are not such a thing in matters of governments .
even in Schw@@ aben , women are not seper@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ cher of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are in some communal floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that has been published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are home separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack privacy , or women , and women will be accommod@@ ated together , can cause violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the washing rooms should be seper@@ ated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women of this protective needs can be felt , you can read the crowds at the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since you have spoken about it , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily create a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : demands for new working class measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deputy Director of the Assist@@ ance Coun@@ cill@@ ors have called to appro@@ ve new workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour measures in their disputes regarding a new treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his entire council to appro@@ ve more working measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that there would be Minister of Minist@@ ers to go to the wor@@ ries about the contract .
assistance and medical students have voted in July on the ref@@ usal of a contract that has been agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members that was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ v@@ ably quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government would have remained stable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the contract had been rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this , the J@@ DC committee voted to complete the proposed new treaty and calls for official negotiations for all your wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee today put a formal application to a special meeting of BM@@ A council , which begins early September to appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disputes ar@@ ous@@ ed that assistant doctors in this year were six times striking , the first foreign fail@@ ures in the history of N@@ HS .
after the election of the BM@@ A assistance , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana was elected to re@@ jection of the agreed contractual conditions , which were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract was beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Minist@@ ers said Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ sider &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure , which ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and an official end of the eight months to pro@@ claim the words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but with Vladimir Putin his Turkish counter@@ player in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of the St. Petersburg Pal@@ grave in the reception , I cannot be able to forbi@@ d that Ankara wants to accept this reconciliation .
there was the set@@ back , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles seemed flu@@ ffy and he didn &apos;t shine warmth , even for its restra@@ ined conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better .
the next day , a paper described that Erdogan would have been bl@@ ur@@ red as if never something sh@@ lim@@ mer would never happen .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s government had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first that he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory statement : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was deser@@ ted .
Putin shared from and accused Ankara , Russia in the back .
this was even bigger , because it was done by a supposed friend .
the Vet@@ ro@@ ar re@@ build is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for a long time , the state @-@ controlled media led a heavy , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed like the Turks would blame for everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on serious inci@@ dents , the acc@@ us@@ ations of executive officials have benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria , who are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was only taking place because Putin received an exc@@ use from the President Erdoğan , who wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a tru@@ ce is obvious .
Erdogan is primarily associated with all the friends that he can get in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat almost his am@@ tes during the last month .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic mot@@ i@@ fs .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights that each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and char@@ ter@@ companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are res@@ umed .
they count on a late season ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week the state television predicted fruit and vegetables once the Turkish farm imports are allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists for long , tomatoes for a long time . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , since it was a weak response to the attemp@@ ted power of power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ longed lot of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the result of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the result of the cool mood is to benefit from the cool mood and decrease Turkey &apos;s relationship to the west . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian President won a bonus in Ankara with security that he asked for the attemp@@ ted coup d &quot; é@@ tat of the elected state organs .
this is well @-@ este@@ emed for Moscow is a self @-@ under@@ stand@@ able , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one as it once described me an analy@@ st &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and can feel badly treated from the West and now dis@@ gu@@ ise it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow was recently announced the role as a peace sti@@ ff@@ lers , but where Russia and Turkey support contra@@ dic@@ tory pages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it might be significant that after almost three hours , both presi@@ dents say on the press conference , they would not even have thrown the subject .
the President of Turkey dict@@ ated it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey ab@@ rup@@ ted the Russian mar@@ tial jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for Scotland &apos;s outside Scotland
according to Chief Executive Officer , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has been dist@@ illed since then , when they had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this time , brand str@@ ate@@ ways &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other consumer financial brands .
they supported the international sport with millions of pounds to Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by up to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she decided to put more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the dec@@ entr@@ alised head office and its stock exchange to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other brands to receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland by : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B is becoming our investor stamp and to the brand which will be busy among our employees , as we now become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand .
I say now that we are not pursu@@ ing a global goals , but local objectives .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own con@@ greg@@ ations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing , and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to become the Bank of brands , for how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make it a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago when we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see lots of changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think that time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori arrives at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction with 3@@ .000@@ ,000 profits at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double in new@@ market that brings him 3@@ .000@@ ,000 gain
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ .000@@ ,000 British profit in New@@ market on Friday .
he bet on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , in his local circuit with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jehoi@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat E@@ dd@@ ry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who had won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too .
I &apos;m very happy that it has happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a real Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he re@@ covers a win on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career law
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , reaching only a few before him .
it has style and is strong , but it &apos;s his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thr@@ illed fans for this sport for years .
I said Frank@@ ie in front of a few weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already brought 6,000 wins if it wasn &apos;t just a weekly and grand piano yod@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has had a winner in GB almost 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the head of the British flat ren@@ dering for two decades .
it was anno@@ ying .
a whole range of major tournament gains , including its famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago , he initially had difficulty when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ duct his two fl@@ aps and to return to its taxation .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier once , that he wants to continue playing at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin mo@@ ist Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s share of confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ ent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin was ordered without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s by his duties as Chairman of the Russian President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been the Deputy chairman since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in Tallinn , Germany , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo in Tokyo .
on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was a log head and leader manager of the government .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support staff and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do you convince the ri@@ di@@ culous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time of one of the closest affili@@ ated Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret services , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin that was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men asser@@ ted that Chief of Staff came back to his own request .
but despite the smile for cameras , there are just a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody currently know that .
but the official alle@@ g@@ ation - that a man who once was promoted to as potential president , wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to big sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks to Putin that are quoted on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in early 2012 to put this very complicated item - you could almost say - compl@@ ain@@ able post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Council ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin went to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people who trusted in most .
once it was accepted that Ivan@@ ov could have been after Putin &apos;s second term of office President of Russia , as a third term Putin could have exp@@ ired against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later .
British Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson , after he proposed producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confron@@ tation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a common opinion his notice .
Gibson , who played the Special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , was ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his cancellation publicly on Thursday .
on the set it came to artistic differentiation and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details about how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agent follow out , will be published according to the statement by ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios presumably at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who played at the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Greg has been working with the series since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood to the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gibson was published in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hop@@ ed to be there until the end , but it won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series , thank you .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .

Queens@@ land Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe now
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of Queens@@ land Cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four ref@@ uses of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 t@@ av@@ g@@ se@@ rop@@ es .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown , the building site , held a visit today and was one of the first to go down from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when construction of Queens@@ land Cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all witnesses of an industrial art of a truly ep@@ ic measure with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which have been used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the cap between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge p@@ cks are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted at its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first clasp represents a considerable milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of pione@@ ering high@@ - and deep @-@ construction represent .
after installation of the last road cover and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north and country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern sugar bridge 700 milli@@ metres to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at a slope of approximately 3 % .
swing because the toler@@ ances , which the team works , were tiny - on each side , it was only a few millimeters .
luckily everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat in the town of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty in security , while their boat was moving from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat came near around and put us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily the strong winds have had the boat with@@ standing out of its range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at one boat without li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal resistance and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , however , these dissolved itself when bo@@ oting the boat from the person lo@@ osed the boat .
someone has laugh@@ ed over these men today .
seriously injured - man st@@ out on his ex @-@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police hur@@ ried yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old didn &apos;t get the keys to get his personal things .
instead of the alcohol using the clothing of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when this came into the apartment , he moved twice to them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at the hand and the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ ar@@ ming subsequently her sister .
together with their lives , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that &apos;s why she went with their lives from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life of the man .
when the two women occupy the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister on the side and took his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ gs &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green include : investors should be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; mobile home &quot; meeting at the next meeting session .
but argument is programmed .
first of all is the question : who should build the favorable apartments actually ?
a rule is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; S &amp; D Group president Christoph Frit@@ mann means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are familiar with the Gre@@ ens , who wants to build urban areas in future , 20 percent of all apartments have to be found as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments can however also be formed in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the major dispute in the town hall is , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors on such surfaces at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing program , which will cost millions , is expected to be financed by inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the Left also wants to have hard@@ ships for investors .
regardless of what Brat@@ mann , then a waste of the situation on the residential market is about .
if the conversion concept is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme is not entirely clear : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new homes should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of other around 1300 affordable housing that will continue to grow in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the scheduled speaker , Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about how to get apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the western town .
solve the problem at one fell sw@@ oop .
because in the western town we are running dead@@ lines .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the homes of homes .
because the number of social houses in the western town is dra@@ stically increased , from the goal of the so @-@ called mixture .
a concentration of social weak in just a few parts will no longer be given .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ates that there will be any movement in the debate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority the CDU must be with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is focused on more building houses for family homes .
but what does not say that a compromise is not yet to be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting trip to health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating , seeing how the world changes .
that teen@@ ager and child go no longer out without going outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time , on screens , was lam@@ b@@ ted in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about to get people from the sofa and become more active .
the time on screen was initially limited to the TV , then restricted to video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
I take it off of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were created for the video games in the 1990s ( later , a drawing series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) were created .
how many phenomena of pop@@ culture decreased the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand to over@@ load the server .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than kids and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smart phones go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are followed by a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the car , and le@@ ap@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , who pursued 35@@ ,000 users , divided the Washington Post to launch the number of people followed within two days after the launch of the game , which exercise every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it simply looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sit on de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances to reduce cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits , which is too long to guide them here .
but the marv@@ ell@@ ous about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , making them fun .
there are thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people close up new friends on hunting .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ metric games that always have to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its char@@ ms and the use is recre@@ ated with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , however , there will be more games that will become a real world of apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites in the real world , and they will help many people in hunting , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .

Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that immune system .

effort@@ less on the bar .

on the whole line brilliant .
and now the Olympic champion finally .
19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ struggle and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver @-@ med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt at the Swe@@ de during the individuals of the women during the Vienna Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ z@@ h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman , who wins a multi @-@ struggle and consoli@@ date the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she broke out in tears , when her final score was shown and her long journey took place in this moment .
this success makes them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought sports to new heights :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es dominated the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Ret@@ ton by her that she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best gymn@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was expected to have a final exam in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her after they each have gold and silver in the individuals of the women during the Arts Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , won
Bil@@ it took the first medal on Tuesday while she was re@@ tire in the farewell party Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a exp@@ ul@@ ent sign .
although Bil@@ es consisted on top of their long journeys to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
a part of its ground exercises - which contain its typical tum@@ bling passport - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , the competition has no longer lost , a winning series , which will stop as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina had light guided through two shi@@ fts , the picture was f@@ avo@@ red .

she again repeated 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig @-@ bal@@ es again - and sat on the ground with 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as her grand@@ parents - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed in Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision that she was once described in her collection book .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went out in a cruci@@ ble of Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man of Mann@@ i , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the American &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; was a lead .
after her exercise , she threw the audience of Kus@@ ad@@ dies , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared desper@@ ately .
what it concerns , so quickly spread out the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the start of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ case shot at the car in the car
according to police reports , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks of Phoenix during a decade during the first mass murder of Phoenix , while listening to the car and heard music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator hum@@ ed eight shots from a hand@@ hum@@ id , while on the passenger side of the car stood and fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police announced that the triple murder did not have been the result of a rob@@ bed , because the attack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took possession of an adult victims .
the polic@@ emen of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to become a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
altogether , in nine months , seven people were killed and two were injured in nine attacks in nine months .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; divided Howard der K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators refused to specify the evidence that they are linked to the conclusion that attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness shared the police , that it was not unusual for her to sit and hear music in a par@@ ked car .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aims at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the mass mur@@ ders .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as glob@@ ular fragments from the engine room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves to sing , toys and naturally his mother .
but as the least of his age , Edmund Mikro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during pregnancy .
when he came home the first time I was my first thought , I did not create that .
I did not create that .
Wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on I did not let me go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s wrong at all - of course , one has left on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund could never recognise them under circumstances and that he may not survive .
some doctors even went so far that they struck him to be institu@@ tional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help of a hel@@ per .
Edmund couldn &apos;t sit until his third year old neither sit still cro@@ chet and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please thought me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are giving him drawing pron@@ unci@@ ation , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not typical sign language -- says she . Edmund invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a multitude of causes : genetic as for Edmund as well as infections with viruses like meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how to influence the lives of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus In@@ test@@ is .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a long time after the progn@@ osis , because I don &apos;t expect someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants , with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it &apos;s getting better .
they know that it will become better for you .

heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding there is cause for rescue in Louisiana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ all and large @-@ area floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency . it will be reck@@ oned throughout the day with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with vast floo@@ ding in extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service had reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards showed that state officials are standing in the standing contact with local authorities and aid to the affected districts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mike Ste@@ ele , one speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , shared the en@@ quiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags .
Ste@@ ele said that the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts of the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas up to Saturday .
the weather service leaves that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall on rain in this area .
in the South of Al@@ ab@@ amas on Friday , a Fl@@ ut@@ early warning system was continued , while the Mobile continued .
the river of Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will be able to reach all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood after the weekend record .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that a down@@ stream floo@@ ded floo@@ ding in the Par@@ ish represents a danger , as it can only flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the river w@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded .
rescue teams still used people from the river Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son fell among those who were saved on Friday in the proximity of Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water is removed from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rising strongly .
he told him another step@@ son who lives near , warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flows and po@@ uring in , &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years , where she lived there , never had such a high level of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and they had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated by Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread &quot; rapidly , &quot; as there was still heavy rainf@@ alls , and that the authorities to take evacu@@ ation transfers into consideration .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , ob@@ server ob@@ servers near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight until Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground is much more balanced on the ground since Wednesday .
the authorities believed that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding inhabitants of their houses were caused by their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ affili@@ ates WW@@ L reported that there were 200 floo@@ ded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were now over@@ floo@@ ded both .
the ruler of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets were saved from floo@@ ding .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were furnished to host the evacu@@ ated people .
&quot; once the water starts to return , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Ham@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood , we hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood that we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency @-@ manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it remained on the Gulf Coast .

Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; thrown by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child will be shot .
the grand@@ parents of the young identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered various shades , including in the lungs , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was with his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was sol@@ dered by balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ o@@ res to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to submit to several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transmitter that it is expected to recover .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two aged 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is located in a critical condition , on the station .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are finding out whether one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators could be found .
investig@@ ators divided the C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently came to a fire fire between several archers .
cartridge sleeves for assault rif@@ le , which were tra@@ ced back to different assault rif@@ le , over@@ se@@ ated the scene .
it seems that it was clearly traded for a pro@@ longed battle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ ways , env@@ elop@@ ed .
here it seems to have been several armed forces involved , which were very actively involved , &quot; shared police ra@@ p Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di , police in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there came no strength and the police are currently reviewed reports according to the CC@@ TV surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross trainer on arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I suggest under the women &apos;s Olympics in the tower and that is more than a reason .
first of all , I &apos;ve been doing so dominant in every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and second , this team has three bands , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who insp@@ ires many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , who is Cath@@ ed@@ kin , is proud of everyone .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
over the past four years , number one was one of A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad in America and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ic@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman , who won gold with an individual case event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but you do not see classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four people in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sport and Turner first line in private gy@@ ms , which are up by parents , which come up for training , introduc@@ tory , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in weal@@ thy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , Turner get their overall training and this is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the tur@@ nes .
we have to be inspired by the con@@ greg@@ ations of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie .
I was founded by my Turn@@ halle for 20 years .
with my events we had free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) were trained and national and international vic@@ tors are trained .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality tur@@ key , which make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
tur@@ nes develops strength , flexibility and coordination of the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school@@ ing and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to interest for the tur@@ nes and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls motiv@@ ates with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ing doctors want to organize further strikes after they refused Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts suggestion
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed Treaty with the function of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 37@@ ,000 Assist@@ enz@@ arians , who vote in a choice , refused to vote against him .
in July , Hunt &apos;s plans were disclos@@ ed to implement the contract , and said that N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land , &quot; if any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients .
the first veter@@ in@@ arians will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of ung@@ la@@ zy times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Committee for Assist@@ enz@@ arians shared last night in a message with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have to heat up serious concerns , especially that it is to treat all doctors to treat all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for only eight weeks , who still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A on the solution of the dispute through talks will participate in the government on the contrary , and sometimes on a de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was done by a talking about Jerem@@ y Hunt just over the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act now to raise the vibration and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot;
if it does not do this , the assistance denti@@ sts are made clear that they are ready to perform further work@@ ings .
the last strike at the end of April saw an increase of nearly 13@@ ,000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 appoint@@ ments , since n@@ urses and specialist denti@@ sts were included in order to cover doctors on the strike post@@ chain cover .
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute via the amend@@ ment to the reform of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to pay a better week@@ day for the 54@@ ,000 Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ arians to be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , asked the Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ arians to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working action takes nothing of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , care and their families only worry , hard@@ ship and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past two months , we have spoken to the com@@ itt@@ ee of the Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ arians and to the health ministry and other minist@@ ries have a positive impact on the wor@@ m@@ acy and the wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hop@@ ed that this continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as post@@ ing , flexibility for training , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - a sign that were seriously the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health , regarding agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day medicine after recommended by the authorities to submit more people for a longer period .
the Algeri@@ an medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for persons with a heart disease .
this medication is administered for a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ating authority has a four years of taking recommended to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular problems .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ating authority has a four years of taking recommended to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular problems .
each year around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of them suffer more heart attack or a stroke .
cardi@@ ac attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by collecting fet@@ al materials in the arter@@ ial volumes to form cover@@ ings .
when the Bel@@ ag breaks , it can cause blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots trig@@ gers , it can flow through blood flow and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who had a heart attack already have a higher risk to have another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely .
the design draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month taking of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Research Center said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack or strike a stroke - often with des@@ aster episodes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and strike attacks in people who had already a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit .
the information on the pot@@ ency and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the management draft recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness , Election The@@ ft in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year on a governmental report due to corruption from the office
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities , as a devast@@ ating government report was evident today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet Director Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es banned the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have no evidence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of Integration and Municipal Government , which is now a nar@@ rative of voters from religious motives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it should be allowed to in@@ ti@@ gh@@ ten the police outside of pol@@ ling Cab@@ ins to protect off voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a reference to themselves in order to prove their identity .
at present , a voters must only call his name and address .
the report proposes , not removable ink on the fingers of a person when they give their vote to prevent someone to choose twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , Sir Eric says .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official parties or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is not only for election , but also shall protect the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial bet@@ ro@@ g@@ ical culture that goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign than in the East of London .
last year , a special selection committee decided that the am@@ using Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be contained in the corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court was that Rah@@ man had denied the religious feelings of his Muslim commun@@ ion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he had denied his critics with ra@@ cial and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rah@@ man is supposed to have &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of a par@@ aly@@ sis when someone cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed themselves in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letters - when the older members of the Muslim commun@@ ion had made pressure on people to choose one of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the guidance of excer@@ pts to prove the identity
in his report it means : &quot; as proof has been appointed to put pressure on the needy members of some ethnic min@@ orities , in particular women and young people , in accordance with the Will of El@@ derly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Leban@@ ese background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that public institutions may have ignored such behaviour according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity regarding the eth@@ nic@@ ation and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean@@ se the system , including the ban that political activ@@ ist , to re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report that is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in consider@@ ations , requires a tough@@ er registration checks to prevent , that the elec@@ toral directory is used to immig@@ ration and social insurance purposes .
options to consider , voters before your choice to ask for your ID .
not to use remote ink on the finger of a person when she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic checks on the nationality of a person make sure they are legitim@@ ate .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
ban , for political activ@@ ist , complete correspondence and env@@ elop@@ es of letters .
the police give the powers to set off the inter@@ locking stations for voting stations .
a bill of law made an indictment for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( census of 1983 ) .
photographer ban in elec@@ toral stations .
requirement that only English must be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensive training of the training , to ensure that employees want to pass through the voters alone in the voting cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric fails over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that no penalty was made after the Tower Ham@@ lets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Intern@@ ship has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , for a lit@@ ig@@ ation of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was in@@ sufficiently known due to a number of reasons - according to the high demands in the criminal process .
he also critic@@ ises the non @-@ effective &quot; abor@@ tion control &quot; of the town halls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is wearing a proud h@@ eir , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conc@@ e@@ aled spread of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities threat@@ ens this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ inist and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be over the French cycling sports@@ man Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot apart from the edge and the band , which has proved an impressive double course of the Du@@ chy of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is far from the only one to give gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger age - at least not if you can don@@ ate the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time of our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s famous times .
the h@@ unter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since childhood .
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ inist on the cycling track record many people on the Internet , like a certain bow of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght out on Twitter , after images , on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the she@@ er got ins@@ an@@ ity in the social media , and gave us to hear that he had already been listening as Leo .
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , except the exception of the facial hairy , &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a ben@@ ign guy , so I think it would be a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between brit@@ ish @-@ jum@@ pers Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with their big , expres@@ sive eyes should go through to the Cuban American singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another half @-@ year comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has a look like heavy eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ on Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sunny skin and bl@@ on@@ des hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that other simil@@ ar@@ ities are also fallen
in the room provided : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes .
other popular verses of Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile that virtually identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alists in Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , big smile that is similar to bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Donalds thought that his microphone is turned off , when he s@@ warming his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald who was brought to the C@@ BS comm@@ ent@@ ators to give more &quot; colour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one could hear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost its connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the cr@@ iti@@ que against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with whom many of them were talking about
Twitter users did not drive back when they heard how un@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like grass look . # attached .
short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live , live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , saying , &quot; We are sorry that the comment was broad@@ cast@@ ed on a swimming performance . &quot;
it was an un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen form@@ ulation , sorry , it is sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC have ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the people at the end of over 90 times in the comments on Twitter
the comment @-@ letter Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology with more than 90 other Twitter channels that had added about the comments by Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed and gave a message .
we regret that these statements were made , and that it was made to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ ze to our spectators on the show and we ap@@ ologi@@ ze to the social media .
to clear one , Byron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not in them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ adequate and un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen form@@ ulation . Byron does what he said is very sorry .
on Thursday , Mac@@ Donald accepted himself in the show and tried his remarks to just@@ ify that it was not his intention that it was not designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to exc@@ use me for the commentary , I ap@@ ologi@@ ze at the C@@ BC Olympic construction , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I listened to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not related to them as person . &quot;
of course no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark compl@@ ains about woman playing in the middle of business sh@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where to see them when a woman retired in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try shelter .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered them as they looked in it , and put them back to the shelf .
they continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried to test her pants before she back to the shelf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she turned back and the shop left without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled her own shr@@ ubs and tro@@ users and tast@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete location to do it - it just stood there , fre@@ ose like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone star@@ ed when she retired from her , she obviously didn &apos;t like her back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they repeated the same with three other sub@@ tro@@ users before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t know anything , and went back and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that someone observed - or about the person who would buy the h@@ osen that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in Kent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how we think that someone would take shelter with home , who had a different person and were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to draw clothes from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate them to go home with a new pair of sign@@ atures to go home and find out that another woman had her and did not wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is going to be aware of our branch office on Tuesday , 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to surround the armed raz@@ ors .
regardless of whether you approach yourself from the front or back , this video will show you turn the sk@@ e@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you turn from behind , you should turn yourself as a first , so you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn out &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sei@@ ze the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
beat him then with his knee in the bar and turn off , while the attack@@ ers turn off pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him .
when attack@@ ers , se@@ am from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , grab the weapon and turn them , so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
store at the same time the weight on the weapon and hit the chest , then turn off the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Miz@@ ra@@ chi Pre@@ pare .
but do remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est , your money if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travelling ender Ian Wright for a guide to his tongue in the most dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex to a serious test by asking some of the most poll@@ uted places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk sh@@ ook his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a ban@@ quet at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a fl@@ ushing kno@@ b of a mig@@ rat@@ ory toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before the le@@ aks of each object he used a Lumin@@ ometer to show oneself and show what he is going on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was filmed in the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought , the rinse kno@@ b of a mig@@ rat@@ ory toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely dis@@ gust@@ ing , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria , as well as its own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he stopped , more than a bad after@@ taste in my mouth .
Mr Wright was known to test the resistance of its intest@@ ines by travelling through the world , and did eat pec@@ uli@@ ar as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations to train stations up to rinse buttons of toilets , the task was defin@@ iti@@ vely placed under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told the movie : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was definitely just in his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial line showed a lumin@@ ous number of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the Lumin@@ omet@@ res of freshly @-@ washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after their Lumin@@ omet@@ res amounted to over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have a less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish producers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced by the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different locations such as the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing that I have smo@@ ked in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I won &apos;t stop here , because it is ec@@ cl@@ onable here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the firm refers to Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which includes both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intest@@ inal bacteria and immune systems .
Vali@@ dation Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to really offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to look at , and at the same time the benefits of pro@@ biotics explains .
we led mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by allowing us to call &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to set them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way in the consumer .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film director , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me lose it so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tast@@ ed some of the things that I had attached to him as the ek@@ y Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all survey@@ ed l@@ actic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products containing l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ing Social Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social home after a delay of £ 50,000 because she had terror@@ ized her neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were viol@@ ently removed from their property , sho@@ cking employees found the property in a ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were p@@ ud@@ ed holes up , wood panels were cleaned up , rub@@ b@@ ish was decorated on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was ador@@ ned to the walls .
the family were settled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation .
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears the apartment is no longer able to repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered as beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police told that the family had joined the family , in@@ ti@@ mi@@ dd@@ les of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive cry , stre@@ et@@ ries and flu@@ kes .
skel@@ eton , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ ci@@ dal behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house which will be demolished under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found .
we have been traded in the property in which drugs were traded in the past .
neighbours therefore said they had to fight it on the road and had to be called by police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ed her and her partner this week , after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to go voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who told their lives to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we can tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now where they are gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it failed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the over@@ grown side of the municipal hospital , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were cast down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it was to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , since a Del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely difficult and her deeds had been horri@@ ble for her neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the assembly , who are bra@@ ised for us and have given us the information provided .
I hope that this development will feel sol@@ ace in some neigh@@ bors , and the message convey@@ s that ant@@ is@@ o@@ ci@@ dal behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ing on the ground .
workers in the house management will now have to land@@ fill directions that surround the house
in 2014 the police led a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as orph@@ ages , Par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash of £ 1,@@ 700 .
skel@@ eton received a fine of money , having found guilty of a drug class B in trading vision .
she claimed that money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 at a car accident .
after being without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that they will del@@ og@@ ate r@@ enter , who do not hold of the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row shared by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , that the Del@@ og@@ ing had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about those who can mind ourselves without self @-@ acc@@ us@@ ations , as well as those who were damaged by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ is@@ o@@ ci@@ al behavior that continue to collabor@@ ate with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like that the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro in panic , when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C of Orion was found on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deeply encounter@@ ed that this is the only way to recognize it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the speaker said that the jet , due to the bad visibility , was slightly lower than usual , however , the air ship@@ ments had to say that the security was at risk of no time at risk .
area fires have destroyed this summer &apos;s parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people came to death on the island of Madeira .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot caused by the standards - strong m@@ ist and bran@@ ded - so deep down what its visibility is limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plane was based on a training flight , where the pilot fisher@@ y had to identify as part of the exercise

Donald Tr@@ ump dreamed of tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of U.S. rep@@ ubli@@ can be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave the weak@@ nesses of his campaign campaign in the rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old in Utah .
a rare moment , usually , in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire had as something concerns , correspon@@ dent as correspon@@ dents .
after spending 16 ri@@ vals within the own rep@@ ubli@@ can camp , the dou@@ bts start to grow in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gu@@ ilt is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his well @-@ known media .
rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ les
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
in June , a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tr@@ ump and his bank@@ rupt@@ cy were sever@@ ed by the demo@@ c@@ rats , Hillary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as he would like to stop the march of tons . &quot; just as I did it so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he doesn &apos;t do anything else than &quot; the truth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the political correc@@ t@@ ness for him is not rich in the end , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump has claimed to paint funds to support his election campaign , he should not present better question@@ ings .

Olympia : triple Sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ effective commission on the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken@@ yan athletes threatened after the second doping affair to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a fraud test in a doping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee divided up an discipl@@ in@@ arian commission to investig@@ ate the case .
a ken@@ ian func@@ tionary proved that the former Sprinter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village had a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this was reported by the Team Managing Director of Ken@@ yan from D@@ oping Control .
the IA@@ AF world association has resear@@ ched the IO@@ C for information about the case to str@@ ingent its own investigation , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make a assessment &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was called in a IA@@ AF . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the doping control station and signed as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample submitted and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ k Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the Ac@@ credit@@ ation of Athl@@ ete , who stood on the list for training control of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters in Beijing .
four days earlier the Ken@@ yan athlet@@ ics delegation Michael Rot@@ i had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he shall be informed of money @-@ minded athletes of his country via upcoming D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly been arrested in Nairobi at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
at IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after a long time .
in the announcement of the IO@@ C more than 2000 doping control controls in front of the Rio Olympics , un@@ usually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the Vis@@ ier .
World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had ex@@ erts a lot of pressure on African country , an anti @-@ doping law and a functioning inspection system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ Start .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose doping control is syn@@ onymous with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the 2015 World Championship in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports , ARD were repeatedly collected that Kenya D@@ oping is easily accessible and there will be a significant ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed it in the Russian athlet@@ ics .
thereby , it could be proven that in this sport type area and system@@ atically ge@@ ant .
Russian athletes have then exp@@ elled from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburg Festival explo@@ res the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical and fulfilled her with the role of Mary a youth room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ el@@ an Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ten Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he is warmer .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a older Lady .
she re@@ members her lovers with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because they are musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she tells her in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it &apos;s smart , of course nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ sembles me very much , my Italian character that I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera dancer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it &apos;s such an honour for us to work with her .
she is an enormous fellow .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ments back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is an necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a joy@@ ous approach to life , this is very important at all !

today , we have had the refugees , then the Pu@@ ertor@@ ies went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as it was then .

in February 2015 , SU@@ LT@@ ANA and two other school girls from East London went to a plane direction Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas family has been told that they got married an ISIS fighters in Syria - and within a few months he was a widow .

Turkey : Kurdish church anticip@@ ates mass @-@ cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t suits and Erdogan is engaged , sits at a packed suitcase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany expects to escape tens of thousands of protection seek@@ ers from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the presi@@ dents Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes in the medium term . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard practices of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass cur@@ ation to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium term , with a few hundred thousand en@@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime is fighting the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had covered a Kurdish flood with penalty , 500,000 Kur@@ ds have over Turkey over the escape .
after the coup , coup would add to sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks .
many will be rest@@ art@@ ed in Europe if they continue to supp@@ ress in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state to take refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group of government accused the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ ite cities .
thus Erdogan Erdogan will increase the exit onto the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were already extinct in the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Staff urged that the federal government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp as Austria &apos;s against Erdogan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in Germany a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdogan critics are taking place .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks would seek asylum in Germany , mainly Kur@@ ds and opposition .
fire marked as a Gü@@ len @-@ supporters killed teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics in professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t suits and Erdogan , sits on a packed caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular clusters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , the Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks asked the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people had been entitled to almost 29 percent of all than as@@ yl@@ ates ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , not people have fled from war , poverty , or perspectives .
asylum application according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , i.e. from the state of government , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where there is blowing ... &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives do not receive anything of the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
2021 , the country code will not return directly at the end of the summer holidays , the sever@@ ance parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
for stupid things are not about : summer holidays , heat and land art struggle - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are convinced by the elec@@ tors are on vacation .
most tourists who are in the country are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , aren &apos;t the locals , so don &apos;t choose the country tag .
there are practical issues : in the holidays , hel@@ pers that hang up posters , fl@@ aps air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , fl@@ aps only by the end .
up to 4 September 2016 , the election and the last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave a campaign just about the people over .
the hot phase when you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister , Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the most powerful party in 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
it will be exciting , like strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing AF@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the partition remains .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 leader , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees one of his posters .
he travels through land , spread out ros@@ es and ch@@ att@@ ing a little with the people , as it was already his legendary wor@@ t@@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , soul has got cold feet and Merkel and gives Merkel the blame for the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rise of the right hand lists , which will probably cost him the beautiful office right now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its nick@@ name data , the Interior Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place for a wrong place .
she was invited by Chancellor Angela Merkel twice . Angela Merkel is in the Nor@@ theast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is no pity to listen to Germany &apos;s from other corners of Germany , Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CDU does not abst@@ ain to the usual election conditions on market areas and shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union also noted that in the country you have stran@@ gled the base , that it must be very strict again to find a wire to the people .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , in the waves of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CDU @-@ elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert , however , is self @-@ extrac@@ ting : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to go where there are blowing , namely where the people are : Dor@@ mit@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and just just under the AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election , the SPD decided yet to win 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent prior to the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , might need to create the leap into the country .
they make a modern virtu@@ e of holiday need a modern virtu@@ e and impos@@ e its election campaign into the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; calls it the president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green choices on track search for local pac@@ ers are among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat by the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ ial lakes and finds it still nice .
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : inn@@ s suffer from blocking
at the speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for the responsibilities of the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all enth@@ r@@ end@@ ous praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty sh@@ ack@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to south during the weekend , until the end of October , everything will be ready .
the opposite will also be praised for the construction work , around if it goes around the accommodation of accommodation cru@@ ises .
since the construction site went on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of the asphalt road was removed and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort .
the citizens are now able to drive on both sides of the fan@@ fare from the B 27 .
the trip through the place seems to be back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the responsibility for the traffic management of Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bachelor &apos;s Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Schl@@ eich@@ ways searched and more to their Nav@@ i as the signs .
what led to some trucks in the areas of living areas .
since the speed limit has not been kept , the community called to ampli@@ fy the parish of M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable excess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who himself had made herself on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been s@@ lit for two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the pace with 77 km / hour in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the building has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that the B 27 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ furb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has led to sales of their sales , everyone who asks , can look through . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however some more and some are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other firms , the renovation has barely follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the car deal@@ ership Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most light drop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also gives a fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most explo@@ ited are the local along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words .
this is already existing .
not only him , but all the hosts have hit &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and R@@ ott@@ weil .
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the net revenue ten@@ ds to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; street con@@ formation had its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to be dismissed by half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , the policy would have been re@@ acted differently .
instead , the President Jörg Schmidt acted on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if it could give a financial compensation , with the note that the guest house benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 now , they also make the dis@@ advantages showing their renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other land@@ circles , where anything was more generous .
in all , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family company has been based here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
other regular guests are now often subject to the complicated transport network less frequently , it can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also elsewhere .
after the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client for the biggest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in its long history .
construction work , which is already brutal .
on behalf of the terrorist attacks in laws it constantly is scre@@ wed .
after the recent attacks , the Minister of Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a big security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Justice at the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are demanding no .
other , further points would initially discussed within the parties .
and I am too di@@ ligent in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as the Minister of Interior , however , be on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time stopped before he presents his conclusions for security in the republic .
but now these are the more extensive .
there is a lot known to be announced , announced , that a new security agency has to take care of the cra@@ cker @-@ encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU specifications for flying gas dates and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is not surprising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt to do with the SPD so far : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to place a symp@@ tom of terrorist groups under penalty and jihadists with double citizenship to the German pass . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dreamed the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he will consider that anyway , and demands nothing , which has no opportunities at the coalition partner .
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have partly in itself : he plans fast @-@ procedure for deportation orders and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees who are targeted specifically into the country should have checked out their smartphone in advance and expos@@ e social media account for a security check @-@ out .
for the asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such that off@@ ences or aband@@ oning their papers , to w@@ ander their identity .
a lot of them is politically and legal .
some also works un@@ balanced and leaves any questions open .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of toler@@ ances for instance , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it cannot be expressed in the speech that the bombing of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
many people have wor@@ ries about security in view of the high number of refugees .
and things , who are deeply involved in people , don &apos;t have to cl@@ an even in election times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the security is great .
and yes , there are pol@@ ling fights .
the Union and the SPD can therefore become increasingly in position on the subject of internal security .
in the past few days there was a high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ n@@ iger argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then concerning a safety @-@ based ideas collection , in which the R@@ ess@@ a@@ ch@@ efs will also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also going to be reconc@@ iled here .
from a return from the double pass , he doesn &apos;t stop .
we have the discussion in Germany .
you newly added , don &apos;t make sense .
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he had constitutional objec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , has to show itself only . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it , which could cause dispute .
however , the SPD is trying to pro@@ filing itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ en@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel only sign@@ alizes some talk of talks and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Volkswagen is still coming through .
despite diesel sales , the delivery numbers rise worldwide .
but not in all markets , it runs round .
in the retri@@ ev@@ ing reaction there is a vort@@ ex about a term .
Volkswagen starts out for deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to gain a plus , despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand was weaker in Western Europe , especially in Western Europe and charged the total sales like that in the D@@ ax not@@ ched company .
worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany sack@@ ed the deliveries to almost a six @-@ st@@ el .
head of head Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann conducted the weaker figures from July , mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it has been made in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to the situation around the tur@@ key attempt in Turkey , I also deb@@ ited the British vote for the exit from the EU , explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the United States , where exhaust gases first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony was further decre@@ asing by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an output of minus 0.9 percent is available to € 3.@@ 37 million .
in January to July , the Chief of Staff Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue a sale of sale from January to July .
at 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at that time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated its software tests .
in Germany alone , Volkswagen calls around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after upgra@@ ding of vehicles it is not possible to cause fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor output .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus arrives after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason are legal fin@@ ities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported Volkswagen to offer its German customers a guarantee for refu@@ eled diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these have confirmed that last Monday VW @-@ Repres@@ ent@@ atives confirmed in the state ministry .
the traffic department has been confirmed that there were this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the editions of my inquiry committee and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies are not accepted , &quot; the Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that no deteri@@ oration takes place in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine capacity after conversion , and all the typ@@ ing of the vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in business circles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen provides the opportunity for example a half year after retro@@ fitting about with a motor damage to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is any other damages to do nothing with the ab@@ ass@@ al sc@@ andal , which depends on any warran@@ ties that it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we use VW the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich austerity in future - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is only 139 customers to park the 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ day money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of a single case and does not see a signal : normal savings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not fear for their savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they need to pay 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of over 100,000 Euros to Gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ time accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he hat@@ s 40 million Euros that could be with@@ drawn from one day on the others and could not be missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me at the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t stop for every million Euros . &quot;
he now give the costs to the caus@@ ation principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to leave the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank , too , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t seen four attacks , I might not even have the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the clients have had understanding and changed to other forms .
only a few emigrated to other banks .
the Co@@ operative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB has significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear to wear is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operational permanently is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian national and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank Al@@ ten@@ burg country had head@@ lines with pen@@ alties for three million euros on in@@ sol@@ es with their sk@@ ate bank branch 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private clients to pay for deposits , and the competition is much too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ ker said that T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is a bit l@@ ush from the property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they beware for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ditions , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; today , no other banks are known to the co@@ operative association of Bavaria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federation of German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ os@@ ums ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich had declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go to negative customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of lawyers to competition . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I would probably ask the camera man to switch the camera for the next part , in which I get up to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I mean by sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Data , probably about the 20 ) sequence , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records .
this record plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not having responded to him ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records when it appeared to buy and buy items which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are from the late &apos; 60s , early &apos; 70s , which appeared as I had 11 or 12 . things , in which I probably was too young to buy them &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is true that those who buy plates are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend time , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my truck .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets at You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have promp@@ ted to buy their old records .
by the convers@@ ations , which I have led , people usually have emp@@ t@@ orious so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it just takes some seconds in a business like Phon@@ ica to detect that record shops offers a soo@@ thing community of equality .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some turn@@ fans feel overcome by the digital world and want to draw back to stability of trusted record levels , of objects , happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ers .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions than a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
it &apos;s like a collector for me so and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff from a panel stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M announced in April that almost 50 % of people who have bought a record last month they haven &apos;t heard .
the pol@@ l also found out that 41 % have a record player who never use them , while 7 % of those who buy one plate , do not own turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while passing through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ lows .
J@@ onny , 42 , who is at Sounds of the Universe ( Data number : three men middle age ) works , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy effect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radio@@ head Schall@@ platte , so that I can put it into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it will definitely happen .
more productive , less musicians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older who only clean@@ se slowly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ opp , dedicated to the records almost a whole floor has an open audience when I &apos;m going to clean . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are couples about 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ agers and women middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ oned Pop instead of experimental jazz @-@ we@@ aned from the speakers - is it good to see such di@@ vers@@ eness among the customers .
none of them looks extremely lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to set if you stand in addition to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs on the business for a few minutes and considered the variety of boards used for sale .
it makes rather a display bum@@ ble@@ bee as a big one .
they don &apos;t deserve a lot , therefore , collecting records no real option , says she .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from any computer or any other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a ad@@ orable si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business which is said that a new generation of turn@@ tables should have inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
as I give the note , I observe the je@@ ans hot@@ line , I observe a group of young teen@@ agers to group about a moment to group pol@@ lu@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter to buy a Cros@@ ley disk player .
on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
no one sees her - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but in view of what every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ os , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also that is the most for luxury objects like plates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they have at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the big number of female collectors and turn@@ tables who exist in reality , stores and in on@@ line@@ for@@ en .
these people work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with security at a stroll through recordings of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they star@@ ing a ga@@ ze of an in@@ conc@@ e@@ worthy , 30 @-@ year old false pres@@ enter , who rises all of the shoulders of middle ages .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees live .
in case of a court hearing this week , the authorities ar@@ gue that the state should be fu@@ elled 72 @-@ provisional shops , in which persons can offer 72 @-@ provisional services , sell , hair@@ dressing services offer or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture ar@@ gue that these places should be torn down because they would not be a parallel economy , which no taxes would be paid , and the risk of fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups share the court that shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the state @-@ supported Association and other groups , not enough foods for growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they led out that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the use of people who operate the 72 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; temporary business transactions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely noc@@ tur@@ nal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a lot more major role than people live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extreme pre@@ valent conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas can offer quiet hits between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places being threatened by the rainf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Cafe of the camp , which is non @-@ profit operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum causes , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the pet@@ ition to preserve the Kids &apos; Cafe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children were a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants valued at more than 9@@ ,000 people in the jungle - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals in the course of summer .

he did not have a explanation for his twel@@ fth twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to be honest , difficult to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Martin actually wanted to fight the title at the time @-@ held World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany Ras@@ er have to set themselves on the next generation speed monitor : in various states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ ier should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for example of falling areas where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police .
for example , to highway construction sites or to a gentle Tem@@ pole , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure with a stationary bl@@ ater for the observ@@ ance of the speed limit .
a lasting mobile structure can , however , be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts five days in continuous measuring mode , the case data is transmitted via modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be captured by several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit as well as transit connections to time , frequency strips and vehicle classes can also be monitored .
the trailer , according to the manufacturer , can move the trailer by car with trailer h@@ itch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order that he is not simply looked at , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels are van@@ ished in the pan@@ ick@@ ed and also van@@ ish foreign trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a built @-@ in alarm system should also protect the bl@@ itzer from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the Vit@@ ronic data in various states and has now been used .
foreign authorities also flash@@ es with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive power at 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came to a stop at the final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle when Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fiji distributed a master class in the handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , desc@@ ending , line racing and raw strength to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the defeat was missed by the non @-@ bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of B@@ ok@@ s , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als at the same day could fall back in the final .
but in this form , Fiji had been defeated a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not be that at least a Br@@ it tomorrow will hang around his neck by his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Che@@ f@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult way behind him .
eight years ago she lost her playing at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this folder will hurt , but progress is amazing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fiji started wonderful and caused the attacks to the GB@@ s of fun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it felt for the Captain Tom Mitchell and Co . an , when the World Series winners were running 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au shr@@ ub in the corner .
after four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hard drives the ball .
a high prec@@ ed@@ ented t@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has not stopped in Fiji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a held a touch down at the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the resur@@ gence and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ dominated by further weak to@@ ck@@ lings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fiji was born in Fiji to play 7 , while GB is still alive .
this is how it is .
GB introduced basic changes to the semi @-@ time by and lock the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Nort@@ on started an experiment for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favor of the sou@@ se@@ a@@ sul@@ ans who plays fans , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not hard to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i t@@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ff pre@@ lu@@ te , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced themselves and GB caught cr@@ ushing defeat in the grass .
early on the days , Fiji had conquered Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK th@@ ron@@ ed South Africa in a scar@@ c@@ lash @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the B@@ ok@@ s in the first half of the front , but Dan Nort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a goal among the post in the second half .
a brilliant late T@@ ack@@ ling from Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ AS@@ IDE team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning Insp@@ ired by fighting with the cancer of the rowing victory
there will be no engine of in@@ al@@ dic gold than in these games , and I want to be called .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 tough h@@ ie@@ ve which enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment on Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa .
even if it was only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ le , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ present as she gave to the second Olympic Games in a row without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports who put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ ter is un@@ aud@@ ited deployment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athlet@@ ics that reflect upon the surface with elegance of s@@ warf , which is not reflected by the type of Tri@@ om@@ p@@ he .
behind each gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to the hel@@ pers , which make the difference and it was no more safe than the coach , who wouldn &apos;t know that day if he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he told he ris@@ ky .
I had bli@@ ster cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do this , he spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a quite bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was fortun@@ ate that he could begin at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , where the break was at a minimum , if this is the correct term at all .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
it begins like that .
rowing is already a challenge , but it makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ fertility of victory went their first thoughts about Williams who had a anno@@ ying morning to talk more than anything else and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who used as a cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Art@@ illery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that is perhaps something extremely , but it is so much . &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much that means how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , hence a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have a better person for a trainer or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even within the last 500 meters , when the teams met for New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot to reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen , &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to have not to be taken away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make something great .
we wanted to make no fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take time out for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that my last race was .
that would have been too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realise that I am a Olympics .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years exemplary for clarity cat@@ ered for
the Managing Director of the Water Association of Water Association , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , will re@@ tire .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small bean drinking water is an example of the great water producer .
some time ago , the original name of the original Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , was the name of some time ago .
little later the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia government settled the purpose .
the work of the ruling group lack@@ ed &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twin association , 28 years as managing director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able water @-@ band association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 15@@ 0,000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 locations and ham@@ let with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
affili@@ ates are the con@@ greg@@ ations of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach .
for further cities and communities , there are water supply contracts .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rem@@ inded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set up in 1985 as a water @-@ wart and was appointed as Managing Director of the purpose association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his jobs have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance activities , the budget estimates , calculation of fees and contributions to Emer@@ gency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new w@@ ells ( 1994 ) , plot purchases in the field of new foun@@ tains ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the reconstruction of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ build of water pipes .
it did not have any problems and we &apos;ve always recorded innovations because water life means and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio , they praised G@@ öl@@ ler faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years away .
he has used himself with plenty of heart blood for his water purpose and he has been living to the water @-@ purpose association as it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago he had to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ ment group to nit@@ rates in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia area .
for this he received very much recognition and praise .
in turn , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller met Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ wart and he was a loyal ball .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view , he distinguished the Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the restructuring of the purpose of the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the pi@@ ping of the high reservoir at the church of Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3rd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be maintained only because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who will appo@@ int Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man died on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on its partner and were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself in us and stated that his partner was shot dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators are on the run , after him will be public@@ ised publicly .
now nationwide , because Sven S. might be on the way by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown burnt and has a gl@@ az@@ ze .
meanwhile , the police published a photo of him .
however , it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile , the man carries a gl@@ az@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still wear the weapon , so the police force .
who Sven S. sees , should call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship &quot; . &quot;
the victim was vintage 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck initially wanted to make any information about the ather@@ sight or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; more , we don &apos;t say , &quot; said a police officer in Lübeck .

the cra@@ cked and energy @-@ ten@@ sive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in milli@@ meter height .
financial intens@@ ities , which the industry from the Ö@@ cost @-@ stream , are threatened by the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains during the liberation from the renewable energy system in the inventory for the so @-@ called self @-@ production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West German general newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producer , the gases from the high oven to generate electricity generation for your own consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the German industry sector , the steel industry now threat@@ ens additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel , the WA@@ Z , told now a basic certificate with the EU Commission for talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager .
only if generators can be replaced in the steel structures , all an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent .
but this will not be collected in the steel industry .
the IG Metall sal@@ uted the unification of Germany with the European Commission on its own current generation .
thus the status quo of the current regulation will be largely established .
special significance took the Gabriel &apos;s successful paint for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel , the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reform the emission rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from surplus capacities and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the situation continues to intensi@@ fy when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers came to the global market in view of the weak@@ est domestic demand in China .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel concerts in price d@@ umping .
during this spring the situation has a bit relaxed .
for a showing in@@ fu@@ ehr@@ ing oil on impor@@ ters , for the other , economic prospects in China have s@@ lit up .
it is un@@ clear , as sustain@@ ably the price rep@@ et@@ ition is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
in last the prices have been stag@@ n@@ ating again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp finally did not want to exclu@@ de some of individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel makers remain c@@ auti@@ ous in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced a total of 3.4 million tons , six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the same year as the economic re@@ unification of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the crowd now went back to the second month .
production has risen by two percent under the previous year since the beginning of the year .
the association expects an increase in order to increase in the coming months in the coming months .
community , mind , health : sing good sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her whole life : as a young girl she was sitting in the school choir , in teaching position , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
in this way , she does something good with her health and mind .
for singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard hack@@ ers from the old senior league league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music , descri@@ bing hack@@ ers .
through the regular gathering , sen@@ iors may establish social contacts and maintain .
because often social and familiar structures in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrange and organise themselves to the others and learn each other - a choir is a very special form of compositions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sing can sing stren@@ uous in the positive sense , hack@@ ers writes .
for the sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
anyone who demands his lung regularly , is not so quickly out of the pu@@ rest in everyday life .
even if it comes to maintain the sound of voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , singing is often a special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour community of the sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher job value , it belonged to the daily life , both in school and in the leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or hearing of songs in older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
in lyrics and particularly melodies , people seem to di@@ min@@ ish themselves at long with@@ standing events .
in case of singing the head becomes a special power , explains L@@ enz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time to focus on your own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just older people who live alone , do not only prac@@ tise on yourself .
another positive aspect is the recognition we drive through singing in chorus , hack@@ ers writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ este@@ em is also growing by the singing in the choir .
to show himself : if I am long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthened .
there are good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent , reveals L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who hears it if a sound is going to talk to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer sen@@ iors have various possibilities , says hack@@ ers .
somebody sings from the acquain@@ t@@ orial circle in a senior ench@@ y@@ ma , it is easy to join .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
who would like to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ ical choir , can turn directly to the church or the church leaders .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bors can ask for the internet .
those who desire to sing should definitely join a choir , betra@@ ys hack@@ ers .
sing along the soul &apos;s good and has something of liberation - that applies to every age .
cats react sensitive as a cat on scre@@ ams of young animals
biolog@@ ists have examined in Hannover where the effect of cat &apos;s animals has grown on adult animals .
as a surprise , the male didn &apos;t let the male cool down - however , they kept themselves in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the ar@@ ra@@ vel of cat &apos;s belly at the che@@ wing of the little ones .
they respond more quickly to ten percent faster by k@@ ittens , which have found themselves in great dist@@ ress such as scientists from the medical University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also respon@@ ds to the calls of k@@ ittens - but always equal .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the ten@@ ds of less and strongly inher@@ ited young are either perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said by MH@@ H .
it is the first authorized study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ ittens was differenti@@ ated with the ur@@ gency of their assistance .
a total of nine adult cats and eight adult males were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a call of little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the litter box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for the other , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger c@@ bi@@ b , which were lifted up in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring re@@ acted on the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned off faster to the loud@@ speakers , when this Call of the very most important k@@ ittens was played .
this ability may be in@@ born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male re@@ acted at all , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in baby @-@ sounds .
there were also some studies that women re@@ acted sensitive to babies , whether they were mothers , or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ sky attack@@ ing the &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a terrorist group .
an important football game takes place once again after the coup attempt in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the patri@@ arch@@ al between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in the suspension of acceptance after the uprising in July , the government adopted everyday life from norm@@ ality should not be affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not apply to those who become suspected of being accused of the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the attempt .
it is also not done before the football .
the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
therefore , in America , the South America lives in the South America to be a member of the terrorist group .
Sü@@ ver should be a supp@@ orter of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
indeed , the condition for 90 days is valid until October , in fact that the life of the Turks had no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ ans .
especially fans of the workers &quot; associations Bes@@ ik@@ tas , traditionally , are not among the friends of the President .
but what is the Gro@@ s of the Turks having dramatic experience in history , is the strict jection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans even agree - no matter whether you beat the heart of Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ic@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ winner &quot; Gala &quot; he will be back again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky .
with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions this year , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first time as a top sc@@ orer of his association with 17 gates and nine templates .
in the final game against Fen@@ app@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ffer .
the paper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; celebrated it : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappo@@ inting season for the record master found a concili@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League distinguished the &quot; lions &quot; also in the Europa League early .
in the south via Li@@ g it was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ sky said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the playing year was better for Master Musi@@ ik@@ tas .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ni@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig laid the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that fans continue to return to the return of the 31 year old .
at the same time , the AC Florence was signed under contract and announced at Bes@@ ic@@ tas , after the attempt to attempt to return to the political situation in the country after his EM vacation .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it only , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club principal F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the g@@ aps would have to be willing to aband@@ on some one @-@ third of his € 7.5 million of estimated annual sal@@ aries : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have yet medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was locked twice because of Dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ run athlet@@ ics sinners can only laugh - they &apos;re fighting in Rio for medals .
the theme of D@@ oping determined the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who compl@@ ained after a doping @-@ lock just before the games had been compl@@ ying with her start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ c@@ il@@ essly thrown out and hat@@ ched .
it was a quir@@ ky scene : with a little smile she was still proud of hall and prov@@ okes with her appearance .
as a firm , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a J@@ ub@@ el@@ tower .
but there are still numerous athletes who go down to the Rio Olympics in spite of D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athlet@@ ics .
he was locked twice because of d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is considered the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and se@@ ven@@ fold world champion in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock after you have been detected the pain of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had a strong head@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion in 2013 and European Championship , have been tested positively on the verb@@ al stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic suffered the wi@@ pe in@@ gest@@ ion and was locked in six months .
the four most extended lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ rit ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positively and imprisoned for 21 months in 2010 .
a remedy on penis enlargement was responsible , praying Mer@@ rit .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m , the fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : probably barely any athl@@ ete , so many medals were subsequently detected afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his championship title from 2005 nine years later , after it was observed with him testosterone doping .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ Tit@@ le 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he recognized the bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 , due to an judgment of the International Court of Justice .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is standing on two of the World Ranking List .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold favorite was first tested in May and still can start in Rio .
when the 29 year old world championships were found on the taking of an forbidden dietary supplement , the lock in the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell and ran on 13 July .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday .
she had suffered ship@@ wreck and had been treated in the hospital , but have already been able to leave this .
her home journey took her in early September .
whether from another explo@@ sions on the holidays island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern towns Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ ab@@ om@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , be still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will stand in permanent contact with local authorities , so whis@@ ky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hu@@ a H@@ in capital , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital , arrived at the Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs .
according to police , a population was killed and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ chman and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning there were again two jumps up , which was killed another man according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the early morning .
when the Det@@ onation was close to the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured as a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , the south @-@ east coast of the country a further bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban staff .
according to the authorities , the spr@@ inkl@@ er went into the air by the authorities of the territory .
last@@ ly , we have requested det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ent@@ ate bear the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said armies of Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ ag@@ ee on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s too early to express yourself to possible motives - but probably do it take care of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , the Thai police stated that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only temporary sab@@ otage that restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , you expect that the bombs were laid by oppos@@ ites of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days the authorities have received secret indications in the south of the country - but they did not have been informed of the exact time and places .
still be un@@ clear , which group st@@ rolling behind the attacks .
the police dra@@ gged their civil servants throughout the country , safety around important government buildings and airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge any tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thail@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason of reason , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its homepage to make the instructions of Thai security agencies .
high security risk ( level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ enn@@ ese and its surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim popul@@ ations , not necessary trips are not required in these provinces .
increased security risk ( Security Council 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday could be a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this dre@@ aming the military major influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs had been an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos while the country is moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military un@@ ta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , holding itself good , the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the military in the extreme south of the country of the country of Muslim rebels .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok there were killed by an attack on a popular Hindu shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody attack on the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the visor of the federal government for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several provincial offices , the constitu@@ encies have also been placed under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Against the Freedom Democratic Basic Order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitu@@ tional Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such are the immigrants of Islamic faith or in the Middle East in an extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Loss of their own Ident@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional objec@@ tors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said that his authority has been closely alig@@ ned with the municip@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it is , &quot; said the constitutional law .
in general , extrem@@ ists try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the char@@ tered Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing trem@@ ists .
that is no num@@ bing advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda is supposed to address the people emotional .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in special ways .
this is dangerous .
last@@ ly , there were reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; to AF@@ D politicians .
and did not tell Ma@@ ate , he did not find knowledge .
for the Constitu@@ tional protection , possible contacts of this type is only relevant from a point of point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the AF@@ D - by certain persons , the extrem@@ ist , its target device changes and is extremely extrem@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is crucial if such people have to control the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a view of the clear increase of legitim@@ ate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights in this context .
but we &apos;ve found in recent years that there can be legitim@@ ate structures .
there were the &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday Group .
it may well be that further just@@ ification groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee animals or attacks from other right @-@ right @-@ wing designs .
but a wide @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal gu@@ er@@ ror@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the existing groups were created on the regional plane or in social networks .
concerned , however , did eat that many gri@@ ps have walked to the account of people who had not come into appearance before the right scene .
that is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the Tat@@ susp@@ icious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed an off@@ ences , who had not left a hat before with right @-@ wing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which may have been politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or left wing , which have then radic@@ alizing themselves through right @-@ wing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te Bec@@ omes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the news lines or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the lightweight s@@ wimm@@ ers we@@ dge from Ethiopia is so slow that he wasn &apos;t able to see more in the TV pictures .
he simply van@@ ished - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ it then became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old has ended its predecessor and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 seconds .
but it was rather his not sporty figure , which attracted the attention of international media .
why does the 24 year old still participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ merged countries well known .
since in Et@@ th@@ op@@ ias most athletes run , Hab@@ it just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first sur@@ names made the round quickly .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welfare state &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Freist@@ il there played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also pulled .
the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was syn@@ onymous with media attention during the 2000 Olympics in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ant of the Ae@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea as he had to compete in a c@@ asserole over 100 meters of Freestyle alone .
f@@ ren@@ etic was diagnosed with m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i back then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim at least eight months prior to Olympia , and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

next post is entered in trade with electric van
an electrical @-@ feed car of Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the car is obviously great .
the mail plans to sell its electric vehicle scooter too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly , the Group wants to start trading with the transporter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mail wants to offer their electric transporter , from the coming year , also to the free car market . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I can imagine that we surround the complete fleet .

Gf@@ K management steps to disappo@@ inting business numbers
the consumer research company Gf@@ K is conducting his boss Matthias Hartmann .
the set@@ backs suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult position of the Gf@@ K market research company announced that the chair of Head of Head of Matthias Hartmann became the more uncertain , the longer lasting successes by him .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again disappo@@ inting business figures and the re@@ sign@@ ation of the company , the global number Five of the branch is facing a staff member .
Gf@@ K &apos;s executive board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Arno grinding has already been eliminated from the Supervisory Board effective 12 September .
as of September 1 , the management board of the executive board of Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger already appointed Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger as of September 1 , leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he will officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executive board &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hartmann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business alignment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details wanted to call a corporate spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will in future become the market research company le@@ ite , be still un@@ clear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ m , it was on Friday , at the shareholders &quot; last , the dis@@ appointment over the continuing success of the years ago were largely re@@ structured .
Mr. Hartmann has been at the Gf@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are still not visible even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the most recently bad Gf@@ K business in each participant will eventually become in@@ cal@@ m@@ ly .
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , it would be the Qu@@ and@@ ts as well , &quot; it was .
the company had failed to stop its losses in the preceding quarter in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , turnover increased by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros increased by 3.4 percent for the first half of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; profit in the second quarter results above all of the expected value of the company due to its difficult economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Consumer Experience division , the company posted an annual loss of 139 million euros by the Group , a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .

accidents - Bus sli@@ cks in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ns in dit@@ ch : eight injured
the accident of a travel coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers have been injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( County Aur@@ i ) on Thursday .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injury , the police shared with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their details , had to devi@@ ate to the opposite direction of trucks that took part in the opposite direction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bus came off right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , persons could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the un@@ last traveler were brought back by a Lin@@ i@@ enb@@ us back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement parts of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the load @-@ driver and potential witnesses to sign up at the police .
the fee per cubic meter will be from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World Bank 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lind@@ enberg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf the se@@ wage fee will then be increased again , if appropriate improvements will be necessary .
after a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found in the approval of the budget by land@@ scap@@ er and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these w@@ ast@@ e@@ water systems .
the casino market is committed due to legal foundations to operate the facilities free of charge .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from the world of space , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lind@@ enberg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , will have to attack the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the panel , a new calculation of charges for waste water systems was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and sub@@ missions from the previous calendar period are to be compens@@ ated .
the magni@@ fied prayer increases was based on all three san@@ itation facilities by a relatively small se@@ wer@@ age , with a very low se@@ wer@@ age , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenditure for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would affect them .
in addition , the se@@ wage freeze is slightly dec@@ lining in all three systems .
in the past calendar period , all three systems not least have fallen into a considerable extent due to their age of rehabilitation and repair service .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for World Bank , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt reported that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage caused by the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf .
after nearly 20 years old conveyor belts had to be over@@ hau@@ led and after almost 20 years , the sl@@ ump cap had to be over@@ hau@@ led and placed an additional ventilation option in order to ensure the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs which are to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were significantly below the previous calculation during the previous years of 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stein@@ häuser made clear that at the low se@@ wage fall in the three plants the expenditure for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt has spar@@ ed the market community of great entertainment costs over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain pre@@ valent according to Stein@@ häuser &apos;s view@@ point , especially the supply area of the waste @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al should not be extended because it is about de@@ fied facilities .

take Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its filter tool , snap@@ shots enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already adjacent to the sur@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ ri@@ ver@@ ted , sel@@ fish@@ able tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced Sel@@ fies per day .
all patches are to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have gone on in the past criticism in which they were accused of making the app Black@@ face promoted or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week had struck a filter , which gave them mud , false teeth and ra@@ cked che@@ eks , some critics found a ra@@ cial car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeated controversi@@ es relate to a greater problem , that the company has diversity .
the news and the in@@ dig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been de@@ activated .
the company was an exc@@ use : the filter has been an homage to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ sider that have experienced Rass@@ is@@ sm@@ us , the filter remin@@ is@@ cent of vulner@@ able c@@ lich@@ és .
other refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely used over the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viol@@ ate and gl@@ inde was un@@ pleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the oppos@@ ing of a very conflic@@ ting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not secure , but that the yel@@ lowing was pulled into ab@@ rupt extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American culture seems involved in an endless diversity and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in the hand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience young people - who are in terms of bre@@ aches various than their older counter@@ f@@ ists - could rather expect to expect lower@@ ing sen@@ sibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering is a picture that is ins@@ ulting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is much more difficult to remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu , on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to er@@ ase their Snap@@ chat account , and others must do the same .
in a call for medium and in a phone interview , she said that ra@@ cial @-@ related controversi@@ es would have a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the big part white , only male leaders and ended their attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either have she no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors , which work there , but not in positions which they feel safe or feel good to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat has left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any figures for diversity of employees and points to its status as private companies .
on Thursday , take Snap@@ chat online to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently had a staff responsible entity focusing on sub@@ divisions and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said that she will be shut down her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military Appro@@ ach ISIS Secret Services , Pres@@ ent Committee of Con@@ gres@@ ses
in order to draw up an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it permits the actual conditions in the place to sign the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Association , Secret Service Committee and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ites , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Secret service anal@@ ysts , reported how they did change their in@@ estim@@ ations in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mess@@ aging information that typically were typically selected by the US Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ uren , recorded a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it permits and were consistent as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable to our soldiers , when bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cent@@ Com &apos;s management error range up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed @-@ lasting problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government tips have given under Obama &apos;s instructions , it shows how anal@@ ysts saw the pressure from their pre@@ laws , an optimal picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before the Congress was clearly positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , a Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s had already begun in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the Islamic State control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ubli@@ can Congress , Kansas , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command changes the noc@@ tur@@ nal reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after they played , anal@@ ysts concerned about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defense Department .
Democratic members of the news service ees published their own findings , which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a moder@@ ately limited process for the creation of recre@@ ational in@@ estim@@ ations to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest level of democracy in the Kom@@ itt@@ ee , Member of the Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of noc@@ tur@@ nal reports &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was damaged by the mor@@ als under the anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats agreed to have found no indications at the White House in the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results from the con@@ gres@@ ses were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times of investigations were reported by the Pentagon &apos;s general spec@@ tor , which were recorded according to Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st .
according to Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , announced that the Department of Defence would not comment on con@@ gres@@ ses during the investigation of the General Council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ ver@@ sible opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the acc@@ us@@ ations of the last year , however , led to the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for hon@@ our@@ ing military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State remind us of over ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a writer passing by George W. Bush to contrary to the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts only a small occup@@ ying troops in Iraq , and had a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thought .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team asked Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to speci@@ fying government agencies , that contrary to the statements of the government , did not have significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this provisional refin@@ eries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times posted in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ative because of its over@@ moder@@ ately positive assessment of the war in a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA attract fourth match in the field of women , a show@@ down with Britain .
one day after they shot three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their doors in memory .
however , she knows , however , the American women lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equivalent to the British in their first place that remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will join on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two in their group will take place in six teams in the first and second place .
the first placed will take a little bit longer out of the way that the other group will guide .
as always the game will go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex by their success story , four years after the last London Games were landing at the last 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey tennis ra@@ cket ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 in which she and her team went wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of National Team , and thus began to turn things to better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a culture change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work level in London that we have now .
we have s@@ nat@@ ched the rud@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ wards in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the se@@ am area .
India had gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed up surprisingly , and held the play from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left f@@ lange , moved to the middle and lu@@ p the ball in the gate to pro@@ cure the US a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the Tor@@ keeper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but as good will depend on Saturday &apos;s outcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and inev@@ itable , a law@@ less relay runs between competition and stre@@ bs .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which will protect the swimming pool from the bracel@@ ets for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to a newspaper in the queu@@ e in the Coff@@ es@@ hop without talking about Simone Bil@@ it , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time with the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dim@@ pl@@ ets , would definitely have been sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ free advertising , if it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the Olympic trampoline around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate each event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always swim in the chest , and may reign for it long .
but if I would like to make arguments for my particular favorites , then leave the attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the tr@@ amp jump already since 2000 an Olympic event , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became the last 16 years so much that I had asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympic sports .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the U.S. athletes sent for competition , it has never gained a medal at a trampoline and has had an athl@@ ete until 2012 has made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping on a certain lateral side , partly because it sounds for the un@@ en@@ lighten@@ ed ear for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as those that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a survi@@ ving enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ oon@@ around of his never wanted s@@ wollen re@@ plac@@ ements - but also the gra@@ zie of gym and diving , which combines two sports , which basically combines it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ real and Sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet .
they are assessed according to official Olympics , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ ons must go on to gold further , faster , upwards and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes go and back , upwards and down@@ wards at the playground .
they do not ch@@ ase the finish line or the original text , but also in the television broadcast another cave : the world or the Olympic lord .
the goal of stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic , and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I think about looking at this games as something we@@ ar@@ ingly .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the objective .
he or she pr@@ un@@ es , seem@@ ingly heavy as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ ward , then back to the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the destination , no dit@@ ches in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant adv@@ ancement of time and gravity .
it &apos;s so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualifying and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a post block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably will probably over@@ look over in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Ang@@ pro@@ sy and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey decided to meet his new fan base after the end of the Wall Street Journal .
&quot; a generation of Protestant &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is a allies of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that dirty meetings during clas@@ hes were killed during clas@@ hes with police .
is Ethiopia ready to break ?
in the past ten years , there was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid allies of West Africa with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ aken the country and extended in more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights , the response of the government was merciful .
witnesses accused that polic@@ emen were shot and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about protests , probably from the last or early of this year , show how safety people strike young people with sho@@ cks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an incoming investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and will even be more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services cooperate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pin train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia had everything else as a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the op@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , which dis@@ si@@ dents have been effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , driven or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you under@@ side people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said J@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth are protest@@ ing .
a generation was protest@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use until spice with regards to the gover@@ ning coalition .
following a vast election of last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the ten@@ sions climb along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for these tender , controversial line required in June hundreds of lives .
anal@@ ysts agree that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ gli@@ des , who were more or less forced in recent years , could use the turbul@@ ence and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter feeling after years of age accum@@ ulate under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap smartphones were more common and improved the Internet services improved .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , so many people can still communicate over the Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies , hide it , where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians asked that they were gathered for protests against protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ nic@@ ation in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since Equ@@ al prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who from Ae@@ oli@@ an are predominantly of Christian high@@ lands , in politics and the economy , while they explo@@ ited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and in flat areas .
but this is just changing .
&quot; we are involved to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the major protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and they are dominant in the military , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
according to his death , Mr. Mel@@ es , a former military leader , was the Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death for 17 years .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct that he was particularly toxic to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
analy@@ st tell that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear , that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had been a rebel@@ lion in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ing against the government and stolen from the government .
during the following Raz@@ ors many Protest@@ ants were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and those days of un@@ rest was over quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning , as well as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in the poverty control .
but obviously this does not prevent the intention of the internal iniquity of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , Protest@@ ants in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , headed by Tig@@ ray , and the hate against the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analy@@ st say that the protests against the US and other Western allies are bringing into an independent position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for dig@@ ging flights over the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , although they recently changed this base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to collapse the ally in an already vol@@ atile region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin walking event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declared his claim to ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disper@@ se the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday , that his multi @-@ repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication designed new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and under@@ stand@@ able to the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his meetings , which make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in the appropri@@ ations , which he could not meant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he had made the announcement of a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump turned back to the claim on Thursday and consisted of interviews that he really did not int@@ end to vote , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was simply sar@@ cop@@ ic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews he meant the debt completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wished to we@@ aken the testimony , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism was desc@@ ending to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to focus on the focus of his campaign due to falling circul@@ ations on economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the business situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again to this issue .
he warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes , and that he found her speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July he with@@ drew strong criticism of himself when he thought the Russians should leave Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but he said later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cop@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans , as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s smart enough to keep his testim@@ oni@@ als enough , so they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the clay for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an additional sound , as its conversion had further declined .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was published on Friday , showed a tour with a big lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ head in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his prov@@ ok@@ ing asser@@ tions , he often accused His critics to dis@@ fra@@ il or understand his testimony .
but while he intensi@@ fied in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze his loyal fellow @-@ stre@@ w@@ ns into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent inter@@ speaking , gave herself great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true that Obama was almost unknown in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back but@@ chers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled down the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ ream Republi@@ can try to ar@@ gue that the government was under Obama , when Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister , ISIS allowed to spread ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and worshipped them to be bi@@ ased on any of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats ro@@ asted about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use only another proof that he was not suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .
once passed by the price of the market , café is coming back in green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ itty café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people as last loss in a opposite city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if New York change is change , it is also re@@ shap@@ ing .
a re @-@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened in green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
verb used the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sauté onions .
there are natural trunk .
the café offers no beer more , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez told that he noticed a steep stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed out by awards from William@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg earlier and visited the verb regularly .
even after they moved to green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb closed , she gave a while the coffee maker , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that there was coffee and culture in the verb , which I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks a coffee again , even if they be@@ held a bl@@ ended cha@@ i tea instead of its usual iced coffee maker , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and turned aside to be the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch @-@ watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes it changes its Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he had no group@@ ing that the soap business has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie would like to produce a special soap for bre@@ ach with the cold spray coffee of caf@@ és as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez men@@ ue announ@@ cing them soon to make them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill and sell the cold spray coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favourites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground , when the café was closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the coming of the Lok@@ as and the aspir@@ ation felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took up his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gour@@ mets , President Roosevelt was a F@@ ai@@ ble for ingen@@ ious delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as dessert a pl@@ um@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; Jane Z@@ ett@@ man said .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans that should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both of the food historian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks in their book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ating the history of American cuisine during Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a virgin olive oil with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
as the repor@@ ter spot@@ ted hack@@ ed , this was suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said bricks .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient , and a little con@@ spir@@ ited to access the ingredient .
imagine so many pean@@ uts may eat that they serve them as dinner .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they were the Americans sent to hungry Europeans during the first world war , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the roads with which the country went with it , not to be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time to have a central theme in food for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ z : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ len were discovered to basic food , the c@@ asserole dish as &quot; wonderful way , food resi@@ du@@ es , &quot; noted bra@@ ck@@ man , because ba@@ che un@@ appet@@ izing ingredients could hide under an incre@@ ment sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry ob@@ st .
meat , for years , was the center of the American kitchen , was too rare serv@@ iced luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar mixtures were tried out , as a cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction was prec@@ e@@ dence over taste or even healthy food .
during her research , which also includes recipes , bricks made a dish of this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
as never before or since then , domestic bud@@ dies - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - The Ess@@ ence of the country such as such .

while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmhouse in his kitchen , he sp@@ un like the million@@ th man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was a wonderful reality .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ute an excerpt from his stomach .
as described in the book a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Ms Roosevelt meant that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most boring food in Washington . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , has been rejected once the country returned to legs .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , Z@@ ett@@ man said , as well as science was applied to food .
the couple gave better understand the eating habits of bricks from brick mother in law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of waste food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bricks remember : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

after the plates had been vac@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roosevelt had lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ett@@ man , and added that it was a usual trick to miss a good prescri@@ ption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no beaten cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .

he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died during a barrel attack on the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil protection group , which according to the picture newspaper , has almost 6@@ 0,000 people saved the lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers rely on their own life to move people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the vision of the group : a video of civi@@ liz@@ ers , which shows him from a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the shining symbol character in the hor@@ ror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes he has never seen himself , according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have sealed up four frame bombs on the Alz@@ adia district , a was filled with chlor@@ inated gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from asthma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ite the picture of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
more rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ shar@@ ks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ shar@@ ie only get young talents at 150 years .
at the bottom of the North Atlantic coast in an hour he gets on average only 1.@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it acceler@@ ates the five meters long animal to a full 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span , which means for sp@@ ine a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the Evol@@ u@@ tionary biolog@@ ist assumed that Grön@@ land@@ shar@@ ks will be old .
only missing the evidence .
Grön@@ land@@ shar@@ ks are difficult to observe and finally live in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coastal areas of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they are water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface mostly in winter .
researchers have correspon@@ d@@ ingly little to know about the lifestyle of Greenland .
their time lap@@ ben@@ ds in moder@@ ation , when they are preparing six animals with a transmitter .
the prey make this shar@@ ks still : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bears .
maybe they hunt for sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice and are looking for Kad@@ aver , who from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues have now studied 28 Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the greatest 502 @-@ centi@@ metre was measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the liner core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this center of the eye lens appears before the birth of shar@@ ks , which included proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the len@@ tic@@ ular core .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons infected large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in contrast to 220 centi@@ meters length of the third smallest animal , the Lin@@ sen@@ u@@ cle@@ us contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
in its line@@ age , normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ meters long Greenland was at the age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could be assigned a age .
because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters is probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ shar@@ ie gets obviously at least one and a half centuries ago .
this should also be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bacon on the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on pointed , was caught before Alaska .
the low temperatures often run the organism of living animals on sa@@ fl@@ aming .
they mature then later - and slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often bigger .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal heat sink .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal is more dangerous and should focus on it as many as many offspring as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the Evol@@ u@@ tionary biolog@@ ist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein as early as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal ought to invest his resources in a long life .
design in double pack
the municipal council involved in the latest session focused on themes around building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel received the message from mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported living area can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the land of land , par@@ cel@@ eration and accessi@@ bility could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Road weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) for interested persons is nothing more in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the B@@ auf@@ l@@ aken in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and domestic sen@@ iors equally imp@@ acted .
as it was , building consent from now on in the Town Hall , via the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to be cons@@ ulted in its September meeting .
in order to res@@ ett@@ ish further commercial companies , connected to the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change its newly @-@ generated area plan in sub @-@ areas in the spring of this year .
in the area of sub @-@ time the commercial area has wi@@ dened by two plots toward state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefited from Bre@@ xit
the city of the Main , based in Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies in London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ chman , head of the competence of competence and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money @-@ houses can continue to run from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU passport for the so @-@ called EU @-@ pass is far enough for the approval in the UK .
these are just great US banks .
several banks have already announced to store jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects the 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , re@@ united the responsibility for monetary policy and super@@ vis@@ ing the largest banks of the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities , such as the European insurance respect E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk provisions .
in Paris , the Organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) , however , is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to Not@@ enb@@ ank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg there is a large fund industry , but as well as Dublin in infrastructure inferior to the infrastructure .
Frankfurt am far easier to reach the airport thanks to the great airport .
further points the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not as easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ chman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine you are also rent for first @-@ class commercial property by 50 percent higher than the Main .
also Frankfurt also offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consult@@ ancy Mer@@ cer , the city was standing on No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 and Paris on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if life quality is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ref@@ uses I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ xit , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my business researchers .
the power relations include the power relations : in London , according to figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , it was 6@@ 2500 .

on Friday Hillary Clinton published its tax return for 2015 , this revealed a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons killed USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton posted an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster , for their book about their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ton candidate for Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax returns to his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .

in a former opposite , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false exclusion and rein@@ for@@ cements in relation to his previous promises to publish its controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their controls , although they are not obliged by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a control test by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s elec@@ toral fight Ian Sam@@ s wrote on Twitter , relating to the publication of the Presi@@ dential Guard in the Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor to CNN says that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax tests are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already published his ref@@ usal issues relating to assets , his business contacts , and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , to publish up his tax return in the high level rep@@ ubli@@ can Tr@@ ump .
on Thursday she spoke the subject of a speech in Michigan during a speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or less tax during the 1990s , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax attor@@ neys and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in elec@@ toral campaign .
Clinton is supporting a scheme that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million for a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , he called his seat , whose Ber@@ kshire Hath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ ab@@ domin@@ ate has his seat to exchange their controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to IR@@ S as well as a control test of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already exerc@@ ised the idea for years ago by intensi@@ fying volunteers in the North Tanz@@ an@@ ias , a non@@ violent method to protect their houses and harvest without using animals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , many spe@@ ars have used to defend itself .
Friday is the World Water Day devoted to the animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ...

the first two steps include the lighting of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bubbles in a horn .

Jewish director strikes the Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; re@@ sign@@ ation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock , after he betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol hotel in Berlin , since it had requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shoah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin where he wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of hotels in the country .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a way to choose Israel via an own Call Center .
after a explanation , the director looked to the hotel reception .
the answer , which he received , &quot; sw@@ apped him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason behind it stood , dissolved in the director more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix will be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees were quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and was troubled .
that is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this hotel chain is in just this hotel chain is even greater shame . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident solved quite large reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called for a sc@@ andal .
some under@@ set the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been the alleged collection of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post that was pointed out that the hotel is located on the clas@@ sy spa sky , close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all the acc@@ us@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to record Israel in the express list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds , the country code has now been added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
with the repe@@ al of sanctions , the sanctions imposed by Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading set between Moscow and Teher@@ an at the end comparison by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions were lifted up against Iran , the interest in pages of Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , shared the ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trading structure is one of the greatest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade fair was reached by supplies of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is going for this year a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign nationals represented around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , first and travel to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached Top 20 of the countries , which concerns the number of places in Russia .
you could say that the record of Iranian tourists will be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians do visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes to change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civi@@ lization in a good state , &quot; he said .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner is stor@@ med at home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 year old from Glasgow took the inc@@ lin@@ ter who had made his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made the legend proud as he was stor@@ med at home to visit a victory from favorites New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y repeated the fifth of six Olympic med@@ alists .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the subway world championships in London , despite the return of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the exchange between Beijing and London was the replacement of the rider Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when Hin@@ ds up .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they remained as they saw potential in the vill@@ i that un@@ folds now .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y vic@@ t@@ orious - and Sk@@ inner replaced the qualifying lap in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand @-@ round the New Zealand prevailed in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap was scar@@ c@@ ely back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner stopped .
a strategy change made a large part of transformation , when Hin@@ der in a higher gear used to slow it and make it possible to maintain it and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they went to the podium .
23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name .
we set up a olymp@@ ic record in the final round and the World Champion is defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there was round about that he fell down after a weak start .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no ob@@ jection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
there was no such problem with such an over@@ lap victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels with all the GB flags at the Tri@@ bun@@ ny in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together in the last three months as team .
we came so bad with so many world titles that it was amazing to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation bringing seven out of 10 titles in Beijing and London .
if this is a Bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys it is in the field of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in one competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently sacred date for the British Sport ; there were also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be beaten for the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on of the day , but there was further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ish W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four Kilom@@ eters races .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held at the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins continued to focus on security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was cont@@ ested by the qualification before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the respective women competition , tomorrow continues and ended , av@@ anc@@ ée Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving its strong platform team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio went down .
it also played in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton , in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ ers , and re@@ tire from sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
but if one sees the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary GB@@ s that has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of melting electricity by Portland due to the increase of the energy contract
the future of aluminium melting of Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , and thus all supply contracts will rise , such as the supply of supply companies .
this step followed the decision of government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a payout for 20 years is running out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the system of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland will stand on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - may be endangered with a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point of Henry melting , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked up a closure .
this step follows the years long spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and last due to the electricity price for the facility .
AG@@ L , who supplies the large aluminium melting plant with his Lo@@ y Yang A plant in Lat@@ robe Valley shared that three other owners will announce their tre@@ aties .
the facility is in the majority of a joint venture between AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; shared the company .
AG@@ L continues to address the so @-@ called &quot; backup transactions &quot; to have entered into force starting November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month termination period , so they will end up in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ations for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L divided that it has already written the value of contracts already in its annual revenue of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book contracts to make the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ ill ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to supply the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that there have been a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into effect from November this year , even if there is still a declaration , why it has returned from the contract .
analy@@ st war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closing of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume around 600 meg@@ awatt and Tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ watts .
if both systems disappear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall , is on the cover of the September issue of the V@@ ogue gallery
Antonio J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the US V@@ ogue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the latest news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this co@@ vers brought me to tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , the entire kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family , as well as the presence of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest , and the presence of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic che@@ ek : they have all planned a surprise partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ held action almost every birthday episode ( Se@@ ac@@ rem@@ nant brought the phr@@ ase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Kris had to participate in this public@@ ity at this public@@ ity at 8 am &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but Kris had to participate in this public@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the September issue of the V@@ ogue , a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started with safety .
Kend@@ alls great Sister Kim , she likes her , put on what the V@@ ogue cover have been defeated ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine issue is a league for himself .
the September issue is the most recent edition of the year for V@@ ogue .
with a circum@@ ference , which is rather similar to a fashion magazine , re@@ sembles the issue a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut phe@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of rolling bearings ( 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still se@@ ated before the official announcement .
women who were already on cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Mod@@ ules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models which are famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer &apos;s Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence has been on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even at the low chance that Ms. J@@ enner is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break @-@ off model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or teen@@ agers from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are truly talented women who draw up in the entertainment sector .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success any success .
with their reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers became position in the world of fashion .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; The mist@@ y of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings de@@ pu@@ ffs up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but riding on the mist@@ rust seems to pass by the point .
a den@@ om@@ in@@ ator is on the cover of the September issue of the V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she runs Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures from yourself to their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells from her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in her leisure time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centres exceed 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0.000 inhabitants of the country are rejected by the municipal centers each year , while the industry makes the impact on the impact of other medi@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , friendly workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ og@@ ations and similar have - in their search for free legal advice and legal services .
legal services of the commune , which are already over@@ exposed , are ready for further reductions .
from June next year , these legal centers will be able to lose another 30 percent of their federal agents .
the Director of the Community Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of National Association of municipal centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected by people every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ al the government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ land municipal centers are funded chron@@ ically , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who have left violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debts , families that have been released by part@@ itions - all these people have problems right and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help you need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means thousands of hel@@ pless people from Queens@@ land to maintain with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the General Friends of the Federal Government and the Federal Minister of the Federal Minister of the Federal Government and the Sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to raise this central short@@ cuts , so that people may need help to obtain legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the provincial government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for justice to national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centers and its customers , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this constit@@ utes a representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; Newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , it is not possible after rec@@ orders in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good chances to continue the government of government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD passed by 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
the party , according to pol@@ l pol@@ ls only slightly before the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the left and AF@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , AF@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
the Gre@@ ens in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8,7 percent ) returned to the Schwerin State Parliament .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market 20 years ago .
today , the world domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ abytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fs with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with a minimum of 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet , but they are somehow from the age time of the internet era .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had previously announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ ery format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that number : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received by fax to reach the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , if too slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , an digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen found itself .
pretty proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could see in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the cell phone of the Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented disaster , was finally sold out to Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates the provider that all came later than Nokia .
forever and everywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion units were sold , on Samsung and Apple , these alone were 5@@ 55 million pieces .
the global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to do this , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the t@@ elecommunic@@ ations contacts come .
all around the smartphone are developed in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came to the start of the mass market in early 2007 , when the Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communications , easy to use by touch screen .
Apple &apos;s victory of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola , and Black@@ berry , dominated the market .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the s@@ lagen now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ understanding for 20 years after the invention .
on average every German now looks on his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the smartphone even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessi@@ bility is now also considered a curse and blessing .
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only going to place in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London when we used a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new possibilities for local companies and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we already have 10,000 new teaching positions , creating 40,000 new jobs and prepare an end at the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of expansion He@@ ath@@ rows is too big .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we can bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the two f@@ ters had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answered each of them asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
expansion is one way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn in wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as within the UK .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infra@@ structures in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport enter@@ terminal , it was built in the middle of the two busy running cat@@ chers .
now they are ready to deliver a third running cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Olympic Games were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and create le@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of that England . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse game &quot; regarding item blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with on@@ line@@ age money , according to one of the software manufacturers , get attempts to deal with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced , Ad@@ block Plus would block on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post , in which users might update their filters in the program to block back advertising in social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding of its advertis@@ ements in order to identify it , which is part of advertising , which is part of the advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle is underway since the invention of Ad @-@ block@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media has settled in the struggle is a strong indi@@ z , as wor@@ r@@ ying on the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe &apos;s last year , Adobe has supported some 200 million people . almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung is 84 percent of advertising revenue from fac@@ ebook .
the company does not have any effect on Desktop PCs , because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , a speaker shared with .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient big proportion of income that Facebook appears to be worth it as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that there would be his &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to update the people more control over it targeted advertising .
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would wor@@ r@@ ying new filters because they would also block contents on the page they are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user , this is no positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesperson on Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ad @-@ block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool that is why we focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to lay more control over the hands of the people .
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss free@@ way
the victim was in the middle of the night on the free@@ way .
the police calls witnesses to passing a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at an alleged suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman laid up in the dark &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 , which was used by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died yet on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , and the police told them , as well as any witnesses of the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was opened an investig@@ ator which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter has taken the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be waiting , whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a crash avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - one person in the dark on the free@@ way - was decided that the drivers didn &apos;t assume that a pede@@ stri@@ ans go in the middle of the night on the free@@ way as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police was acquitted of neg@@ ligent death , after having over@@ ride a man and killed one night at the A1 in the near of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 year old victims had drunk , and became un@@ conscious of the road , and took the court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court noted that the polic@@ eman -- who had responded to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an justified manner -- that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should notify the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA chin @-@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was hab@@ itable once
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms used by climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have been identified with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow circulation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere could have had to be slowly moving .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry places than the earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to host life and protecting life faster .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow conversion of Venus will exp@@ on@@ ize its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io explained in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds to protect the surface from a large part of the sun heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that re@@ sembles the evolution that has previously been suspected of planet research .

Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to low participation in the decision of the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately seek after a new trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy met in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the summer of summer , I thought about how I could improve this team as I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs and bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to achieve this , the Vision and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a determination of involvement in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently fulfilled .
Z@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy became the winner of the League Adams Award during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the league .
he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnes@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ers again take talks on strike strikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for the Nord@@ se@@ e@@ Oil Workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall be exposed to all parties parties for a new round of talk to the table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ c on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ sign the current stream of the current stream , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop some time sessions in the coming weeks , starting the next year to re@@ tire the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible pay@@ outs of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore @-@ contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts to the company provides the necessary room to get through the market down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shell has released its share of thousands of people and plans to give plans for its share of oil and gas industries in up to 10 countries as a result of its workforce by the British Energy company BG Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
energy companies are based on low gross prices under pressure , an economic situation that under@@ went the European Union &apos;s decision by decision of the British in June .
the Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest occup@@ ations that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion of spending will be expected for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star@@ base of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with Kepler World Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the star@@ board of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data will help to understand astronom@@ ers , why stars in star@@ fish are rotating at different rates and in which context the rotation @-@ time periods are standing with the planet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope we experience through the compar@@ isons of our results with other star@@ vation , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star@@ base of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , do now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are now fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates these stra@@ pping stars prop@@ ag@@ ated large amounts of star@@ winds .
since these winds are travelling by the stars of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is al@@ tert , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recogni@@ zes the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the newest catalog of rot@@ ations indicates that a more massive stars revol@@ ve than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull is compar@@ ing the stars with dancers , the larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes rotate than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that long@@ time rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
because the star@@ base of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ m@@ ical laboratory to compare qualities as rot@@ ations .
&quot; the star@@ base of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers a anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s still a lot ahead of us how we would like to know more how the How , When and Why stars will slow down their rotation rates , and so to speak their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the distribution rates of Ple@@ y@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star emerges
the tears were flown by Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from base to base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will go against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays each last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; contributed to the &apos; , explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 , he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract agreed upon him annually by 27 million US dollars annually .
until the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he will be in future as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 , he made the Yan@@ ke@@ es for some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays are only two other bas@@ eball players on top of the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the glory hall of the bas@@ eball .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so cont@@ ested , its occurr@@ ence out of space .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was called &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; to have taken mort@@ o@@ ides between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal at the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered as the main suspected , for years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounter@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have a favour for the year 2014 , because I played through a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez then said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his deportation days are also not silent .
while many bas@@ eball le@@ gen@@ ds received the big stage once again , Rodri@@ guez has had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include deportation tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az , and the actress Kate Hudson has said his sympathy with the Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; p@@ liers at the 4 : 9 defeat for the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ op@@ lanes
caught : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ling rehear@@ sal , Wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ aded by the first official doping .
an athl@@ ete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es became the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swimming pool in Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obst@@ acle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weights of Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been tested positively and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the anyway @-@ critical athlet@@ ics competitions this news for accidents occur .
in the last Sunday , Chen has been detected the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de last Sunday that is used as mas@@ k@@ elling remedy for d@@ op@@ amine substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion of the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 year old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , just around 0,@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen would have participated in the screening over 50 m Freestyle .
Chen has filed an opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires Chen &apos;s cooperation among the studies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we quote X@@ in@@ hua in a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ al@@ shof CAS and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , no more the IO@@ C , but the CAS is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive trial of Dan@@ ek@@ owa passed through the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the athlet@@ ics explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act in the forbidden substance to act blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ing EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended pro@@ vision@@ ally , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v was immediately noti@@ fications with criticism of the Athlet@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why sports@@ men did not pull the right sl@@ uts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians have been under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weights from the chron@@ ically exposed nation may not be used in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had tested three days earlier on an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both den@@ ies the intake , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is especially a heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had prohibited the complete Russian team to an exception for systematic d@@ ots the start , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya also produces numerous bad news .
in the swimming sport the former clubs in China had also made great disputes between athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t took the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I will be handed over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio .
sun was also at the centre of a meditation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and respect for D@@ oping bet@@ im@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested in 2014 with the Chinese nationals for stimul@@ ant Tri@@ g@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ ing : so per@@ fi@@ de and hack@@ ers their ran@@ s@@ om
programm@@ ers from black@@ mail @-@ malware access specific companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of malware , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 per cent of survey@@ ed companies have been at least once , partly several victims of an attack with Er@@ pres@@ so software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies had already aim at a ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims agreed will@@ ingly by the perpet@@ rators being desired to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their ex@@ change@@ over software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in company networks .
if they have been successful there , the potential to fire ran@@ s@@ om is significantly higher than private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a fri@@ ghtening rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ ats were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators newly discovered software for themselves .
only private users were the objective , but the change@@ over to company attacks was sc@@ ary quickly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , they search for un@@ long modified files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or Database files as well as to archives and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
afterwards the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the dec@@ ryp@@ tion code to the files , the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of the Bit@@ coin bit@@ coin .
but where in private users the personal photo database is on the game , it goes for companies to sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage fails when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break down the business activity , in case of a case , people in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals victims were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened with the loss of acute health ac@@ utely .
&quot; we always say to the victim : do not pay , you only promotes the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to refuse the demand of the perpet@@ rators in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hack@@ ers again know that and try to set up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the pay@@ load areas and the contact with the black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to set up a kind of customer service to take more money .
you will explain their victims via chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites , or dec@@ ryp@@ t free download files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you will have saved individuals after a few hundred Euros , companies must act hard and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ turn@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail , the hack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains safety experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ rano : &quot; a single person can write about a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their malware software then in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits produced by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivery included is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail will then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the fresh bought software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buying the set from a crime and commissioned to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is carried out per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , the crimin@@ als carry sp@@ ammer with the spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies which ensure their data better .
more than 50 per cent of the companies IT responsibilities in the mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust in order to protect Ran@@ som@@ ware via file back @-@ ups and sc@@ anner@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators already pursue new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data is no sufficient threat to successful creation , the perpet@@ rators are instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means the damage potential depending on the type of data is much higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators could now completely take new goals on the Internet of Things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstr@@ ating safety researcher , as they could have received with the Internet linked thermo@@ stat to their control .
in the middle of winter the un@@ folding of such a blocked heating could be quite a ran@@ s@@ om worth .
if the perpet@@ rators are then blocked in the future instead of the heating in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in the Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and versatile
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the vers@@ at@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new Jazz , has been actually very flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m tall HR @-@ V seems rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond too , there is no place close .
the materials of the interior space are well processed and work pleasant , only the cockpit top is falling down there .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 453 l at high and 10@@ 26 l at the folded back ) , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the return bench can be hau@@ led and offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high .
the trunk space can be loaded well , but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
he is likely to do his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment in the tested Top variant &quot; Executive &quot; has no desires to be desired .
the City emergency wiz@@ ard belongs to the safety systems ( works until the pace 32 ) , the coll@@ ision of coll@@ isions and trace assist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ isions sometimes irrit@@ ates sometimes because he rated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ ent objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable the remote control co@@ aches .
and the smart tem@@ po@@ re@@ gler re@@ acts to traffic sign recognition and thr@@ ott@@ les the speed .
the full connectivity is available only for top quality : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and a HDMI socket lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel engines are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro , the diesel over 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
Honda offers a versatile and versatile car with HR @-@ V .
Airline is not liable : fall on Flug@@ gast@@ ed bridge
a airline is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the air@@ lift .
for no liability is possible only with dangers that are typical of air traffic , argu@@ ed the national regional court in Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the cla@@ im@@ ers had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap in the fall .
the accident could , however , could happen everywhere - it handles a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay a compensation for damages .
disease : when paid the organizer
sick vac@@ ation@@ ers return only money when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten per cent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case , a family on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ ur@@ ry was severely affected by diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the tourists back to a defective plant , which supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family was the view that had been poor and def@@ endants against the organis@@ er .
before court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ers had no success .
while the clari@@ fication was defective in fact .
but the organizer reserves only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ers .
he had to assume that sea water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment .
do not have any im@@ pur@@ ities found in the samples of water .
the disease several hotel guests - perhaps due to infection from among each other - belonged to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 guests from 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people are concerned about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be d@@ ain@@ ly and decided to react to terror at the same time .
sure is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split .
we will not gain the terror@@ ists this triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a perpet@@ rators would have to leave the country , increase the security and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the parliamentary elections in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a middle @-@ digit size of several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symptoms of terrorism would be back again at penalty .
video monitoring should be improved if the ceas@@ e@@ thing is to be amended mainly by purchasing weapons in the Internet .
the last much of argu@@ ed per@@ missions for doctors should remain in terms of de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the doctors , as to the compan@@ ions of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with a view of some psych@@ ic thoughts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to meet a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for it .
teachers would have to be better prepared for handling trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
in pursu@@ it of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of covering investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD CEO Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior said clearly against shareholder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear for the s@@ coff@@ ers in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel , Gabriel , said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union according to a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abol@@ ition of double citizenship earlier .
a general prohibition against full wear is problem@@ atic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t do everything you are re@@ jects , and I rest the burning of the Bur@@ ka .

better traffic flow on the motorway exit
it looked regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law should be pro@@ longed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good news for all car passenger cars that stand in professional traffic on the ambient road every evening in the stadium when they travel across the motorway ( A 43 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country &apos;s road construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the descent Wes@@ eler Straße .
drivers can then go straight from the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des an early in @-@ time , whereby the overall run is improved on the varied section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Repres@@ entation in Münster @-@ West .

week@@ days , the back @-@ road goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping road , and sometimes also beyond .
this is why the needle from the B 51 is just before the Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic will only be guided on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt after a good three @-@ quarter years .
the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge has no longer required load capacity to absor@@ b the heavy traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as this narrow pass and the linked can be continued , the competent country can not say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , with years to expect : because the bridge has a official long time period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal decre@@ asing , the country has deliber@@ ately sought the traffic weaker time in the school holidays , because with disabilities .
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the site .

rain instead of star@@ ing : hope for the weather
the weather has made the star@@ ke @-@ gu@@ ck@@ ers in southwest Germany at night to Friday a stroke by the bill , but there is still hope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night was not suitable for clouds and rain badly for watching the sky spec@@ tro@@ el said the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see lots of stars in the sky .
at the star@@ base it is about Persian , who owns about 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour , among the quick@@ est star@@ ters .

relaxing Night : tips Against Sle@@ ep Dis@@ orders
in the evening , you wake up forever , at night you wake up for hours . in the morning , you don &apos;t have to think about getting enough sleep .
that is anything but rest@@ ful .
after all , it is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one @-@ quarter of adult sleeping distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanent than not rest@@ ful .
how can sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be diverse causes underlying them , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for Sle@@ ff@@ ective and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you under@@ stands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nie , so an input and sleep trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting .
even today , many people find themselves as un@@ satisfactory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
behind them , organic , mental or restra@@ ined factors can be found , but also medicines .
not rarely is the in@@ disorder expression of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake up is especially frequent with depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wo@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be different factors each other .
who for example has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , and w@@ akes up every two to three hours , and begins to sal@@ v@@ ise more than everyday problems and care , wo@@ e@@ ß is an example .
that leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you become a doctor with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
who should not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week , and should be ham@@ pered by the day should go to the physician .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look completely different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ s@@ laugh@@ tered , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has stimul@@ ant ability or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting , it is important to find out its causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , cognitive Behavi@@ oral therapy or also medicines - classic bed tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
located in Germany , he hardly emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why you should first turn to the physician in case of sleeping problems .
this can clari@@ fy with studies , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go into the sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining in sleep laboratory medicine , for example , with snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory effect , in case of disease we@@ ar@@ iness , at bed@@ bugs , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a dor@@ man@@ t disorder , Fi@@ etz@@ e explains .
you don &apos;t need to prepare for the analysis .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; just do not make lunch hi@@ ber@@ nation , &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
after sales up , one goes into bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electro@@ des on the body , one we@@ ars a nose glasses , a chest strap and a f@@ ist on the finger .
in addition , a camera shows the sleeping on the ceiling .
how can those affected the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of pitches on which you can get for better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleep and elev@@ ation times , not to be long in bed , not to sleep long in bed , not watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and night not at night - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not eligible .
what the jungle Camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler expressed itself on the disappo@@ inting cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .

now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook protected his ex @-@ team @-@ mate to critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where a € 20,000 € pre@@ mia gets and a jungle king 15@@ 0,000 € ought to be wonder@@ ed about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveying system in the swimming pool is bad , but the doping controls are very good .
we cannot compete with countries , which encourage a lot to promote and even run on the subject of D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that checks should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler has to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
it should be exactly the same way with countries .

airport : Bag@@ gage det@@ erg@@ ate on Bag@@ gage
professional Die@@ be at the Düsseldorf Airport
civil f@@ ists by Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded in charge of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the crime susp@@ ects had done several bags and luggage pil@@ es .
civil servants recognised a gang for civil servants around 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport , which became known for the polic@@ emen from previous theft .
the two women and two men had conducted several dol@@ ph@@ ies since the middle of July , and were generally consistent , working @-@ sti@@ ff@@ ly and especially professional .
the Speci@@ alists of the crime Commissioner 34 can have passed the thief , who had travelled strange to Germany in order to prove four deeds .
they took a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; altars , a few Lind@@ enb@@ elt , in between and one remaining head @-@ pav@@ ement : the ri@@ gs road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem like the first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
go along the street from east to west , one comes along playing fields , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades past .
somebody has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
compared to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demolished , it will be built here : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles on this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are in the last weeks pre@@ fers with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor , however , rooms are still occupied and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , at the beginning of the year , at the beginning of the year , the police force several times for a tough incident against the project , the area called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after June 22nd , the rooms were cleared out on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , according to official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons from the place , locked parts of the street , and held visitors from the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown home@@ owners are the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later police and buil@@ ders went under the singing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
at this summer afternoon , the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about early late .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are an elementary school and nur@@ ser@@ y .
left violence is not the main concern of many local residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in the Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , who are up here three children , are mainly generated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the wor@@ ries before increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who would wish to accompany a majority of polic@@ emen before v@@ and@@ al@@ ous@@ y left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police arise between home@@ owners and their neigh@@ bors , does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional labor quarter , which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high risk of poverty .
also house projects and the native projects belong to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire ma@@ inst@@ ream road close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the ma@@ inst@@ ream had been cleared by a real police force , many of the projects have been leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and are still inhabited by the people today , which they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ ber@@ liner from around the world : with them now local residents of GDR @-@ times and former house occupied their Kie@@ z .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings have been attacked for this development as symbols for this development : they det@@ ects it in collected discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been captured with paint .
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words of &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neigh@@ bors have this as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : off@@ ences such as body injury , according to polic@@ emen , according to polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the off@@ ences make atomic facts that the newly built new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses meet .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years , there is no talk of un@@ certainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is in terms of violence is it important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who have not been ordained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous burning cars leave it directly in the ri@@ gs already no longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the Archit@@ ect@@ in , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ s street - and stayed .
that &apos;s why it was so important that the local residents got their street back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July .
but in the eyes of population such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer the street will continue to take away : through character@@ less new@@ buildings in former construction of buildings that for@@ ge the old residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of the property apartments , which are not interesting for many people - here are rather people who are not so well affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction do I absolutely not gu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if any one is listening ?
there are fru@@ str@@ ation on all sides of fru@@ str@@ ation , also with the police and the inhabitants .
for ge@@ ared drawn about colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who moves away should be aware - just like someone who moves into a pub @-@ district , po@@ or@@ ly compl@@ ain about noise .
all users only with pre @-@ names are asked to be called by their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee manager for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ ago@@ in supports the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
you can see a contact partner for all players : refugees , working group refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine customer indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now here , the ei@@ vers Woll@@ mil@@ le au , which primarily has a problem .
so , some - less sp@@ ott@@ led rather than the multitude of desired task areas - meant , when the administration wanted to write the job .
a management expert with a talent for Languages and people , associated with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an intri@@ gu@@ ing wool mel@@ ee .
but management work is not their central area , An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le thinks .
above all , we go to organisation , work with people on site and behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 year old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and key players supported .
there are big and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the washing machine
it has been a serious problem for some time , to find apartments for the connecting flights which have been recognized .
the municip@@ alities are responsible for the connection .
they must under@@ take refugees in their own or rented apartments .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municip@@ alities itself .
the responsibility changes from the governor , to the commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his home .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to does not find private apartments .
it did not work so far , you have been attached to private apartments so deu@@ ter@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be known as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing machine .
but only with dwell@@ ings it is not done .
a point of view is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are internship plac@@ ements , training places , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and more hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants to be frozen or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house Masters , perform non@@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , such as An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
she hopes that the work for the congregation leads to a positive effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but occupation does not mean only work .
the day need a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop an in@@ ventive experience .
so , there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so we also jump to management and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain the refugees that it takes it , and they may be able to bridge the time , for example with language courses .
whoever of this feeling is developing , he could not work in Ur@@ bach to do not work and be un@@ profitable , I will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; problem cases , however , says customer honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always willing to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth job . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two still fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , Reg@@ ine customer says clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve may call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a risk of risk can be and will not exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are very sensitive .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ination should bring them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would happ@@ ily stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and volunteers have to look for activities in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer , sh@@ ove the politics .
actually it is un@@ fair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived there in Ur@@ bach , where we would like to go , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes the Ur@@ bacher know that the Ur@@ bacher know how to integrate the previous human being sen@@ sible .
there are about 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , they can help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , since there is no simple answers .
