<seg id="2">In infrastructure we invest in infrastructure and the trade agreement TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitors are at tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a general, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns about how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulating." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton would regulate the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">In contrast, he himself would be very different, Trump claims.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will be back massively, and he sets out for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton is saying: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes were exalted for the rich, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In those who are invests, Trump and Clinton will say nearly equal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicationin announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected by the state-ritical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Trump, there may be a partial internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and recovering the coal production in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate agreement he wants to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton aims to extend the renewable energies with its investment programme and calls:" "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both countries do not want to isolate us from international trade - but simply protect American jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger worth.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage is up, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the large discussion of the coming months would likely be more likely to develop the control policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before, that the budget deficit would only be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to ask at least from the rich people to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsider"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture, which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and an official end of the eight months to proclaim the words and economic sanctions." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But with Vladimir Putin his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palgrave in the reception, I cannot be able to forbid that Ankara wants to accept this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the setback, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles seemed fluffy and he didn't shine warmth, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a paper described that Erdogan would have been blurred as if never something shlimmer would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's government had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first that he mentioned in his introductory statement: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was deserted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared from and accused Ankara, Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was even bigger, because it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetroar rebuild is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For a long time, the state-controlled media led a heavy, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed like the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "on serious incidents, the accusations of executive officials have benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria, who are controlled by the so-called Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was only taking place because Putin received an excuse from the President Erdoğan, who wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a truce is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily associated with all the friends that he can get in a failed coup d "état almost his amtes during the last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights that each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and chartercompanies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late season onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted fruit and vegetables once the Turkish farm imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists for long, tomatoes for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West, since it was a weak response to the attempted power of power.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "the prolonged lot of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the result of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the result of the cool mood is to benefit from the cool mood and decrease Turkey's relationship to the west." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian President won a bonus in Ankara with security that he asked for the attempted coup d "état of the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-esteemed for Moscow is a self-understandable, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one as it once described me an analyst" "" "Alliance of Foreign Affairs" "", "" "" "Alliance of Foreign Affairs" "" "and can feel badly treated from the West and now disguise it." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow was recently announced the role as a peace stifflers, but where Russia and Turkey support contradictory pages." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours, both presidents say on the press conference, they would not even have thrown the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey dictated it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey abrupted the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma thrilled fans for this sport for years.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said Frankie in front of a few weeks at Epsom, that he had already brought 6,000 wins if it wasn't just a weekly and grand piano yodckey!</seg>

<seg id="22">From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the head of the British flat rendering for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was annoying.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole range of major tournament gains, including its famous "glorious seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he initially had difficulty when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to deduct his two flaps and to return to its taxation.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he is not yet at the end - Dettori said earlier once, that he wants to continue playing at least 50.ten years of age.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin moist Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's share of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin it is that Putin was ordered without giving reasons" "" "the dismissal Ivanovs by his duties as Chairman of the Russian President." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been the Deputy chairman since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born 1972 in Tallinn, Germany, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later was a log head and leader manager of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support staff and controls on the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do you convince the ridiculous faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time of one of the closest affiliated Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret services, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin that was broadcasted on television, both men asserted that Chief of Staff came back to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for cameras, there are just a few of them - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody currently know that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official allegation - that a man who once was promoted to as potential president, wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to big skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin that are quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It's true that I asked you in early 2012 to put this very complicated item - you could almost say - complainable post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Council (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin went to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people who trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was accepted that Ivanov could have been after Putin's second term of office President of Russia, as a third term Putin could have expired against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the cap between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge pcks are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a betongation for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted at its place.</seg>

<seg id="6">First of all is the question: who should build the favorable apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A rule is missing so far.</seg>

<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left also wants to have hardships for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what Bratmann, then a waste of the situation on the residential market is about.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the conversion concept is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the homes of homes.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social houses in the western town is drastically increased, from the goal of the so-called mixture.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting trip to health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating, seeing how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child go no longer out without going outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time, on screens, was lambted in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it is about to get people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on screen was initially limited to the TV, then restricted to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I take it off of course on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were created for the video games in the 1990s (later, a drawing series, playing cards and other spin-off) were created.</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of popculture decreased the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand to overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go has more users than kids and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smart phones go outside and search for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the car, and leaped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, who pursued 35,000 users, divided the Washington Post to launch the number of people followed within two days after the launch of the game, which exercise every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it simply looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public connaissance campaigns for health, people want to take" "" "take time" "" "to get" "" "from the sofa" "" "and" "" "sit on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look at the end." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances to reduce cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, which is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the marvellous about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are thus three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close up new friends on hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mürmetric games that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charms and the use is recreated with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, however, there will be more games that will become a real world of apps and virtual reality with the activites in the real world, and they will help many people in hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I suggest under the women's Olympics in the tower and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I've been doing so dominant in every summer olympiade since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three bands, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspires many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, who is Cathedkin, is proud of everyone.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the past four years, number one was one of Afro-Americans.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiad in America and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected, but masterful Gymasticroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman, who won gold with an individual case event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but you do not see classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four people in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns is a more expensive sport and Turner first line in private gyms, which are up by parents, which come up for training, introductory, travel and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner get their overall training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the turnes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the congregations of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded by my Turnhalle for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we had free and affordable Turns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) were trained and national and international victors are trained.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality turkey, which make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnes develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits for health as well as for schooling and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to interest for the turnes and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic Team golds and thank you so many young girls motivates with different background to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and worgereflex to a serious test by asking some of the most polluted places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a Euro-Schein, a banquet at Piccadilly Circus, a flushing knob of a migratory toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>

<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria, as well as its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he stopped, more than a bad aftertaste in my mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright was known to test the resistance of its intestines by travelling through the world, and did eat peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to train stations up to rinse buttons of toilets, the task was definitively placed under a sample</seg>

<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometres of freshly-washed hands is less than 60.</seg>

<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't stop here, because it is ecclonable here.</seg>

<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to set them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way in the consumer.</seg>

<seg id="2">A asoziale family left her social home after a delay of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were violently removed from their property, shocking employees found the property in a irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were puded holes up, wood panels were cleaned up, rubbish was decorated on the floor and graffiti was adorned to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were settled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears the apartment is no longer able to repair.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare here and I am the view that people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, since this property is probably considered as beautiful part Cornwalls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons, who lived in the apartment, and the police told that the family had joined the family, intimiddles of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive cry, streetries and flukes.</seg>

<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner this week, after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to go voluntarily.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it failed to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals, 20 years long.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the municipal hospital, rubbish and old toys were cast down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that it was to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, since a Delogation is always the last step, the Cornwall Housing is considered." ""</seg>

<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the assembly, who are braised for us and have given us the information provided.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will feel solace in some neighbors, and the message conveys that antisocidal behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives do not receive anything of the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the country tag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021, the country code will not return directly at the end of the summer holidays, the severance parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For stupid things are not about: summer holidays, heat and land art struggle - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are convinced by the electors are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most tourists who are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, aren't the locals, so don't choose the country tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical issues: in the holidays, helpers that hang up posters, flaps air balloons, flyers, flaps only by the end.</seg>
<seg id="9">Up to 4 September 2016, the election and the last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave a campaign just about the people over.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's about something: Prime Minister, Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the most powerful party in 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will be exciting, like strongly Neuling AFD cuts and what remains at the end of the partition remains.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 leader, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees one of his posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through land, spread out roses and chatting a little with the people, as it was already his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, soul has got cold feet and Merkel and gives Merkel the blame for the AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, you" "" "We will create" "" "the rise of the right hand lists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office right now." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its nickname data, the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place for a wrong place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She was invited by Chancellor Angela Merkel twice. Angela Merkel is in the Northeast.</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "that, so Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinated role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that in the country you have strangled the base, that it must be very strict again to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens, in the waves of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU-elector Kokert, however, is self-extracting:" "" "you need to go where there are blowing, namely where the people are: Dormiteste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party needs to be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot on the game stands, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just just under the AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election, the SPD decided yet to win 35.6 percent prior to the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in the polls, might need to create the leap into the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue of holiday need a modern virtue and impose its election campaign into the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign" calls it the president Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green choices on track search for local pacers are among the tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the Spitzenkandidatin, curvt straight with a houseboat by the mecclenburial lakes and finds it still nice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who buys sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before reading the comment, in order to survive it under the pseudonym of non-alleymen of men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most common reformation of Schallplatten does not want to welcome a boom in millennials who want to welcome new unity of physical objects, but is attributable to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have bought a record recently, are all likable according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional significance: their emotions rather retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would carry me the camera while I stay in the bustling street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wildly before I stand up, my hands hold and something turns up like:" "" "so, let's take a close look at it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's have a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly accepting its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which an independent seller have been resident, there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera man to switch the camera for the next part, in which I get up to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I mean by sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) to Reckless Records (Data, probably about the 20) sequence, is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">This record plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not having responded to him), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records when it appeared to buy and buy items which he sold, when he was young and pleases.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are from the late '60s, early' 70s, which appeared as I had 11 or 12. things, in which I probably was too young to buy them" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "he is true that those who buy plates are rather introverted and likes to spend time, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets at YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and have prompted to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">By the conversations, which I have led, people usually have emptorious so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It just takes some seconds in a business like Phonica to detect that record shops offers a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some turnfans feel overcome by the digital world and want to draw back to stability of trusted record levels, of objects, happy jugenderers.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions than a kind of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's like a collector for me so and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "a staff from a panel stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM announced in April that almost 50% of people who have bought a record last month they haven't heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll also found out that 41% have a record player who never use them, while 7% of those who buy one plate, do not own turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while passing through a stack of Bossa Nova Kompillows.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who is at Sounds of the Universe (Data number: three men middle age) works, has noticed a "trophy effect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just recently came here and said," "" "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Schallplatte, so that I can put it into the shelf." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicians.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I have no turntables." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who only cleanse slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "Fopp, dedicated to the records almost a whole floor has an open audience when I'm going to clean." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples about 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest Synthesizers and sexoned Pop instead of experimental jazz-weaned from the speakers - is it good to see such diverseness among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks extremely lonely, but nagging psychic traumata are hard to set if you stand in addition to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs on the business for a few minutes and considered the variety of boards used for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes rather a display bumblebee as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">They don't deserve a lot, therefore, collecting records no real option, says she.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from any computer or any other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a adorable sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business which is said that a new generation of turntables should have inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I give the note, I observe the jeans hotline, I observe a group of young teenagers to group about a moment to group polluoid cameras before a father and his daughter to buy a Crosley disk player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees her - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in view of what every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Sohos, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "it's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also that is the most for luxury objects like plates." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, they have at least in record stores in Soho, the big number of female collectors and turntables who exist in reality, stores and in onlineforen.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with security at a stroll through recordings of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they staring a gaze of an inconceworthy, 30-year old false presenter, who rises all of the shoulders of middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no engine of inaldic gold than in these games, and I want to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 tough hieve which enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment on Estacio since Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if it was only those who were sitting at the Rule, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was allpresent as she gave to the second Olympic Games in a row without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of the British Sports who put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.ter is unaudited deployment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletics that reflect upon the surface with elegance of swarf, which is not reflected by the type of Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing there is a battalion to the helpers, which make the difference and it was no more safe than the coach, who wouldn't know that day if he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he told he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had blister cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, he spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was fortunate that he could begin at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, where the break was at a minimum, if this is the correct term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">It begins like that.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory went their first thoughts about Williams who had a annoying morning to talk more than anything else and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who used as a centurion in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that is perhaps something extremely, but it is so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much that means how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, hence a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have a better person for a trainer or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no race lost in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even within the last 500 meters, when the teams met for New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had a lot to reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen, "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to have not to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to make no firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take time out for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I did not want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have been too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realise that I am a Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and inevitable, a lawless relay runs between competition and strebs.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which will protect the swimming pool from the bracelets for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to a newspaper in the queue in the Coffeshop without talking about Simone Bilit, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time with the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimplets, would definitely have been sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-free advertising, if it would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampoline around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always swim in the chest, and may reign for it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make arguments for my particular favorites, then leave the attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the tramp jump already since 2000 an Olympic event, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became the last 16 years so much that I had asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympic sports.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the U.S. athletes sent for competition, it has never gained a medal at a trampoline and has had an athlete until 2012 has made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping on a certain lateral side, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear for a Clownsschule as those that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a surviving enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonaround of his never wanted swollen replacements - but also the grazie of gym and diving, which combines two sports, which basically combines it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, Hreal and Saltos) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed according to official Olympics, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallions must go on to gold further, faster, upwards and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes go and back, upwards and downwards at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not chase the finish line or the original text, but also in the television broadcast another cave: the world or the Olympic lord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal of striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic, and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think about looking at this games as something wearingly.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the objective.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prunes, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, goes up, then downward, then back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the destination, no ditches in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant advancement of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a post block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who probably will probably overlook over in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Angprosy and the objectification of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley decided to meet his new fan base after the end of the Wall Street Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dirty meetings during clashes were killed during clashes with police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia ready to break?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past ten years, there was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid allies of West Africa with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shaken the country and extended in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights, the response of the government was merciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses accused that policemen were shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about protests, probably from the last or early of this year, show how safety people strike young people with shocks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to hold this country and will even be more difficult," "" "Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services cooperate closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pin train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia had everything else as a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, which dissidents have been effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, driven or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you underside people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Jyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation was protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use until spice with regards to the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a vast election of last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions climb along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for these tender, controversial line required in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts agree that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Oglides, who were more or less forced in recent years, could use the turbulence and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitter feeling after years of age accumulate under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap smartphones were more common and improved the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, so many people can still communicate over the Internet Proxies, hide it, where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians asked that they were gathered for protests against protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnication in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Equal prospered the Amharas, who from Aeolian are predominantly of Christian highlands, in politics and the economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is just changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The major protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and they are dominant in the military, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">According to his death, Mr. Meles, a former military leader, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was particularly toxic to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing in this basic skill," "" "Mr. Abdi said a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst tell that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear, that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had been a rebellion in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting against the government and stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razors many Protestants were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and those days of unrest was over quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new Pendlersuit, as well as for their measurable progress in the poverty control.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intention of the internal iniquity of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protestants in Gondar, a amharic city, headed by Tigray, and the hate against the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests against the US and other Western allies are bringing into an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for digging flights over the neighboring Somalia, although they recently changed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "during the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want to collapse the ally in an already volatile region." ""</seg>

<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, who was published on Friday, showed a tour with a big lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head-head in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump tries to apologize for his provoking assertions, he often accused His critics to disfrail or understand his testimony.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he intensified in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze his loyal fellow-strewns into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent interspeaking, gave herself great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandsharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandsharie only get young talents at 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the bottom of the North Atlantic coast in an hour he gets on average only 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it accelerates the five meters long animal to a full 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This long-term lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate of Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means for spine a world record." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the Evolutionary biologist assumed that Grönlandsharks will be old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandsharks are difficult to observe and finally live in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coastal areas of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they are water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface mostly in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have correspondingly little to know about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time lapbends in moderation, when they are preparing six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">The prey make this sharks still: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt for sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice and are looking for Kadaver, who from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now studied 28 Greenland's sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the greatest 502-centimetre was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the liner core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens appears before the birth of sharks, which included proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons infected large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast to 220 centimeters length of the third smallest animal, the Linsenucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its lineage, normal carbon-14 quantities had normal carbon-14 quantities, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland was at the age of 335 years, while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could be assigned a age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Grönlandsharie gets obviously at least one and a half centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon on the neck a 120 year old harpoon pointed, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">The low temperatures often run the organism of living animals on saflaming.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature then later - and slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often bigger.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal heat sink.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal is more dangerous and should focus on it as many as many offspring as possible," "" "explains the Evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein as early as possible." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner's last night at the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23 year old from Glasgow took the inclinter who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy. he made the legend proud as he was stormed at home to visit a victory from favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy repeated the fifth of six Olympic medalists.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took place in March at the subway world championships in London, despite the return of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The exchange between Beijing and London was the replacement of the rider Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time when Hinds up.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that tried to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man when they remained as they saw potential in the villi that unfolds now.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner replaced the qualifying lap in the qualifying rounds, but in the stand-round the New Zealand prevailed in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap was scarcely back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner stopped.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a large part of transformation, when Hinder in a higher gear used to slow it and make it possible to maintain it and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they went to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up a olympic record in the final round and the World Champion is defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys there was round about that he fell down after a weak start.</seg>

<seg id="24">We came together in the last three months as team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so bad with so many world titles that it was amazing to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation bringing seven out of 10 titles in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a Barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days at the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kennys it is in the field of possible that he repeated Hoys victory of three olympic gold medals in one competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for the British Sport; there were also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving its strong platform team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio went down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It also played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton, in the midst of sexism and bulbingers, and retire from sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if one sees the first evening of the competition at the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary GBs that has reached its peak at the perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of melting electricity by Portland due to the increase of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of aluminium melting of Portland, Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract, and thus all supply contracts will rise, such as the supply of supply companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A payout for 20 years is running out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the system of ALCOA in Portland will stand on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - may be endangered with a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, ALCOA closed the Point of Henry melting, which led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of ALCOA in Portland loses money and risked up a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years long speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and last due to the electricity price for the facility.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, who supplies the large aluminium melting plant with his Loy Yang A plant in Latrobe Valley shared that three other owners will announce their treaties.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is in the majority of a joint venture between ALCOA and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp will hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt," shared the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continues to address the so-called "backup transactions" to have entered into force starting November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month termination period, so they will end up in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," "" "said the power supply." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminations for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL divided that it has already written the value of contracts already in its annual revenue of $187 million in "expectation of cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "ALCOA said that the decision to book contracts to make the" "" "Skill..." "" "to supply the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that there have been a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have come into effect from November this year, even if there is still a declaration, why it has returned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analyst warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closing of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago complex near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatt and Tomago around 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both systems disappear from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>

<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they are somehow from the age time of the internet era.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had previously announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as "office in the Westentery format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that number: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received by fax to reach the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, if too slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, an digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>

<seg id="19">The average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could see in August 1996 that communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, although not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cell phone of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold out to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today dominates the provider that all came later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Forever and everywhere, this is today for a lot of people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareats were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators newly discovered software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the objective, but the changeover to company attacks was scary quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, they search for unlong modified files such as Word-, Excel- or Database files as well as to archives and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the decryption code to the files, the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of the Bitcoin bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private users the personal photo database is on the game, it goes for companies to sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage fails when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses through Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break down the business activity, in case of a case, people in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals victims were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened with the loss of acute health acutely.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victim: do not pay, you only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to refuse the demand of the perpetrators in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to set up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure examined the payload areas and the contact with the blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to set up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You will explain their victims via chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, freely accessible support sites, or decrypt free download files.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "and you will have saved individuals after a few hundred Euros, companies must act hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unturnable." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware-blackmail, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains safety experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Soprano: "a single person can write about a ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software then in the form of a software building to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits produced by the malware itself, advice and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "delivery included is an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail will then seek further hackers to spread the fresh bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums in the underground, buying the set from a crime and commissioned to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is carried out per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "generally, the criminals carry spammer with the spread" "", "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies which ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of the companies IT responsibilities in the malwarebytes survey trust in order to protect Ransomware via file back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data is no sufficient threat to successful creation, the perpetrators are instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes-CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means the damage potential depending on the type of data is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could now completely take new goals on the Internet of Things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrating safety researcher, as they could have received with the Internet linked thermostat to their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the unfolding of such a blocked heating could be quite a ransom worth.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are then blocked in the future instead of the heating in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, you wake up forever, at night you wake up for hours. in the morning, you don't have to think about getting enough sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is anything but restful.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, it is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one-quarter of adult sleeping disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanent than not restful.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be diverse causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Sleffective and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understands, however, is the Insomnie, so an input and sleep troubleshooting.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even today, many people find themselves as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind them, organic, mental or restrained factors can be found, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the indisorder expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early wake up is especially frequent with depression," "" "says Woeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be different factors each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example has a herniated disc, can be bad, and wakes up every two to three hours, and begins to salvise more than everyday problems and care, woeß is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">That leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you become a doctor with sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who should not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week, and should be hampered by the day should go to the physician.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: one is beaten, tired, unslaughtered, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has stimulant ability or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the troubleshooting, it is important to find out its causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive Behavioral therapy or also medicines - classic bed tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Located in Germany, he hardly emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first turn to the physician in case of sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with studies, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go into the sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in sleep laboratory medicine, for example, with snoring with respiratory effect, in case of disease weariness, at bedbugs, or if you don't find the cause of a dormant disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't need to prepare for the analysis.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just do not make lunch hibernation," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After sales up, one goes into bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose glasses, a chest strap and a fist on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera shows the sleeping on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitches on which you can get for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleep and elevation times, not to be long in bed, not to sleep long in bed, not watch TV to sleep, alcohol, and night not at night - then you start to count immediately, and that's quite and not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown homeowners are the rooms.</seg>

<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings have been attacked for this development as symbols for this development: they detects it in collected discs or freshly painted facades that have been captured with paint.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words of "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbors have this as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: offences such as body injury, according to policemen, according to policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make atomic facts that the newly built newbuildings and newly renovated houses meet.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years, there is no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "what is in terms of violence is it important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been ordained." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars leave it directly in the rigs already no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the Architectin, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">New gebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigs street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important that the local residents got their street back: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of population such as Neugebauer the street will continue to take away: through characterless newbuildings in former construction of buildings that forge the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "all of the property apartments, which are not interesting for many people - here are rather people who are not so well affected," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction do I absolutely not guise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if any one is listening?</seg>
<seg id="36">There are frustration on all sides of frustration, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For geared drawn about colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who moves away should be aware - just like someone who moves into a pub-district, poorly complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All users only with pre-names are asked to be called by their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee manager for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagoin supports the team of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">You can see a contact partner for all players: refugees, working group refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the eivers Wollmille au, which primarily has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spottled rather than the multitude of desired task areas - meant, when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">A management expert with a talent for Languages and people, associated with a longstanding experience in the field of social work, just an intriguing wool melee.</seg>
<seg id="10">But management work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle thinks.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, we go to organisation, work with people on site and behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31 year old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle honors and key players supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing machine</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time, to find apartments for the connecting flights which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must undertake refugees in their own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the governor, to the commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his home.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It did not work so far, you have been attached to private apartments so deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings must be known as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing machine.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with dwellings it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">A point of view is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internship placements, training places, school courts, one-euro jobs and more helpers for refugees and migrants to be frozen or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house Masters, perform nonprofit work - and that motivates and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the congregation leads to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But occupation does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop an inventive experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump to management and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must explain the refugees that it takes it, and they may be able to bridge the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever of this feeling is developing, he could not work in Urbach to do not work and be unprofitable, I will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "problem cases, however, says customer honest," "" "people, with whom nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always willing to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth job."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two still fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no, Regine customer says clearly," "" "what some naive may call" "". "a risk of risk can be and will not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are very sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassination should bring them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would happily stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and volunteers have to look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, shove the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived there in Urbach, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes the Urbacher know that the Urbacher know how to integrate the previous human being sensible.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they can help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, since there is no simple answers.</seg>
