Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not conclu@@ sive .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting it should also deal with the Palest@@ in@@ ians and the discuss@@ ing two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been very curious for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing sett@@ lements of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of intention for the peace process .
the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme was further deteri@@ or@@ ated by the Obama &apos;s Iranian nuclear program .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu was referring to the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to the U.S. Congress a controversial speech that was rated as an affair with Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not answered with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the right choice in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor to have shot his girlfriend in a call
in a not@@ ebook Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told with a slightly sk@@ il@@ ful voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Lamb of God was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said to be found the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the House , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ples of Amy Pr@@ er@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that I had wished for a white block : &quot; I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved . &quot; this was , according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb standing in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already sold 300 miles to the school where , according to the police , he had shot a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University of Poli@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University assist@@ ants have heard their shooting at 10 : 18 a.m .
he said that Lamb has made the fat@@ eful not@@ ion at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : the lamb took the life when the police locked him .
one day after shooting in the university , students and instru@@ c@@ tors forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to hide a picture of which Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the states on both ends of the state , as also what students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ t died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal incident .
Schmidt herself stated in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both of them in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose apprentic@@ eship comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , the Lamb glorified , &quot; he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
Lamb had asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university appears that the doctor had worked so hard for a Lamb that would not provide for an automatic way to an order as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ be@@ ard said he kno@@ cks nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can &apos;t answer any more .
after escape from the campus , the police found lam@@ bs later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ark@@ ansas .
before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ane Johnson .
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y in the spring .
one of the long term girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool elder ch@@ ap , who tried some years to teach her guitar play .
back to the women &apos;s pitch .
every girl melted away , when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , 40 now and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ eat were obviously a few days together .
in the emergency , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that had a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er gr@@ in .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ er@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ els , said they were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
her and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ w said he never met record but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb ch@@ anced when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail emerged three years ago both on a summer @-@ year market .
later they played together with one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
there was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a low @-@ lit room near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ on@@ iss Night in the night 5 September , after Lamb began his guitar and harmon@@ ic cy@@ n@@ iel over before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that anything would not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the hab@@ itats and moved them together .
I mean , they both had a good sense for sh@@ ear .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester students and specialized on American banks and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at school .
he was married with three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , and was President of its Brotherhood and Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cleveland , including instru@@ c@@ tors , students , students and members of the Municip@@ ality .
mid@@ section &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vig@@ il , while the University Hospital &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to return to our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s report from Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press author Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now said that Lamb had shot an emergency , and that Lamb signed in his emergency p@@ asser@@ t as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever got married .

Michael J. Fox opens his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remark@@ ably remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the theater , and I notice that the seat is beside me blank , and it will slowly become clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I am a sim@@ ulated gen@@ ome and a arm length of it away with the Princess of Wales on a Date .

UN CEO says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon says that Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery to millions of people .
the UN leader calls again all parties , including the UN Security Council , to negoti@@ ate oneself and integ@@ rative negotiations to find a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet foreign ministers of the five constant member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the outskirts of the Minist@@ ers of the General Assembly , in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the divisions exist in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that situation are in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban still challenged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity with Iran when tack@@ ling the crisis in Syria , they have proven the commitment to achieve a nuclear agreement with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Re@@ fra@@ ctions that run Donald Tr@@ ump to take seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump of the top courses in pol@@ ls , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national pol@@ ls run Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to question seriously what it means for the nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the pol@@ l .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys became a leader in the Asc@@ ent Herman Cain , of which nobody ever won a state in the Nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he could fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recogni@@ zes tr@@ um@@ ps fe@@ asi@@ veness and start to over@@ take their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some recent changes that indicate that real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary period :
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s popularity values are turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey on Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of them say they have a negative opinion .
these figures keep themselves in early states .
last week , Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac &apos;s vote in I@@ owa adopted that 60 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters were happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the rep@@ ubli@@ can , they would be either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son will say about the same enthusiasm as a tr@@ ump ( 43 percent ) they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 per cent , which says the same about Tr@@ ump .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 % of the rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied , &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate would be .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ized for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive comments , 52 per cent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans would believe that the real tem@@ per has given the correct temperature name for one president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first indi@@ scri@@ minate state of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a Commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to perform effective his office and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House P@@ asse , so ABC / post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they asc@@ end their gel@@ ding , rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oter jum@@ ped for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , four of ten states that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten in July put their money to Je@@ b Bush .
full disclos@@ ure : GO@@ P @-@ voters were not the declared crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination , compared to 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nonetheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters stand out for a plau@@ sible campaign .
even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans have gathered for another Candi@@ date , Tr@@ ump is killing almost everyone .
some experts point out that the spl@@ itter@@ ing field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps guidance , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey on the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump assist the majority .
he is ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , prior to Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Kas@@ im and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ head @-@ head .
a close majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans said that they have formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday show that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump says they have fixed their votes .
of course , things can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 percent said they had to leave the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as often as a tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with the Tr@@ ump entering the theme of Im@@ migration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign of Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ pe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the emig@@ ration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expres@@ sions of Tr@@ ump will keep crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans by the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re @-@ oriented efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday they say six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans that they agree with a cl@@ ump in question of immig@@ ration .
as long as immig@@ ration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump will do it .
the fru@@ str@@ ation on the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son &apos;s Donald Tr@@ ump , and Ben Car@@ son , now ent@@ ails mainly through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ t survey by ABC / Post they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government results .
and they are fur@@ ious to Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa before two weeks shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent of &quot; un@@ happy and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ h@@ oods
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you can find the most expensive con@@ domin@@ ium - with views over the North @-@ desert stal@@ em@@ ate .
in the street , one square meter of a resort house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects naturally is limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular layers a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich is not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top @-@ nor@@ ms , however , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Agency Engel &amp; Völ@@ ker has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with quar@@ rels and di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
several t@@ enth@@ s of a thousand Euros - per square meter , you can do well .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is located right here , not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream launch thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ sc@@ orer in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just got a run .
a lucky match by Thomas Müller , the FC Bayern was the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran it .
a so@@ vereign pre@@ lu@@ de to the Champions League Cup season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze added a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the wit@@ ch com@@ bo of Piraeus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ play in the Champions League of the Greek record winner Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mül@@ lers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9. ) deserves to 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth month in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to finally catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
he received the Grand Prix of the Champions League for Bavaria with his 28. of Friday in the Champions League of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , which would pass a f@@ lange @-@ driven shot of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the game in the kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of the Fran@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 , Bavaria - and the Munich ceased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without shining .
Pi@@ re@@ e had won his youngest six home games in the Royal class , including its famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , there were also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria is still defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , wouldn &apos;t be the next victim .
they went brave , but with their aggressive efforts , they often go to work .
the attacks were led too often by playing office on left sides Douglas Costa , who rarely came through the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right side , when his flan@@ k hit the right eye on the left side of To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski was the best occasions in half .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms took the head ball in Poland by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct connection , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knees ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although Bayern dominated their dominant game , Pir@@ ate was able to run con@@ i@@ fs .
on Tor@@ hil@@ ter Manuel Neuer has been permanent .
thus having a shot shot by ide@@ ye on the lan@@ tern ( 5@@ 6th ) .
new Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a quarter b@@ agu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it doing well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems , back in the cad@@ res , sat at first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was given the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matthias Sam@@ ers said at &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who wants to make something else from it is a mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola also decided on the first change , when he finished King@@ sley Com@@ an for his par@@ ked Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ 2 ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller , he still sat on top .
in front of the game , it came to Kra@@ v@@ all stadium .
after a smaller group of we@@ aken Bavaria fans in their audience blo@@ c obviously failed to provo@@ ke pirates with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with whi@@ ps against the Munich trailer .
at least one Bayern fan has been injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , so that not only the lungs , but also the teeth - a Pots@@ damer Lang@@ age study .
the good news : for deci@@ ding , the risk falls rapidly .
smokers have much increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this emerges from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking , smokers lay the risk of losing their teeth at pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 fold higher .
the scientists had more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ation of the gum , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the link between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to frequent gum disease by smokers .
not clari@@ fied , however , smoking also increased risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking at smoking , could decrease risk but within a short time , researchers at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there can be more than ten years , until the threat to non @-@ smoking remains to the level of non @-@ smoking , Thomas Dietrich von der English University of Birmingham .
they dare to persu@@ ade people who are non@@ smoking , said study leader H@@ einer Bo@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking cuts the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge as well as to the age of good health .
over 20 percent of the population aged from 65 to 74 years of age are affected by law@@ less@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with him .
earlier tests have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early b@@ out of a increase .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
Archae@@ ologist attack@@ ing the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne on rem@@ n@@ ants from the late anti@@ quity
for the repeated time , archaeological sites have been carried out in Cologne at the right banks of the Rhine .
following the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ ae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings , said the Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the start of the construction work on the Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans are looking for ground monuments .
the Museum has always been added to the Museum of Archae@@ ology for Archae@@ ology in all buildings in Cologne .
the arch@@ ae@@ ologists were now found in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration agreement for dischar@@ ging the stre@@ its over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreements TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private &amp; light facilities for disputes between corpor@@ ations and countries should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström &apos;s competent EU Commissioner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the open @-@ trade talks with the USA .
the German government announced support .
TTIP is meant to develop the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration process con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely see that the EU states and the U.S. have to choose an independent judge for a new investment plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be equal to the EU , the US and outside EU states .
for the first time , a second instance is ear@@ marked .
it would allow it to rise against the ur@@ anium .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s share of tension has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited since his election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s share , and set himself up with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is set to rise to question the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , while the media is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour de@@ pu@@ ties .
he called &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could do some sessions to their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , as she comes to a member of the Sh@@ att@@ enk@@ inet@@ ts and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during the singing of the Labour Party , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory M@@ PS prov@@ oked and stands in the centre of several title pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has grab@@ bed attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two news night program , he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ sixth of the parliamentary party was originally supported as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent is the BBC Robin Bran@@ t said that political differences are also stack@@ ed within the labour &quot; foot@@ prints &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns pron@@ oun@@ cements on position about the European Union and the limitation with profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes anticip@@ ate to remove the whole idea of a limit in total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , Mr Smith said , the shadow of work and pen@@ sions that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; become clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since then he has been a T@@ ory leader , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another polit@@ ician would say that he has given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions towards Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s findings in front of the Prime Minister is , and that he purpos@@ ed both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; punch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the stre@@ ak with a hook @-@ in , and instead , purpos@@ ed to focus on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said Angela Eagle , the Shadow Business Minister will represent him if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has also brought the idea of speaking other colleagues occasionally , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he was launched in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he was involved in the style of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cas@@ le theatre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a few years later he acknowledged that he failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as she was sent on television in 1990 , the quest@@ ionn@@ aire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of one &apos;s leader and his position among his par@@ liament@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed , they become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extended reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot;

pounds increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound climbed up to data , which is an increase in the UK &apos;s pay@@ roll . at the same time , FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s security target .
between May and July the result was increased by 2.9 % in the UK , compared with the same period last year .
this percentage was the fastest and brought in@@ estimates by the time of a interest increase .
the pound rose by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index has an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer by the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .

Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again growth in@@ som@@ ed .
shares of G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E rose 5 % after the mining company said that he took $ 2.5 billion by a block sale as part of his strategy of debt .
the shares of the Packaging und Paper Company MON@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had placed his assessment for the company rating .
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the athletes had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million .
the chief of J@@ D sport says that higher wages increased its expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the bags of the potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it was unlikely that these purchasing power will be the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , and that could mean that there are less additional work@@ places . &quot; &quot; &quot;

potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it &apos;s both - and in the potato chips , the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida Movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat were put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster on a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally in TV .
since then , a barbecue smell turns in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; Al@@ hay means .
the idea of Lebanon now has to be registered in Munich by the Patent Office .
according to the authority , it has been protected as registered designs according to the authority .
but as much as meat and such as potatoes of sk@@ e@@ wer , Al@@ hay wants to betra@@ y us .

met@@ cash starts ground @-@ speed campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of a Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers flow@@ ed has launched a ground @-@ pac@@ ing campaign in order to defend the market share of IG@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US $ al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ als and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen its relations with local food vend@@ ors and build the brand IG@@ A through ma@@ inst@@ ream marketing and marketing via the Social Media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A @-@ tra@@ ders and suppliers have on board with brands such as I@@ eb@@ ie Simm@@ o from Dun@@ s@@ borough , distribut@@ ing in IG@@ A @-@ shops and shop@@ ke@@ epers that sell used tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cash details will be published on September 29th due to the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and equipment to his annual investors strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia util@@ ise almost 30 percent of Met@@ a@@ &apos;s IG@@ A @-@ shops and generate higher profit margin as Met@@ so@@ da IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are a much stronger market share as in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - over 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct how Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two states , and all the actors were present , but mainly independent retailers can take away sales .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley noted that IG@@ A @-@ retailers worldwide could lose 360 million sales per year and a cash cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA over the next year and achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and grocery store and amounts to Met@@ cas@@ at high fixation cost , Met@@ cash could cost about 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ als lost market shares in the Eastern States , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted pol@@ l of Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley is taking up 3.8 percent in the commercial and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share will decrease by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.2 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business office in Melbourne , reported that the cash cash will probably be eliminated within a decade .
the cash out@@ barri@@ ers declined to react publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Met@@ als received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ k &apos;s Food and Food Ret@@ ail , which fell by 43 percent since 2012 , reflec@@ ting the operating debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers lives and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to make sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ u@@ ths with hundreds of products each week to improve and IG@@ A @-@ retailers around improving our shops selling a better selection of private label food products .
Met@@ cas@@ ion &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading programmes will get started at Elan , and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ i deserves praise as cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short@@ est storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and earns his praise to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise for his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; came through the not@@ orious conflict of Cy@@ gios with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y quali@@ fier in Cincinn@@ ati , after that , coconut @-@ kin@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the arbit@@ rators , where Harrison set out : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have been accused , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp ri@@ pped a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing that I would rather en@@ ish myself is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was taken a little into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken up a bat as he lost a cr@@ amp to the US Open , but he is not the first player that has a bat of fru@@ str@@ ation with himself , and I know Than@@ asi is good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but really , he has changed extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative conditions with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too strictly treated .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he doesn &apos;t fit any problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is well in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Cy@@ gios at the key decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ lasting integral component into the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first of all , we desire that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick made very quickly the rise , what people like Feder@@ er and Murray &apos;s eyes , and he is taking part in the eyes of the open , but we try to understand him that he &apos;s just thinking about it , and it &apos;s best to think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for it and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains not@@ ch , closes the border , re@@ tains refugees
Hungary explains the emergency number and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and fulfilled all the time that they tried to stop illegal in the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants came in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land and Serb police with in@@ dig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were hiding for an unknown time in a rural strip on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations climbed on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out acc@@ us@@ ations against Hungarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read@@ iness &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are made from protest foods and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants will return to Hungary for more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ ater@@ ally damage .
in the coming days we have to take talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came after a day after the 28 nations block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels held no common immig@@ ration policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who had taken refuge in the shr@@ unk Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope in the coming month or until the end of the year - an agreement reached that the EU states had another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria wanted a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigrants crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary however , however , did not sit on a bal@@ med action in Brussels or its neigh@@ bors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday @-@ rested emergency in two southern regions authorities made more powers to conquer the crisis so they have been able to speed up roads and asylum proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said in his country that his country also had the construction of a bar@@ bed wire to stop the growing influ@@ x of migrants to the country - after reaching a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata had told that even prison in@@ mates at the race , to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as an input point for the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban said , however , that most of the coming economic refugees are searching for a better life , and not war refugees to provide protection - a view that is strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us who built the government along the southern border to Serbia . those laws also put higher pun@@ ishments for convicted traff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ aid in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : the crossing passage is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;

election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in National survey
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is continuing to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic one at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her to the ground .
Clinton now has support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent previously ) while S@@ anders is second at second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who still has not announced the candidate for the Presi@@ dential Office , receives 15 percent of the elections in the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the pres@@ election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates should support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups that scored some wins .
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moder@@ ates , but these jumps have di@@ min@@ ished .
their support for the males has fallen sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders will be back just 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of democratic voters under the age of 50 has dis@@ si@@ p@@ ated and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
in the past month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now reached a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the elections in the national elections tell him that they would be backed with enthusiasm .... if they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support them with some help and another 15 percent would support them only because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially fascinated by her .
the views are stronger with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just about a quarter would support them .
while 48 per cent of the elections in the Syrian voters want to support the Clinton with enthusiasm , less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters will compl@@ ain about Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman &apos;s President is said ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) will also be mentioned .
agreement to deal with problems and problems are also cited .
because the Vice President th@@ rows the potential for the Presi@@ dential Guard in the guard , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
even more than half that Bi@@ den would say much more than half that Bi@@ den would be much different from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den does not decide to di@@ ct the nom@@ ination of demo@@ c@@ rats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead increases in advance of 20 points with Bi@@ den in race for 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a can@@ did@@ ine with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure declined by 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage of which he sees as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
however , when the question arises , which is more important in a Candi@@ date , Democratic W@@ eller call question about voters .
similar to the last month , no single demo@@ c@@ rat@@ ory candidate or potential candidate for these voters do not appear in@@ acceptable .
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates make good results for some important features when select the party elections .
Bill , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den look as honest and trusted and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts the top three candidates at hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many as they say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
the democratic voters of the pres@@ election also see Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one @-@ quarter of democratic voters no opinion of S@@ anders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since issues of Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server as an Foreign Minister , most Democratic w@@ eller are still satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions did not affect their opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public .
now half of the Americans are un@@ happy with their declaration , while only a third is satisfied .
public opinion for this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion of her even wor@@ sen@@ ed .
they are mainly rep@@ ubli@@ can , more than six of 10 , they say that their views from Clinton are worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of their party , a total of 32 percent is considered to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the elec@@ toral reasons do not keep them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the country &apos;s elec@@ torate considers even Tr@@ ump as not honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good marks on leadership .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush wins best in hon@@ esty .
a majority seemed to be honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic w@@ ron@@ g@@ s in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is approaching in national pol@@ l near Donald Tr@@ ump .
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey by C@@ BS news / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
meanwhile , half of the voters were lost in the new pol@@ l in the meantime , and others fall dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters will continue to support Tr@@ ump in big number . the support is increasing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey which was conducted primarily by Fox News debate in the previous month , 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sh@@ oss from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son finds a good interest in demo@@ graphic groups and is sur@@ passing tr@@ ump with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Kas@@ im , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Governor Scott Walker , who is most profound , namely 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % in the third place .
the error margin in the sample sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was executed in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C pol@@ l that was published last week shows that Car@@ son returns to the pol@@ ls - with 19 % support for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the dump truck with 32 % support .
the most recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a look at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found a side column for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ ze to ask dra@@ ps faith into question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign of campaigns in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant air @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is at present up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing establ@@ ishments are enough to make a trip to the Mediterranean to find even hot water .
a bath in North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
there are no more into the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea that week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares .
at the same time , bath temperatures still offers to the Mediterranean : in the East it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
the Adriatic Sea is located at the top 25 degrees in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood led to the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ing .
nearly two years after a student during a student activ@@ ites in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away , murder was filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood is brut@@ ally attacked and delayed during September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officers said that he had been charged with connected eyes with a 30 pound backpack of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to move over a frozen field on a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he dropped un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to contact D@@ eng@@ s clothing to contact his symptoms and to call Andy Men@@ g , the national President of the Brotherhood , to appeal to Council , &apos; chief Apostle Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; at that point , the members began to hide the utensils , and the good of the Brotherhood , basically by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ chief Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died at his injuries next morning .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g joined together with a bl@@ unt force of injuries to head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh .
&quot; to many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the sh@@ aman , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in a declaration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ h@@ oods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder the third degree for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of gru@@ es@@ ome attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to be responsible for the parties concerned , but if there is an organization that has - officially or un@@ official - this will also apply to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood have re@@ vo@@ iced their belonging to the city group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed raises taxes
a interest rate comes , and the tro@@ se will be gu@@ ised to asc@@ end , and the economy will slip into a recession .
we know this .
what we do not know how long this will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy offers only low guide to the procedure .
a recession came out of only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the rating of the Federal Reserve at the raising of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor involved , like the economy and financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so severely stressed that investors should not concentrate upon when it enters to increase interest rates , rather than the time that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , multiple variables play a role .
however , at the end , market participants could determine that the entire excitement was possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of an interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to Custom@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at low level to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seems to fear many .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here , on historical trends , a look at how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the pre@@ set of interest increases things for a while vol@@ atile .
once the increase applies , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a trend that assets voted for 12 to 24 months after the initial raise , &quot; said German @-@ bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study about what happened after interest rates of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal analysis in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average operating margin in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares ten@@ ds to occur later in the enh@@ ancing cycle and the return on equity will begin to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates support them often .
in the present case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some of the conditions which were not before and which could speed up a recession .
it is remarkable that the gross domestic product is at its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the nominal GDP had only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , only few that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest increases in a so frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have turned the whole year to a interest rate of F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
as many strateg@@ ist and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading are only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all enh@@ ancing cycles of 1950 to day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing the momentum of GDP and on @-@ re@@ pris@@ ons very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is a clear recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed had waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are up to 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ atile , since the market poses an interest rate , and the specimen is quite similar as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic course .
on bonds the R@@ end@@ iten seem to change direction as soon as the first raise / reduction in the cycle is carried out .
at the end of the enh@@ ancing cycle , the bond yields immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab doesn &apos;t believe that the increase in interest rates will bring closer and more recent bonds and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ anal@@ ysts at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it is interesting , Jones thinks that markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation are some signs of inflation adjusted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest they have increased , the contrac@@ tu@@ ally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ lim@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; credit bal@@ ancing has expanded - all features of the market when the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large and whole , companies , who will un@@ roll the larger part of their business activities in the US , will benefit if interest rates climb and local products more attractive .
mult@@ in@@ ational companies with high debts will be po@@ orer , as an asc@@ ending dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares will tend to react positively after three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts ask in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital @-@ yields and low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares outstanding also exceeded their counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , but Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure stock plays , consumers will also benefit through the rising dollars .
savings now could see gains from higher yields , even if experts are different , how quickly it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliamentary member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament c@@ anned member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is causing any commercial ri@@ vals to be distinguished .
he also aims at the BBC Music Awards and told them only The Br@@ its im@@ itated
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Collins grab@@ bed the programme The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do anything the private radio station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ oked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is not to be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; tri@@ um@@ b &quot; - but it seems to be classic FM , &quot; he said .
he is also a@@ iming at the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards announced that last year , The Br@@ its seem to be only among another name .
so , if you try to do something else - this is two spontaneous examples of which you actually have the im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General dismissed the charges and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 runs far from his commercial competitors when it comes to public music and inform@@ ing the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and placing new works in order , and I really think so very important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey has argu@@ ed that harder to engage in the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element in the BBC production which began during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , under fire , to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals to her feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins attacked the Voice - the musical talent Show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producers of Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not very distinctive ?
Lord Hall proved that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Justice - &quot; was produced in a special BBC style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our company &apos;s home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when it was next time an entertainment range . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money in b@@ aller@@ gies to other entertainment formats .
net sales rose by slower in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month the lowest result since the recording was made in the year 2000 .
online sales increased by using mobile phones for sale three years ago
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed its expenses in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping is dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets trans@@ forms into bar@@ ren cities .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online revenue are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure in August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales have stag@@ n@@ ated , after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG St@@ atic index of the Guardian .
he stated that the online sales increased three years ago as a buyer became involved with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that &apos;s a way , and we might experience that the growth is di@@ min@@ ished .
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for decre@@ asing sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , each which will take place last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers will turn around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites sli@@ pped .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fight for bar@@ gains , buyers could take away purchases .
a study by British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases are now conducted via web stores .
at the same time , more than a quarter of the people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the Mo@@ ers in the cities .
Muslims to bury the killed in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims during the first inc@@ lined in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia sets the collapse of part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group on the load
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane has been stor@@ med .
hundreds of Muslims assembled themselves , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the ones who were killed , when a crane reached Mec@@ ca Gros@@ mo@@ sch@@ ees .
sw@@ inging , mostly dressed in white , the stretch to delic@@ acy their respect , when the first of the dead appeared to take their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ oh@@ m cemetery .
the fun@@ eral took over at the Holy Sites , where there was only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the Mos@@ que and then fell on the streets .
the bodies were released for the bur@@ ial , when the Saudi King over the construction company Bin Laden was caused by the disaster that made 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 victims , who were killed , being a crane by the Great Central District of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
in the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ash@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , had been a father of four children who fell on his first pilgrimage .
Mr Vas@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch .
Saudi Arabia has already said that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca will continue to come back to town with thousands of people going to the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group would not have managed the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Arabic version of the Dec@@ ree , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the message of the news agency reported that detail , however , said that the company &apos;s leadership must be banned from abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man revealed to reveal what the overthrow of the crane caused the overthrow of the crane , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to front of the H@@ add@@ g , which later gathered in this month .
the Bin Laden group has not given any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available to a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also provided the group because of un@@ current security measures , because they do not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround the Mec@@ ca Gros@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , managed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the death of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a late son who has been dis@@ gu@@ ised by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in a strong winds and rain , a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which at least once in the life of each healthy food is required .
officials said that 158 people will stay in the hospital .
government officials meet that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries .
other injured are the half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says , that the period of cheap East German art@@ is@@ ans is over
Britain became increasingly tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled art@@ is@@ ans from Eastern Europe was rising behind
this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which aim for tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened .
also close to King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Sales Exhibition nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its will carry out its hamm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ people who perform working in their home
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to suit the walls , you don &apos;t belong to a minority .
because the British employ more craftsmen to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ reinforced chain , said that a big rise in the number of skilled art@@ is@@ ans from Eastern Europe had to offer low prices for low prices .
it is therefore plans to open King@@ fis@@ her , 200 more scre@@ enings shops to close up art@@ is@@ ans and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , for eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are taken by women .
at the moment , men weigh their men .
she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends that take more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores .
we must shift this stronger to equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
in general , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women listed on the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also structured their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has seized 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher gave a decline in semi @-@ annual profit and sales , after the group has been acc@@ ust@@ omed the costs for closing the shops .
King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , is planning to open 200 new branches .

according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the accused were disper@@ sed in the years 2006 to 2011 that they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions and used for private purposes .
he has damaged the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sport facilities are also charged with financial rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was the president of the bill , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
the def@@ ens@@ ity seized control of the def@@ ens@@ ity , in fact , at no point of asset to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sport func@@ tionary should have been pursued and the sports club , which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , where they had invested a lot of time and money , from the debt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pas@@ si@@ va was given around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illings ( approx . 44@@ ,000 Euros ) in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we continue to drive or lock up the club ? , &quot; one of the accused , told in a sandwich service of the financial department .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shed money , which swe@@ pt away our life insurance as security at the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the entry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it has been agreed : you can use the money freely , there must be no debts .
furthermore , during the financial success , the payout of the allowance was taken back by 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance was only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when an increase had been on account , paid off .
thus , l@@ ump @-@ and @-@ detailed bookings also appeared , explained the former ob@@ sessions .
the accounts and savings managed the two accused together , said the second accused .
why the association funds were not exposed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisation didn &apos;t care in detail for financial support , important to the debt only , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , when a func@@ tionary investig@@ ating the function of counter@@ parts began in 2011 , the amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account .
these were backs , declared the accused .
this bank account was set up in the name of the second accused and was not known according to the organisation .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
Wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on I knew not a reply .
then he thought he said he believed that this was the best for our organisation .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the public prosec@@ utor dropped into space .
the co @-@ accused was informed , the func@@ tionary of being func@@ tionary .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; dam@@ aging &quot; claim .
why are loss of damage ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
and the first def@@ endant was told that he would not agree with this wording , because the association was never a damage to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all from Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a deputy . &quot; he asked .
he said the func@@ tionary , he never obtained a p@@ enny salary , and he only endor@@ sed sail@@ or money and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he has put in charge of the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort , however , was much higher , added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
these were according to a working trial , where everything has been judged correctly , no longer were kept , declared it .
mil@@ eage is also related to the second accused .
all the surveys have been made in cash , in addition he had to leave international youth markets for lead to P@@ hab@@ burg , he explained in his asser@@ tion .
the trial continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard presents other 30.000 jobs
in addition to the operating breakdown of the Company , the computer reduction will expand further jobs during the expansion of the Company for three years .
the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fying Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) is no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to reduce the di@@ str@@ ation of 25,000 up to 30,000 jobs in its corporate design .
as a result , the cost of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , the company shared the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion that will be launched from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed since three years .
HP had still approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year .
thus , the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ stock was 2.3 percent .
the large @-@ format printers from California Palo Alto are currently aged on : in this way , the computer and printing shop shall be bund@@ led even today in a new company - separate from the advanced areas of computer servers and data stores for companies as well as other services .
both companies are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another disappo@@ inting PC section as well as a weaker demand for corporate clients after his services was recently the second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to nearly EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
the revenues went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a split and massive closing of the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded to customers to increase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers to buy and do more and more stores right away .
Whit@@ man restructuring plans en@@ comp@@ assing the total breakdown of roughly 55@@ ,000 positions .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent crimes in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took place at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and occup@@ ying several hundred refugees in the Serbian border .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent attempt at the border control point .
he told us :
a group of refugees cut through the border .
behind it , a polic@@ eman took place and behind the polic@@ emen was ready for a ro@@ wer .
40 to 50 fu@@ g@@ iti@@ ves began with stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials .
the officers were shot in the first pepper spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was contra@@ cted in the direction of refugees .
the group was thus dissolved .
the refugees have now re@@ dra@@ gged something back .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children , who had met the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried out .
other refugees bl@@ asted in themselves and suffered under respir@@ atory exchange .
the press conferences of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of lac@@ tation and pepper spray .
time of decision about interest rates for US notation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world ob@@ serves two days , when the U.S. emergency is coming together on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether the first time has been raised to interest for almost a decade or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists found by Reuters , found out that a little more than half of the fact that F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will still wait any longer and keep interest rates on the current stand of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it &apos;s a historic event , because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest earned on NULL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach to a situation where a large central bank may start the zero field and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ coating , Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ qu@@ ed outlook on global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets ; however , the signs indicate that the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision to be released at 20.00 a.m. CET on Thursday
death @-@ akes at the Delta State University post@@ pon@@ ed path@@ ology
&quot; &quot; &quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague and killed Sh@@ annon Lamb a note to say that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted to make it happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he had shot on someone , and someone killed .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency department , that police ref@@ uses to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but it will not distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably ex@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in@@ quired of the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ er@@ iss , 41 , and a written note from Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the notice , Lamb rose 300 miles from the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police squ@@ ashed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ be@@ ard said he kno@@ cks nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday the Lamb believed that Pr@@ ent@@ hot had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there &apos;s no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ angular Rel@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ er@@ iss has been described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she was married about seven years as a &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Mar@@ en said he and Pr@@ er@@ iss have had a daughter who is 19 and it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pom@@ p@@ iss worked online from home , according to the statement of Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , that was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les told that Pr@@ er@@ iss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb opened one certain time on Monday to say to them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers took him in the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in that night , Lamb rose from his car to the side , fled to the forest and killing himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctorate in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University as a PhD student at the University of Bielefeld University .
stars that have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , did some stress .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor was also accused of fighting drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug candidates .
all this certainly calls his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group um
Lufthansa is planning a large group of corporate restructuring .
in one year , the Lufthansa group wants to save a billion @-@ billion euros in a better organization .
the Group &apos;s workforce of 150 is responsible for restructuring in the world .
with the pilot @-@ union , there are in the new negotiations .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheaper Euro@@ wings .
the aim of real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of about € 500 million per year from cost and rede@@ em@@ sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline distributed the company on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no responsibility for the passenger business in Lufthansa .
the Euro@@ wings cost airline is as autonomous as possible as possible .
in the Executive Board , CEO Carsten Sp@@ o@@ hr , in future , Karl Ulrich Garn@@ adt will be in charge of Euro@@ wings .
with the new setting , Sp@@ o@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the Airline airline operated under the airline &apos;s roof which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new talks with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff of the pilot Association ( VC ) , negotiations with the pilot Association ( VC ) are scheduled to be res@@ umed on this Thursday .
this shared the union with .
the topic of talks will be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year , cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come as fast as possible results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline has led to several strikes in recent months .
background is the pilot concept &quot; Wings &quot; next to the trans@@ itional government .
it is noticeable that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors have gone down to the Euro@@ wings Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgen@@ land to the South &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger in the artist &apos;s home . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play for double fra@@ cture for months
the Champions League of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven suffered a double correction of his right one at the Champions League Cup in Manchester .
while this left the left outer def@@ enders to tears , and finish it for at least six months of play , Louis van G@@ aal inst@@ alls the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season again .
the violation was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated at the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being admitted to hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg , and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transfer@@ ed tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United comes very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the dressing cabin he had a oxygen massage on .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , the six months , and he will not play in the group stage .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a El@@ f@@ Meter .
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , hasn &apos;t punished the Mexican .
van G@@ aal susp@@ ects that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself , if I say that a el@@ y@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a twe@@ et at Sha@@ ws account heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you for your messages . words can &apos;t describe what broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I will come back stronger again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
referred to as : Manchester United also suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of PS@@ V
the England defender of the United Kingdom has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover by the upcoming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves this kind of injury to the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention to harm our players , to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg breaking in Mexico against Van Ga@@ as in 2014 during World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that there is a very serious injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it wasn &apos;t possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult to be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a cou@@ gh of Chris Sm@@ aller .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided on the Environmental Committee of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I would like to give my kids a picture or a message that we missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all well and good , except that the following paragraph , in the Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , gives a sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis of the 2012 movie version , adding the new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; amid@@ st the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commod@@ ity , it is hoping to capture a real tree , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ unds , and who died in 1991 , is completely unknown .
as if it wasn &apos;t yet susp@@ icious , the text by Cameron proved , is partly - the summary of the W@@ need @-@ movie , who is syn@@ onymous with the website of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hoping to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he agre@@ es to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems im@@ per@@ ative that Cameron stands out the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ named boy , despite the protests of the well @-@ named Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ ving that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the name of the trees &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; will be devast@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing Street speaker , said that the text had probably come from the election cycle .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text of the Camer@@ o@@ Is were delivered , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was definitely threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s squ@@ ad , but it &apos;s still hard
to to@@ ast Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when you have selected the fa@@ der , the England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test program does not have on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de an upwards victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks Site is probably less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the spirit of the community is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een has developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on Test @-@ Level , an option for the attack .
referring to this : Adam Ly@@ th is eliminated from the England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire , difficult to analyze .
in its seven tests , there were two good attacks among difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that thr@@ illers are orient@@ ated on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said that - players are their own best selection .
long time ago , we would have extended the run of Ly@@ th but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully sp@@ ends other runs for Yorkshire , another chance will come .
the England Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss continued his attitude even if he did not have such good benefits , and that surprises me not ; he is especially a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test script will get to reset his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only disc@@ ard that you could rise was that England first placed Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - but this lost chance now is in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a stroke that I guess .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ e@@ er , what we saw at Yorkshire in this season when he made 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which very met us .
he must be at least the same chances as they get before him , but of course it depends on World division representation in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of bringing Mo@@ een beside Cook , bring about an extra @-@ spin @-@ bow@@ ler and four Qu@@ icks would get up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he &apos;s a devil &apos;s smo@@ ker &apos;s cri@@ cket .
Mo@@ een may not have his job done for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is also a number 3 for them , and there is no major difference there .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ signs immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the fa@@ der than back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - on an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few clever supplements at coaching .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ ze@@ f , the civil man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the trial could be a master@@ piece .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , which is an abundance of experience , since he played in all terms and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the dressing cabin , even if the news are in line with the previously sent .
col@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at One @-@ Day@@ er , R@@ oot bought a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this .
some may not agree , but Co@@ aches and team actors do not determine the timet@@ able .
and you must remember , as if players want to depend on their jobs by the players .
such decisions are not easy .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = export of France from the EU ) could gain a subsi@@ dy when the economy runs into a dol@@ drums until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented re @-@ trial strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n as leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , was severely dist@@ ressed for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at fre@@ es recently said that some member states , as deeply tra@@ pped in various crises , like the EU it is now and not always from own gu@@ ilt , Great Britain itself created agenda with continued conc@@ essions and dis@@ rup@@ tive changes that they usually do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , it may not be able to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the social protection .
we could also tell Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and Finance Affairs on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign countries will make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local size , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wishes to look after the outside of the EU @-@ tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ate us not only with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and leaves us that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials came to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is one ally but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for it , as it did for the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can be proud of his re @-@ election or his creation in 2017 .
he is also an abandoned power .
perhaps Poland could soon be a nation@@ alist right government , Spain one left .
it is difficult to imagine that they get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better for it , from the UK &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they do not want , because most of the similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ den@@ cies have .
therefore , perhaps some such ministers take some un@@ helpful comments , quite in SN@@ P &apos;s style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums to speed up the Bre@@ xit process is suspected of my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ trial was a Ple@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Great Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has won no value from the new negoti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how to get to Fle@@ et Street on their own expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of press bar@@ ons , but did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who did not support our entry in 1973 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opport@@ un@@ ities , who made a name for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ ies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at all his de@@ gl@@ iness , Ed Mili@@ band knew , who were his enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ pon@@ ies , phone @-@ hack@@ ing countries and the p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ inhibit@@ ors belong to most of our major newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about her , but it noted that when one sits comfortably ban@@ anas with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , to give it a better ban@@ anas to give it , instead of lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mili@@ band had more Bl@@ air himself as a Bl@@ air himself , as he opposed the speech of speech , because Bl@@ air had refused to say the principle of the EU adopted by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he doesn &apos;t need time for me to f@@ use me - seems to repeat no time for me , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yc@@ ott Mur@@ doch . a mistake at that time and today .
it can last but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n is the official position in Europe - I &apos;ll get it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people out of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ur trend and wild bones of sat@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say Yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ ns had been an appointment of pro@@ prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a rat @-@ w@@ aged a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it rem@@ inded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father embar@@ ked on television , loyal to his Labour @-@ cabinet attacks , without going too far and lose his cabinet .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was still more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expressed - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said what J@@ C told his comra@@ des and de@@ pu@@ ties following all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touching picture @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to con@@ vey @-@ up , remember that he even has anno@@ yed me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no freedom for Europe allowing him to keep lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ end@@ ums for self @-@ under@@ stand@@ ably , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental uni@@ qu@@ ities at EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ow @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist era , is not just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of little lower is a central principle of dog@@ matic cont@@ en@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ties to Nato - Tom Watson , you won &apos;t be convinced that J@@ C will not be required for the exit - become foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find in everything a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin have lost political capital - they have mis@@ susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be po@@ int@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government , what I did when on Monday was something of the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise the Public Health England report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a government financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes have been reduced as smoking for a meeting of 12 persons , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et by critic@@ izing the evidence of Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in its report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes him as a comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have turned the capacity of the data to be addressed and directed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the Lanc@@ et medical journal of the last month &apos; The extra@@ ordin@@ arily de@@ formed basis , &quot; based on the P@@ he its most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other scientists write to BM@@ J and we asked whether the claims were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes should be about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of copy@@ rights and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement consists of a single meeting of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions about the damage of various nic@@ otine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health had been the managing director of British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , told them .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding they have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for choosing the members of the Gre@@ xit would not be delivered but also include several known E @-@ cigarettes @-@ Champions , some of which specify also a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco leading of the P@@ he took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symbo@@ liz@@ ing the Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products for most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , any of these connections or limitations in the P@@ he report will be discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he &apos;s claims that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J has already re@@ acted on the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all the evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are low , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique obligation to information the public@@ ity about what evidence shows and what do not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative risks compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0.000 people die yearly in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ a year .
through clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The BBC should stop using programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would give their right arm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for sm@@ ash shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fees should only be used to make kinds of programs not be sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ized the BBC to publicly chose public law programs which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and stations such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to come in touch with Channel 4 during his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs is on behalf , or sends them clearly from non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson reported to the top communication committee on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , don &apos;t care what I don &apos;t want average or in the long term , you should be able to put at least on programs that do not place or order .
they send The Voice in a first class window , because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would do their right arm for this .
I will ende@@ av@@ our to see how this will be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that the BBC would decrease .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC to blame for reviews is &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of the people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of BBC , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , proposed that the BBC shows how to sell the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that they should go to BB@@ C4 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public @-@ legal agen@@ das , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they carry out their duties , and they can ar@@ gue if they go on their apparent missions to just@@ ify a £ 4 billion radio station , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , obviously , we have seen all these above programs that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lay them in a time window where nobody wanted to see her ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the radio broadcast Johnson test@@ ified to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ur@@ ge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system with respect to conditions , who can get the best value . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of you think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who test@@ ified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC will check out its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain the BBC i@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , just little from BBC &apos;s production now officially classified as education - he said that there should be 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and she should take part in the public @-@ legal television sen@@ ders in Australia and Canada , and we should inform and talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC ought to do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television is shown , and with the commercial stations Alli@@ ances to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ esis &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment in which it will be bl@@ asted with sound effects .
scientists have produced wor@@ ms of genet@@ ically modified nervous system that can be controlled by qu@@ arri@@ es of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the instant they have heard with sound effects that are used for the human ear hearing , to be shot pe@@ ened .
the im@@ pulses work by switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that can be genet@@ ically modified to handle the membrane channels that react on ultr@@ asonic waves .
another topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ ogenic etics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Srebrenica &apos;s chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive method that gives electric im@@ pulses to the treatment of the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ stran@@ mer normally does not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani showed that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which penet@@ rate into wor@@ ms .
the increased ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures containing TR@@ P @-@ 4 hist@@ ori@@ ans and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the saus@@ ages .
the sound waves act through the opening of these I@@ onic channels and activ@@ ates the cells they are assigned , as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified organisms that carry some of their Mot@@ ives TR@@ P @-@ 4 icons .
when compar@@ ing ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ organisms and transferred into wor@@ ms , where they can turn the modified mot@@ i@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to activate and switch neur@@ ons with light im@@ pulses .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be revealed on an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ rate ultr@@ asonic tissue can be di@@ v@@ indicated and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , added .

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence for 19 years , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , but now I remember the ten@@ sion@@ ed smile that I have sc@@ and@@ alized - and to the numerous , bo@@ xed complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the train in a student dormitories ranges from easily ner@@ ven@@ ous up to absolute sc@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people tell whence com@@ est , if and where you have taken up to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a He@@ fe@@ extra@@ kt ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe out through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conversation and helps you to find out the people who like you may not speak with whom you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your lashes are in fire and these fire extingu@@ isher could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people allow people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks @-@ rec@@ tions , film night venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people attract and sp@@ atter@@ ing their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not forget to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted a rough treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student residence form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ bum@@ ble@@ bee @-@ culture that can lead friendly and soci@@ ally to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture enables you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship but you have to leave the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trying to feel when a Com@@ mit@@ ig@@ one is exhausted by soci@@ alizing a ghost - and send it an SMS instead of to kno@@ ck .
speaking of Par@@ ap@@ rop@@ os : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship complete through baking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as you start the university on the climax of the back mania , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to prevent himself with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I just smile when I give you a few personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
homemade treats offer is a good way to close friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ate is obliged to enter@@ tain himself and will associate your face with a tasty surprise .
of course , it depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly merged cl@@ ump , made of flour , sugar and fat , people do sleeping for sleeping .
there is one common crime in student residence halls .
sure , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea too ?
check this with the dairy plant .
chances are that they say to use yourself , even if cooking them inside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one ste@@ als your bel@@ lows , this is anno@@ ying , and you have my sympathy , but try to treat more balanced than my ro@@ omm@@ ate , who put a dish@@ erg@@ ent in its milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise taking away from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not only about being a decent person , but that you belong in the sense of pro@@ ver@@ ts to the people who sit in the greenhouse .
a girl on my corridor asked her neigh@@ bors , if it makes them something out , drum &amp; bass has somewhat qui@@ eter because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even l@@ ur@@ king music .
when she finally woke up at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbor still two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and ended up to her three @-@ hour test .
if your future ouse would like to be drawn randomly to the same student residence ?
vice versa , it would not be terri@@ bly embar@@ rass@@ ing when you take a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future wife , to be able to separate themselves , and to see them every day , and perhaps witnessed how to bring together all our common friends ?
of course , your heart is doing its own way - but if another ro@@ omm@@ ate is not your future wife , so try to talk a little reason to you .
in an exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his key in his un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing seems as it seems .
a good trick is fun , but it takes only moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
make disc@@ lose a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never fail to know someone &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and shampoo .
close your door , and place their keys into a glass of water , which you will then place in the freezer - but give their owners close to the ceiling more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , single @-@ formation , rotary mer@@ it
the real estate business Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building a central square ter@@ raced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but just as the alone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ isc@@ ule &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am showing how you can still build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees will be pushing for the housing estate .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly the favourable space can be created : it builds for refugees in a project .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the housing estate .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the massive accommodation in containers or turn@@ tables has no sustainability .
for people stay too large part here .
given the refugee flow we need to have enough living space in the coming decades .
a very common , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a ter@@ raced house takes the least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if you under@@ scores the people in residential blocks .
each of the six houses built just in the pilot project consists of three units of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees are saying , it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then houses can be re@@ constructed according to respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
g@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meter floor space per house tot@@ aled € 184 000 , excluding land .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is reasonable .
have the constructions complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have moved my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it the imp@@ ending women @-@ les@@ bian special construction and positi@@ onal order .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ taking , who in a town house creates three apartments , needs at least three plots .
only in the cities l@@ acks the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did local residents respond to their ri@@ pen@@ sions project ?
g@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not correct .
but do not waste your competitors for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a phase of construction in Germany , but were built in luxury apartments which can barely afford any more .
my project also has the message and normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the educ@@ ating mother or the scent agencies .
I am showing how to get comfortably and well build .
that &apos;s why it is .

if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some are encounter@@ ed after installation , as they get an error message indic@@ ating that the &quot; software update has failed . &quot;
in order to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update through iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean the del@@ etion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do this if you use a special tool , to delete apps and install it ane@@ w once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update , or is located near a charging station , so that the battery is charged .
when the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to go on , as the phone might turn on hal@@ f@@ way , and this could lead to a crash .

Dr. Frank Müller continues to work in practice and invested 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen .
also , Sam@@ t@@ former mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Minister of Economy in Uta S@@ eim @-@ Schw@@ artz and As@@ endor@@ fs , mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country , Doc@@ endorf are missing in the future : Dr. Frank Müller on October 1 takes the practice of the field .
while the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is reti@@ ring into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich assumes his successor in the coming months still half a place to go .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy to the first sight when the Fel@@ se@@ ys had been met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who is currently taking place in practice in the hospital , which is currently planning to rise in practice this year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mül@@ lers should fit nicely in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when I was so far , I simply called them . &quot;
the idea of the couple of Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss .
and so one got agree that the Mül@@ lers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to be accommod@@ ated in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , in his medical studies in Hannover , followed by stations in several doctor &apos;s offices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg , and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a Consult@@ ant in Sul@@ ingen as a Consult@@ ant in Sul@@ ph@@ ingen in 2009 , and is engaged in honorary positions in the DRC @-@ will@@ ing@@ ness of Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ sen@@ ausen as a physician , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) speci@@ alizes in the Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mül@@ lers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , do not want to settle down as household in@@ arians .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion the rooms are modern look .
we will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ GS and need a consultation room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a supplement of € 500@@ 00 will receive the Mül@@ lers in the framework of a funding programme of the Land@@ kreis ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality of the municipality ( 12,@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; it shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice continues to be continued , &quot; emphas@@ izes Sam@@ t@@ ell@@ y@@ ph@@ er Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter in the practice they come into practice , in the North German average clinic , there are about 500 patients .
in As@@ endorf there is another family practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy stays according to the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have found , it would also have gone .
he who visits m@@ iller &apos;s hours , look at it mainly in familiar faces : he will take over the seven medical experts and the cleaning of the field .
after part@@ ing with their leave in As@@ endorf , after all , the medicine has practic@@ ed there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen noted .
they feel a little wor@@ m@@ wood after the long time .
&quot; but we don &apos;t live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or in Hohen@@ mo@@ or so many patients are still seen often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband adds l@@ ach@@ ting : &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before garden work , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , the couple enjoyed two grand@@ son and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls went up to our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are retained in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as before is clear , everyone who wants to make a asylum request do this also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people are fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs strong signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less migration , nor the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
previously , the Croatian government had told that Slovenia wants to travel further refugees to Austria and Germany , and under circumstances also cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees er@@ ect .
this is the case that the Minister of Defence was Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia is rather the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled by the Schengen area .
as the Minister has stressed , Sloven@@ e will not work out its limits for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member has to complete its comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system can &apos;t work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government took hur@@ ried , the first refugees had already attemp@@ ted to go to Tuesday in Ost@@ c@@ roati@@ a at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police over@@ sees them in the near Ma@@ is@@ fields .
according to local media , police cars ever met with new refugees in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afghan , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and Red Cross are also already in use .
in the coming days his country with more than 4,000 refugees , Minister of the Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo were transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border which had previously linked to the Hungarian border , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it would be wise to propose the people telling certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the early morning , a first bus with around 50 migrants arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ id , during the day further buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria
the occup@@ ants were located all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border crossing a distance of about 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has made it , so the police told us that we should come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that now to some observ@@ ations of the hi@@ ther@@ to earlier Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Serbia , it could now come to a little further west . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; extensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously st@@ resses that his country for the case of a strong condition of refugees prepared for possible exception situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not name he , but he pointed out that Croatia &apos;s non @-@ Schengen recru@@ iting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options to border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ en@@ gen@@ room .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , with the EU partners through this way through a good testimony of what concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der Media we have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border transfers are to remain closed in Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g .
whether the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to calm on Wednesday at a local he@@ dge in Hor@@ gos : keeping the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not have been very high by very high number of refugees .
you can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia , or any other country .
hel@@ pers advise Mig@@ rants - Dangerous - Alternative rou@@ ters
however , private Hungarian migrant workers have already begun to distribute to the refugees of land maps , in which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not un@@ safe : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict still un@@ cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine @-@ mining was sent in the border region .

with the explo@@ ited information , in@@ sider shops should be on financial markets .
in this way , investig@@ ators have moved into a total of over $ 100 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the people do their der@@ or@@ tions , partly fast pac@@ es@@ cent , partly cozy .

the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ ice made aware of this action on its 20 @-@ year existence and looks quite confron@@ ted with mixed responses .
&quot; it is about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; said Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer .
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ as is available to the p@@ asser@@ s as well as for questions and convers@@ ations as volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while man@@ ch attacks a passport spontaneous with a chal@@ k , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can stop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stay , say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how far I &apos;m not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and go further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever again , on the edge of small discussions on the action , more about life , dealing with death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is right on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear that for me sometimes the end of this world , I cannot live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal mill of Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 year @-@ old was good .
that not everybody wants to share openly on the tablets , be under@@ stand@@ able , finally , it is a very personal thing .
death and death may be subject to tab@@ oos , as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer , although the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer , although much has contributed much in recent years , that people have to open .

fic@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 cut lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disappo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant restra@@ ined his outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his land transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ .000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers .
the stock exchange fell by over 2.5 per cent at market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 € in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
anal@@ ysts expected to expect a pol@@ l of $ 10,@@ 84 .
the lower prosp@@ ect is , despite the price increases , which are at an average of 4.9 percent , and despite higher rates for land transport of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that it is still expecting to increase the outcome from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income , and growth in online trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has strengthened &quot; solid income when they are weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than the ri@@ val UPS announced , the plant plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex was 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked anal@@ ysts predi@@ ctions .
sales increased by 5 percent to CHF 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the acks were anal@@ ysts expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has caused a decline to the international priority shipping , which stag@@ n@@ ated sales in its unit express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping successfully increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex .
during the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat for higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher rates , while the result was falling due to higher operating costs in the cargo business .
in market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .

the central bank has a double order from the Congress : Maxim@@ izing the US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the major recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged a third and third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too tight to predi@@ ct them . it is announced on Thursday that the U.S. economy is ready to become off by the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most data of the economy show it soli@@ dly grows , the latest turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the far more careful F@@ ed representative to increase this volume of interest for federal bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing that they see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Che@@ f@@ economics in the bro@@ ler@@ ship Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text they were not able to raise the interest rate , the increased in@@ security is sufficient for the global market enough to maintain , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed will do is un@@ sure in itself the finance market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently asked about Bloom@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial markets , however , await the F@@ ed , with a key indic@@ ative that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this indicates a decline of the stock market , if F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless its strateg@@ ist may sm@@ ate the blow , by saying that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ ages increased 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy believes the sentence in this week said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts have argu@@ ed that a interest rate would calm the financial markets , because it would cause un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act .
still a month before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow decline of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that they would be required this year despite the complaints of Liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest since more than seven years , and near the level , which sh@@ ed as full employment .
wage increases have demonstrated signs of recovery .
and although the inflation rate ran steadily under the previous target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension to the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Shepher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets all over the world began at the end of last month , after China had dev@@ alu@@ ed its currency .
Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by over 16 % in May by more than 16 % among its maximum , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in China would supply global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , the Dow Automotive is now risen by almost 10 % below the beginning of May .
for the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when one should raise the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events were not occurred on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last couple of weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of U.S. emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that they are waiting for at least one month in order to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economy is none of the fundamental values of the F@@ ed , so it should be included technically in their decision @-@ making .
however , in the end effect the F@@ ed currency department of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere clu@@ e of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abandoned con@@ fu@@ sions around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly un@@ covered , they can only monitor the developments at other locations , but also consult with other central banks and experts to ensure a better understanding of global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more Art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has found a story of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements , which apparently do not appear bound with the economic Fund@@ am@@ ental data . &quot;
co@@ ater , atmosph@@ eric member of the Federal Open Market Committee , stated for a interest of interest , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its leader for 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite unlimited implic@@ ations effects on growth in the U.S. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said lacquer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives broke these cuts .
F@@ ed should only place Asp@@ ects of the financial stability only during a severe crisis , like market heav@@ al in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee on the Tax Directive of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il won &apos;t come near to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly you don &apos;t want to get into the situation , because they are afraid of a interest rate because the markets came out &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think they should wait at times .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life support for refugees
more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
preparing them to prepare a warm welcome , not without the engagement of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with her body and soul teacher .
she has also always liked to teach her 74 Len@@ zen .
every Thursday she does it in asylum seek@@ ers along the D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .
there it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course it &apos;s different lessons than at a proper school .
Brazilian and Pedi@@ at@@ ric Association Rio Grande fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the SP@@ RS Brazilian elite organization tries to clari@@ fy women about how important food during feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of protein , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies are giving all the nutrients you need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase daily calories consumed by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results showed that a higher cal@@ ory consumption did not make the only di@@ et@@ ical adap@@ tion that should carry mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet did actually affect the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , the child &apos;s healthy eating can influence the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ bar Sports Hall
the municipal office of Bern@@ ard@@ son approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros sport hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof is to be flat to solar thermal installations .
the plant@@ ations for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gym construction work step by step : in the recent municipal council session , the elabor@@ ated construction request has been un@@ fore@@ seen without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , the panel had decided to apply for an application on a statutory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respectively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid plans plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission to create a special form regarding the roof construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle with non @-@ chief first and roof super@@ nat@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the purpose of planning , the planned use of the roof space for solar systems : &quot; in this way , we get a wonderful big South roof , &quot; explained by Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , it was in turn to the roof of energetic reasons - different from the planning plan - below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is considerably reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction does not allow@@ able as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with the am@@ ber of the council in the rule of liberation efforts rather restri@@ c@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is no recur@@ ring project in the turn@@ key : &quot; we do not create a prec@@ ed@@ case , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym construction at the sports center is a community project of the community and SV Bern@@ ward .
at costs around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
grants are expected from the school and lat@@ itude promotion .
in the next step the building application for the 18 x 36 meters of hall is now submitted to the governor and to the exam .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this clearly shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Land@@ kreis , confirmed the Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , a decision on this will be the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , all the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be moved with Fischer and the existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the spaces are present .
the co @-@ workers who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au is to be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , as well as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the change of termination by Dr Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and is now focusing on a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the question of who will succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into the game , which was ready to take over and change over his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au from 1 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any event the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au means that in any event a &quot; dev@@ alu@@ ation &quot; and an area of services in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
col@@ loqui@@ ally for the next two years is a fisher@@ man with his team , if the supervisory board is true , both houses lead until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ella , which has yet more than 35 beds , will be finally closed at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg in nearly 140 years .
previously , the county has planned this for 2018 , when the ongoing renovation is completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
&quot; Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the chairman of the Supervisory Board , has stood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ ours &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is in the property of the federal government , in future as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s what I closed . &quot; as it continues with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say it &apos;s several consider@@ ations .
there are currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sych@@ iat@@ ric .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such a opportunity does not come back , &quot; so Fischer has been taken over the Qu@@ asi years to the Le@@ ch , who had been accepted by the employees &quot; positive and very under@@ stand@@ able . &quot;
a real perspective for the house where the fisher@@ man has been working as chief physician for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the position of the medical director .
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been repeatedly threatened with closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed , who killed young people and put their body into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate was missing on Saturday . violence has fallen victim to a victim .
the dead bodies of the young woman was found on Tuesday night in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern as well as the prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
as a result , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who had in fact claimed the statement , and investig@@ ators took the place of discovery .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning , after having arrived at home on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of a young woman , the investig@@ ators initially strug@@ gled for personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in case of awareness of friends , the circle of events eventually revealed itself to a crime against the 20 year old .
the alleged perpet@@ rators took the police on a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
the arrested gave the authorities to inter@@ fere in police f@@ ake , which killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the body into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be for@@ ged at the port of the harbour , the investig@@ ators bring him a burden to him .

refugees need accommodations : study warns of homes
the situation on the German residential community is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a paid lead .
the printing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution works on German residential community has long since begun .
with the coming refugees and unemployed coming from the EU , more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for paid housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
to this result , a study is conducted on behalf of the alliance of social housing . &quot;
for comparison : this year 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
with it 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated for the first three months of their stay as asylum seek@@ ers live in an emergency housing .
many pic@@ to@@ es in the residential market and lined up in the long queu@@ es before the rental apartments .
according to Statist@@ ic Bundes@@ amt , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing markets is not only for the rising number of refugees .
the study also represents substantial om@@ is@@ sions in residential construction policy of the past years .
Germany will be shooting a housing deficit , which will grow from year to year .
currently in the metrop@@ olitan areas about 77@@ 0.000 homes were lacking , Matthias Günther , writer of the study .
therefore , many professionals lived in urban not@@ ions in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ sur@@ rendered to the &quot; Hotel Mama , &quot; because of the fl@@ au@@ ditions in the apartment market .
in the cities , the number of square metres per head has fallen back for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the Cl@@ an &quot; Alliance proposes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves should boost the social housing back .
thus , the property taxes could be abandoned and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments may be suspended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the alliance , it must be shel@@ tered attractive tax de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W Kf@@ W is now well at cities and cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start was rec@@ alled by 184 million Euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the project could even be thr@@ illed .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia are the hall@@ way
more than Hungary is practically unnecessary , there are more refugees on the way across Croatia .
Zagreb announces the passing of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les to leave .
the route still is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia over the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slovenian Interior Minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after sealing off the Serbian border , hundreds of refugees escap@@ es to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV RTL in RTL .
Hungary had blocked off its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , do virtually unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police launched the first refugees at the Serbian border with Serbia &apos;s neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to the most recent media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and Tax@@ es in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
directly after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia .
along the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not slo@@ gan@@ ied on the fence .
in this point , the border crossing other dangers : there are sharp mines coming from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ de@@ mining companies should now create a secure passage .
after Hungary , after the closing of the border , no more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police released a challenged people .
shortly before the closing on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the over@@ coming and dam@@ aging the border dispute as an off@@ ense .
in the south Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the convicted prisoners rest for up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authority one , a total of 94 asylum applications have been met in the newly appointed &quot; Trans@@ ni@@ ons &quot; in total , of which nearly all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there was still 40 refugees to be stopped .
however , no one has granted any chance to receive asylum in Hungary .
after a Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers should go down there .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ ni@@ ons &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke a few hundred refugees assembled .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to tidy .
they collected the tr@@ ash , ten thousands of people left behind the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
plywood panels were dismant@@ led and one of the recording sessions was rebuilt at the bound@@ ary .
nobody wanted to out@@ live this re@@ building .
Austria has only a few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also intensi@@ fied its border controls .
but to the 20,000 migrants , however , government figures pleaded not yet in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the further drive to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
located in Freil@@ assing , numerous groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
Mayor drove &quot; Gest@@ alt@@ ed &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were standing after the bridge on Sunday with the insur@@ rection , when ten people stood with travel guides at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists wanted to go to Passau with the train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany had stopped off on Sunday , however , because of the refugee flow in Austria , it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ stein conclusion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately attracted his aid and the stran@@ ded along the border to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na@@ he Passau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before that , we had the un@@ thought guests only verk@@ öst@@ igt with prayers and drinks .
we said the same way , we will bring them back to Passau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take it to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that was very pleased , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded towing pass@@ ag@@ iere went up in Wels from a ICE train in Wels to a regional train in the direction of Passau , at the short notice of the notice that the railway was stopped after Germany , but still trying to try crossing the border .
the regional train was placed on the river Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein at the river Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally highly concentrated in the course .
the bridge team connected to the Bavarian neighbours in Sunday , before a two @-@ bri@@ dging , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent more co@@ res to us by Viktor Or@@ b@@ án , is an logical result of a seem@@ ing policy :
instead of working at the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , in order to help renov@@ ate structures , our ch@@ anc@@ ellor officially put into the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ ele of National Soci@@ alism .
the l@@ ending of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confron@@ ted in the bor@@ der@@ less areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Refu@@ ge@@ es must also determine that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a major challenge , facing the ongoing refugee flows and the coming winter , where decent resi@@ du@@ es for applying for in@@ seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be more serious - peace , security and stability in Austria .

the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; cra@@ ck@@ ous situation . &quot;
as a whole , Konrad talks on the demand of 85@@ ,000 boxes in the he@@ ur@@ ry year .
in order to meet the number , more than 35@@ ,000 properties must be found in the next weeks - 20.000 are supposed to provide 15,000 units .
should we get more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the Landes@@ haupt@@ werk he has dealt with talks .
these would have been granted to him , even for the coming refugees .
&quot; it goes well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is supporting Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , supposed to be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
big expectations of the asylum coordin@@ ator is also involved in the ORF action &quot; helping us . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer accommodation as well .
in addition , this is hop@@ ed for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of emergency it could not be that lod@@ gings must have a certain height of the hand @-@ holder or mag@@ n@@ itude of the ceilings .
for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would be considered .
unlike the Interior Ministry , he is on the occasion of the Home Ministry in Austria , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older Lord , whom you cannot tell without another in the face .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his main weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the republic without a cost as they themselves explained .
their employees want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
the own lod@@ gings were not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
the city of Linz is not planning a opening concert hall and other buildings , such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
it is not necessary to currently under@@ take the subject without these measures , says Mr. Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emergen@@ cies , however , further locations are to be tested on their bar@@ it@@ ability .
criticism of the city &apos;s bu@@ oy@@ ancy of refugees within the federal state .
other areas must also make their contribution .
See@@ hofer : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone call with the Bavarian prime @-@ president Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Minister Josef P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) has set the further procedure in the refugee question on Monday .
See@@ hofer gave me as@@ sures that the German borders are not sealed .
the res@@ ound of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany are still possible .
however , there are now just the corresponding border controls .
special lifts with refugees to Germany will not be there any more .
however , the search criteria would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once called on more reinforced solidarity in the refugee &apos;s issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now also Austria can control controls on its borders , for P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical episode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from passing the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; at the Lin@@ zer Industri@@ ez@@ rop@@ es is officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production buildings , the publicly traded IT group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is to be rented for young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material , and we must try to work it for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine , invest in start@@ up companies from the new ship@@ yard , and later also acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the beginning S &amp; T will cooperate with the new neighbours - a lot of business himself promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is covered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the total rated surface in the building are rented out , for another 40 percent give qu@@ en@@ quiries .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the centre of the new shop .
at fact , Jutta Bre@@ ast wanted to put a dog .
this project had to cur@@ b the 49 year old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad : finally , it has now gained further growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop in comparison to the business , in which they sold under other bags , bags , foot@@ wear and clothing of different manufacturers , everything is turning for ladies bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop is put into operation .
several weeks ago has been remo@@ del@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long over@@ laid hands on whether I should open up a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was that the Fur@@ la producer , which are at home in Bologna , were of the idea of a private location , where only their hand@@ bags are sold , were taken .
&quot; we are the only ones in the big room of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots .
Bre@@ it &apos;s fashion interest has taught in the cra@@ dle of her mother .
holding me most if something develops and I can show new trends at competitive prices .
why so , as to the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag featuring a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professionals do not answer last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is upgraded to any outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the pe@@ eled ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become a US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he manifest himself alien host@@ ile , journalists are concerned , or knowledge of knowledge in the international crisis policy - candidate for the US presidential elections ri@@ ver@@ ed sharp@@ ly .
and cuts quite well .
this is also registered in the Latin K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the estate revenues come from .
the New Yor@@ kers with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept for many in the wine stream along the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants site is related to him about -@@ six@@ ty corners with him .
his grandfather was born in K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about a ho@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his objective to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think the people find somehow fascinating , but are not so deeply impressed by their K@@ all@@ ot@@ ter way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous spro@@ uts , in addition to which the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz has been part of the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also regarding word - so with the testimony that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
while I give respect for the performance of the family , but they tend to say that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a little la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
acci@@ li@@ ger@@ ingly l@@ ur@@ king the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too German : the tut@@ ors , says she .
in the village of An@@ ders , Tr@@ ump happens .
the Tr@@ ump &apos; sche &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later man emigrated , and in the USA opened an eating house for gold dig@@ gers .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate group were first land @-@ purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : your wish to return to the home , failed by the Bavarian state to which the Pfalz was once included .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once taken without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Eth@@ nic History and Folklore , Roland Paul , explained to the film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ated statements of the desc@@ endant .
this repeatedly claimed over Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of an bound@@ ary wall to sc@@ ams illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the Polish , it is not as sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a Tr@@ ump Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner , retired , sees the Americans rather dist@@ illed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s always like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ er in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentioned such a K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which was generally well an@@ nex@@ ed .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine the Donald , &quot; the 68 year old says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they do it better if he does not hear@@ ken , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had stayed at the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been as he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than it , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els Film , has been inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 puzzles and also in the USA are awakening the interest .

Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son posts in Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but it has no major shi@@ fts with the reviews for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine has been broad@@ cast@@ ed by the German capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ around abol@@ ished Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s fall .
the Rival sunrise , with moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , moved to London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this dis@@ advantage of the insur@@ rection appeared to play no role for Australian TV spectators , as the sunrise on an average of 39@@ 7,000 spectators scored with the five major cities , compared with Today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase from the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) and his number stayed behind the previous Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former super@@ star of Pack@@ ed to the ra@@ fting Erik Thomson .
the new drama on a recently so@@ unded father , who decided to settle down with his two children in the New Zealand coast , has a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were asked if Thomson had managed a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ fting star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
this evening , the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of seven remained heavily with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and defeated slightly The block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 pm ) , the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , showed an average 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators .
half an hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jum@@ ped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia posted 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour of $ 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the needs of the second evening of The Chase Australia will confi@@ d@@ ently vote that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will eventually settle after 17 : 30 .

the last three vote : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki , may apparently arrive at least who wins the bach@@ elor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood , under@@ scored a Bachelor &apos;s degree , was in@@ dig@@ ging in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left @-@ left dam@@ sel will certainly not give up whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked to Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons &apos;s Fel@@ lows in the day before three two will be checked , you might be given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds up his lips until the final on Thursday sealed
all three women have fallen in ly@@ rical ways to read why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , amb@@ ition , family and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you who should receive W@@ oods &apos;s last rose , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers become a spoil , who won the hearts of the Bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Y@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly and easily - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house , and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed that they were pretty compatible , and I thought it was all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet on earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I knew this obviously not only a game - I am now un@@ restra@@ ined to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose who Wood to choose if not she was her .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the left @-@ loved girls alike - it is a draw made between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten , 19 : 30 on Wednesday .

J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest according to his move to USA - and there were many other teams that sent out inquiries to his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
a few train@@ ers would have banned Hay@@ es for the rest of the game when he lost a don@@ ke as it did as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League @-@ Kon@@ die during his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and Hay@@ on gave the next chance to a Pun@@ t return , and also to the current game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
instead of gr@@ ating ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula adds Hay@@ on publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne has also been encouraged by a special team co @-@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who advised him to catch his mistake and to take care of the next game .
J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne is Pun@@ ting at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnes@@ ota &apos;s Vik@@ ings .
it certainly was not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian sales team hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 because he could not perform a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that comes now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Origin debut then in 2007 , when a pass led to a land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a land of Queens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

but the record numbers of refugees now domin@@ ates the free elec@@ tors meeting .
&quot; of course , the theme for asylum from clau@@ se , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded the set up of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the former Yugoslavia war in the nin@@ eties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it doesn &apos;t work , we need to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to shift the Free voters as soon as possible .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW @-@ chief of the FW @-@ chief has not critic@@ ised that several federal states are not resol@@ utely sustainability : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is de@@ fle@@ cted , others not . &quot;
&quot; that is where we need to be more qualified . &quot;

&quot; the theme of the G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW boss .
we call for free speech to all the grammar school which we want .

4 people killed after police are shooting at prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after police over@@ threw the police in a crowd , demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , an officer said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , 175 miles west of Kathmandu City .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , executive District Apostle , said that over 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of you threw stones and fire@@ bomb . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police was put in Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and then shot in the air before they grip on rub@@ ber@@ y .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the gum@@ mos@@ h@@ ers , known from which they can kill they might have been used , however , traditionally produced as less fatal alternative , obviously causing such a high death rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict was the last in weeks violent protests in Nepal as the southern levels where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces are being formed under the proposed new constitution &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of De@@ arus , who want to become an own country .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , became in violent disputes since the 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed , when the four major political parties signed a treaty signed the country in the provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a controversial topic in Nepal who has been governed by centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legisl@@ ature intended to vote on certain issues in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the plot in the Old Post &apos;s Youth Centre should be re@@ constructed .

project H@@ ie@@ ve : details lying on the table
the planning for the holiday resort at the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented public plans for the project for the first time .
several an@@ tra@@ ilers are troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge .
for months , the ann@@ ul@@ led were ver@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
the plans for a new holiday resort are located near the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est@@ ent , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press Company , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the Municipal Development Committee of the Em@@ press Council on Monday evening .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , Ralf Behr@@ inger took off from the management team in the offensive : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t got a reply to all questions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said before the members , and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project &apos;s ten to twelve million euros has been discuss@@ ing this debate since months .
ris@@ ky reactions under sea bu@@ den@@ ers , who were come into session , cried out the images and new details to the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , hor@@ ror owner and member of the interests of the An@@ nex@@ er , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , Indi@@ cted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge ho@@ stage , who prot@@ ru@@ des all the other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics to carry out the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all bus loads to come to , so that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens actually on the good one @-@ acre area of the former inn , is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we need to suggest a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ end@@ lessly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lacking , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign which should help thousands of refugees to help thousands of refugees caught off the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of donations to his blog .
instead of doing a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled with her family from Kabul , was her personal experience with her family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our trip many dark railway and bus runs , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people are desper@@ ate for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations , which provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without boundaries , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first earned funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / w@@ ai@@ as to $ 11 million .
Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .
many fled Libya from the war , Yemen , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya .

for slightly overweight diabet@@ ics , weight loss can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert for weight loss surgery , which wrote a report on the new trial in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight Loss Sur@@ geri@@ es or O@@ bes@@ ity Surgery , apply different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b food .
because of the years , obes@@ ity has proven efficient to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies were performed using people , ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that somebody is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two kinds of obes@@ ity - gast@@ ric ypass and stomach tor@@ ches - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI among those who undergo surgery fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 till the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BMI with those who non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were roughly equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes increases completely and at 28 % partially .
in comparison with diabetes , the medical @-@ treated group dissolved itself only by one percent , and partially with only two percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally better in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surgical &quot; group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the authors noted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
Hem@@ ost@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level fell by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality rate in five years , so the leader Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
for the fifth year , the b@@ ypass Group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger set@@ backs in the BMI ( 7.4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ flow of the type ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit for surgery under five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden whose operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who undergo an obes@@ ity operation , approximately 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried using conventional methods .
although the new study does not have an advantage for survival in patients patients , Black@@ stone said , it was cal@@ ming for people with a BMI under 35 which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and its doctors should begin to take weight seriously if the patient lies with a BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long to take care of people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , they have connected their bodies to obes@@ ity and diabetes , recur@@ ring is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ s@@ rück !
it is a theme that is more este@@ emed present in Fiction , a young woman being un@@ popular and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , meets the warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
in addition , the novel is likely to be interesting to Hun@@ s@@ rü@@ cker readers , because he plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the surrounding area .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders called on to end the violence in the refugees of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which has devoted Eth@@ ics of Eth@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he requested that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be question@@ ed before the interests of individual nations or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also stressed that West European countries have ad@@ mitt@@ edly very much to the refugee crisis , but the situation isn &apos;t appropri@@ ately appropri@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama visited Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tack@@ ling the crisis , he emphas@@ ized that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of thousands of refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and real development , mainly through education that can be created for those Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bus@@ bot &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and presented that the violent reaction of the USA passed a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I have put my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the way to solve this problem lies in violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase from in@@ gest@@ ion for disinf@@ ection by children in the last 4 years
tox@@ icity centres in the USA reporting about almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , including strong alcoholic emergency services , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases reported from revenue of tools for children under 12 years , the tox@@ ic@@ ation centres report , from 3.@@ 266 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children seem to drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant while some do im@@ press her friends or for a rehear@@ sal in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teen@@ ager can drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people are supposed to mix disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft drink water in order to obtain a harder hot drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive d@@ ect@@ ants of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those , which are perf@@ umed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ berry , grapes and orange Bed@@ rooms , which are very appe@@ aling for children .
disinf@@ ection systems contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very small children can already lead a few spr@@ inkl@@ es to prevent alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Call Center at the University of Kansas , Kansas , Fox 4 , in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let go whis@@ key , but humans make this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant reach within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl with recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after stra@@ w@@ berry shower disinf@@ ection products in the school was brought into a emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered to be drunk in one adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , a emergency doctor that she treated at G@@ tiny Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors o@@ vised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had pushed the head , R@@ itch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use soft @-@ free products or disinf@@ ection systems outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were linked with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , for the swal@@ lowing of hands @-@ disinf@@ ection , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities assume that the meth@@ anol used the product , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class were planning to pois@@ oning its &quot; c@@ rates &quot; cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um using qu@@ anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , as regist@@ ering it as a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to the disinf@@ ection remedy and ban@@ ished them from their room .
the police regarded the au@@ tho@@ red plan as &quot; what moves &quot; and directed disciplinary action to the school .

it is because the Rang@@ ers isn &apos;t there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they are talking about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .

now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it is increasing in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people work for the United Kingdom as a whole , in the same period , by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.@@ 9 percent above the population of 5.5 per cent , as indicated by the Bureau of National Statistics ( ONS ) .

why I will be the witness to an execution in Oklahoma
anything later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it is not happening I will be sitting in a spect@@ ator in the Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the poison injection .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses on his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is chosen .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is selected , will watch the emotional release .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps eng@@ aging friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to take a not@@ ebook , and to take a pen to record out what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained about her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they agree that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told him that he can remove him from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter will be present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks the public@@ ity work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts , which I did .
I don &apos;t want to come up here again .
I can &apos;t tell you that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his acts , after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ k , would have guilty of being a companion in fact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that a strong probability , it is not guilty of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that there is no enough evidence to just@@ ify such death .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and I will die from this perspective .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can apply .
what you &apos;ll get of me is what it means to see a man a unnecessary death .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a attempt to impos@@ e a man from Perth , police was un@@ successful , as he removed himself in s@@ ne@@ aky and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few metres from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a domestic call incident in pel@@ vic .
when they discovered susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the stable ... Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not so excited to make it his uniform , so he turned a depend@@ able tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny stuff to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Master soccer player Ben cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , Cou@@ sins converted his car into the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim through the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspiring native to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben cou@@ sins be@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards tried to aus@@ ed him and threatened to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables in the last year and threatened to quit the race at once .
he was targeted at the ste@@ wards and the Integration Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on Wednesday because of a one @-@ day race for the last straw .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media that he is always trying to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself among difficult conditions as it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ t@@ up@@ finished rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is he could not explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back up 18 months because of sp@@ ying acc@@ us@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; predic@@ ting grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to say nothing about it and I have sat waiting for it , but sometimes you are fru@@ str@@ ated that everything coming out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they know they were far@@ ther .
sometimes you re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to go about it , and I want my owners to think that I try to do my best for her .
when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , Moo@@ dy got the bomb explo@@ it in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integration division had tried to rec@@ ise his stall .
&quot; in the eighte@@ en months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart was sitting in a room with a man that I will be asked - and they offered him a job in my st@@ ables to supply information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &apos; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if this is the case , they certainly should touch their n@@ oses , because they have attemp@@ ted to have failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , Former president of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , acting president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of its time and are still present today .
was it supposed to bring me to the view that it is personal ?
does RV@@ L have a cerem@@ on@@ ous behaviour and may be responsible for people outside the train@@ ers , what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think it &apos;s out there I am .
maybe you have to take my license and put me off , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it now .
but now I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the train@@ ee levels have been built with the long @-@ term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cob@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching explained that he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disc@@ ard his license on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ chi@@ pped master &apos;s Black C@@ avi@@ ar , noted the race @-@ treatment rule , &quot; after a package had been applied on the horse &apos;s deb@@ acle which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of race .
I need to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my people did not flat@@ ly put mud on the leg .
it could have been last night .
it could have been so all day yesterday , which was that way too .
but it had it on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three im@@ ph@@ onic dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who turn these rules , do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
man after driver acc@@ urs@@ ed

the cycl@@ ist was delivered with helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray @-@ Valley motorway .
the police said , the driver went on to stop without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday there was a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from Nathan the police in She@@ pp@@ art@@ on .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy to fight ri@@ vals for claims to fight
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has master@@ ed the cr@@ ot@@ ling of his players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favorites at the N@@ RL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson test@@ ified to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring@@ strug@@ gles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition with his team during the high Storm triumph in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane &apos;s bronze trainer Wayne Bennett did a barely cover note regarding the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; from Rug@@ by League and said that the two out of Queens@@ land were &quot; too good &quot; in struggle .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the tor@@ ch of his team and said they had focused on their &quot; contact &quot; at T@@ ack@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coach on his team is confi@@ d@@ ently , as it means that they were concerned about getting down from the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ strug@@ gling than she told us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed in all year nothing to our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but during the last six weeks we did our contact with T@@ ack@@ les made a real focus , and this is for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to get used to it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it &apos;s funny as this occurred again at this season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ quet St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 , St. George was more than a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we will watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you &apos;d like to play this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like them .
I build more confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also proved that the CM Storm Roo@@ ster game achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are auses doing and do not have anything wing@@ span ?
for me it &apos;s the schem@@ atics .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase yet .
the Storm team got free on this weekend , since they have the right to receive either North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday evening in the semi@@ final on the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning .
Serbia with 200,000 $ security deposit according to drug dress
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence , threat@@ ens to come in possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Queens@@ land for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life imprisonment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that it could have been a harmless reason in the café .
the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia . &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the complaint , he lied to the Police about its where@@ ab@@ outs .
as a security , Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as a security for his release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ dos@@ ing explanations of the two , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Justice Con@@ agan .
but this alone will not be enough to stop him from being appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ uses his Australian and his Serbian passport to call on a daily cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

a truck driver was severely injured during a dri@@ ve@@ way with three trucks on free@@ way 5 at Karlsruhe .
two of the three involved trucks had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent building site towards Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to so@@ ften the last moment as the police cleared .
the head @-@ house of the accident function completely set apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 @-@ highway between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked up to 2 : 00 hours .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure p@@ id@@ oph@@ ile for sending images .
a ped@@ op@@ hi@@ op@@ hi@@ z used the telephone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s telephone when this was sleeping , logged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of decent pictures of children , who were sent from another user .
the girl started up later and discovered the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it by , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed immediately their mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , analyzed a computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; web research , the terms used in search of un@@ decent pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g then directed towards the officials that he would have done it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; he then &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten her . &quot;
the At@@ tor@@ ney E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sheri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a diction that he is ad@@ dic@@ tive to fri@@ gh@@ ten people .
he gave the searches for the computer to be carried out by him , but he said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his convers@@ ations with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he will see images of ra@@ pe and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ or and the crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then looked at the un@@ even pictures on the phone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused Computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded not guilty to the meaning of the indictment , in@@ consp@@ icious pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have been released on January 25 this year and not to be appearing before a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defender lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual off@@ ences , since one might ar@@ gue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be found in his mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sheri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael will swal@@ low the judgment till October for the background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was allowed to be placed in this case but was held liable for hear@@ ings to other cases in pre @-@ trial detention .
he was still admitted to the date of the judgment in the directory of sexual off@@ ences .
tow fuel on small border passes to Germany
more refugees escap@@ es away from the major control points in the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks saved from fear of discovery and capture people in smaller ports .
on the Austrian side , one spokes@@ man on the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river streams of Passau and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn for more than 1000 refugees .
they were on foot about bridges and shr@@ ub to the German side .
there they will be taken over by Bundes@@ police in receipt and forwarded to registration .
at the Munich Central Railway Station , any more refugees met on Wednesday in comparison to the weekend of the Federal Police in Wednesday .
by 8.00 hrs , around 700 people have arrived at the Landes@@ hauptstadt , said a speaker in the morning .
following the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : the prec@@ urs@@ or of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest is expected
met@@ e@@ ologists war@@ n of storm in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to the deep pressure area above Western Europe , warm seafood are currently in the country , shared by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the strong cruci@@ f is the prec@@ urs@@ or of the tropical ho@@ ur@@ ring &quot; Henry , &quot; who has gone over the Atlantic in recent days of the Bermuda Islands .
intense storms and storm are expected mainly in bathing .
according to D@@ WD , until Thursday Thursday Thursday the Black Forest is in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Baltic Sea with bows of 60 to 90 hour kilometers .
by Friday the sun arises again much longer .
the mass makes it : every two years the high@@ ways at the IAA show its innovations .
in 2015 , particularly the movement of the compact cars is particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals were due to the national park ( KBA ) alone in August at this segment .
this is also reflected in the IAA ( public holidays from 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models and luxury cars are introduced between all the futur@@ istic design and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car is the Opel Astra , who will be available at dealers in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair .
he belongs to the core of the brand .
so that the volume model is also good sold , the new Astra should also not be much more expensive .
Opel presents a start @-@ up of the largest competition from VW Golf in the prosp@@ ect of 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs Euro 16 990 .
the Astra is with a new 1.4 kW / 100 hp output of 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , among which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the main competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is fir@@ stly to fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of com@@ bi which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will the Astra be on new comp@@ iles next to the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ compet@@ es Mé@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only one @-@ fifth in a conventional and under@@ stand@@ ingly sporty GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in trade he will come at the beginning of next year , then also as a wagon .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan spin @-@ off wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti logo adap@@ ts to the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will have a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : the original in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS .
the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton@@ meters of torque at 170 New@@ ton@@ meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but all @-@ round is the compact G@@ DS 4 compact machine model , which is shown at the IAA .
the designer of the design Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ ar@@ er put on the front part in front of the front part : the radiator shell was newly drawn and the projec@@ tors are equipped with LED technology .
in the interior space , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system is moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and the Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play is integrated .
added to the IAA in the compact class , a number of models and new variants , such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human worthy
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has just given an ex @-@ prisoner to the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary of Justice , which was lodged for months in a small cell .
due to the injury of human dignity , prisoners had generally claim financial compensation , if they are lodged in too small cells .
that decision adopted the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a ruling on Wednesday .
the suff@@ er@@ ers may even hope for the judges even if they were locked in tight spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his Constitu@@ tional Court was successful in Karlsruhe . he was accommod@@ ated in an individual cell in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separate .
after that , the man was returned to an open foot in the meantime , according to information from his manager , to a bigger cell .
his in@@ dem@@ nity due to the un@@ warran@@ ted prison conditions against the country of Berlin was failed .
but the Constitu@@ tional judges took up the verdict of the business@@ man in Berlin , and re@@ lied on the case to re @-@ check there .
they regard the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
shar@@ ehol@@ ding now decides on the amount of compensation
also , if for legal reasons , only a few days of detention had to be decisive for compensation , it was given a contra@@ diction .
otherwise &quot; an infr@@ in@@ gement of the justice must fear the personality . &quot;
the recipe must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the constitu@@ ent judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they said in April a prisoner of damage in April because he was locked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multi@@ occupation of a cell without a separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
Moreover , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court over@@ laid out a decent accommodation in a parallel incident on Wednesday in November 2009 .
the then Kl@@ äger has three months from 15 to 21 hours daily in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines in recent weeks , even because of lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ sion rises , even to s@@ laugh@@ tering it because of the cl@@ amped position .
according to the appointment of the Council of Justice , 21 spots in Te@@ gel was not occupied because of young people .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating that &quot;
immig@@ ration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are registered according to Germany &apos;s Federal Ministry of Justice in this year , following statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) surprised us with the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany will give the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Pest@@ el Institute ) dwell@@ ings annually , and this is the next five years .
this is nearly twice as much as it is built until now ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space , but above all at affordable rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing out of the rental budget , and around these very affordable housing will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister , Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is this from the perspective of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 students yearly had to develop and therefore the Bund should have to invest a subsi@@ dy of € 6,4 billion a year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists and Federal minist@@ ries agree that there are also more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of poultry users in Germany can be employed .
however , refugees in Germany were not even atically asked for their quali@@ fications to help them when Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
labour is the key to social contacts , but for este@@ em in the recording company , but also for the este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has given a political turning point : from the ban on refugees for the recognition of work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it used to be a banned asylum seek@@ ers for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces which seek@@ ers asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society itself - also because of the fac@@ t@@ act of experts - a majority of view that refugees should be allowed to have access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German language skills .
until now there is no sufficient offer to general and work @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that work@@ stations are also medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is , therefore , according to th@@ ri@@ ck@@ hardt , the king &apos;s royal road to dis@@ integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school management has found that only few families put up their children in the kit@@ ten , estimated at least ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the ro@@ oted parents it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ es@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , administration covers in different languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators climbed by the big number of refugees strongly , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity - by providing more technical schools .
in the countries , pupils are prepared without a German crafts@@ manship in the classroom .
they are not always trained by educated teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ eller from Berlin School Management .
the German student union estimates that about 20 percent of German refugees want to study in Germany .
basically , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , interior writer Frank Henkel ( CDU ) now has given its attitude .
studio approved for refugees could be facilit@@ ated to the university .
because the refugees with a permit or dul@@ ce does not receive services after the asylum seek@@ ers Act , when they begin studying .
the latter basically gets no B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they fall under the circle of authorized persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ged@@ ul@@ fed refugees to have lived in Germany for four years so far has been eligible to join B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this tax gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin , State Secretary for Science , and the German Association of Students .
the students should receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g right away .
Islam will now play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should have suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely mut@@ ated the same rights as they have churches , and the existing state churches should develop into a new state @-@ of @-@ state @-@ religions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also , the establishment of an Islamic welfare Federation which profession@@ ally takes care of the new arri@@ vals .
the rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts , and be ready to work together with the state in many areas and give him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the read@@ iness , cour@@ get@@ ing against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed fears , religious conflicts could be brought up to Germany in Thursday .
those who wanted to au@@ ge these conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be a lot more than today a theme by the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also change the majority society , de@@ pressing of discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination and general equality law .
but it is very slow , as the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal chances for all : what Mig@@ rant Organ@@ iz@@ organisations and stak@@ eholders are looking for long claim and for the international agreement , such as Anti@@ rac@@ is@@ mus@@ ism Germany , must become reality in the next few years , if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens must be able to benefit all its chances .
generally Germany is capable of supplying medical refugees so far , the medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we are creating that , &quot; he said to the mirror mirror .
however , we must flow additional money into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requires all deriv@@ atives in the registration of health cards .
these services could be reck@@ oned later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people assisted in the limited catalogue of services that see the asylum seek@@ ers Act .
otherwise the doctors do especially do the language barri@@ ers .
as far as yet , the Berlin Ministry of Health Science The@@ a Bor@@ de has been demonstrated to help immigrants from worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical centers would have been transferred to interpre@@ ting costs .
in the case , many refugees too would be put out in emergency ambul@@ ances with more general medical devices .
and with a different diagnostic glance .
among refugees , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities ; and among the young people go to HIV information .
but with some of the different clinical pictures German doctors tend to learn from their education , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite fall or tuber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the refugees , perhaps , deteri@@ oration in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a high @-@ developed educational system , but many refugees were even doctors .
in order to be practic@@ ed , however , they would have to prove their quali@@ fications as well as re@@ plac@@ ements .
at least half of the refugees in Germany follows the Federal Chamber of Methods ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ically ill : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially viol@@ ently be devoted to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study of TU Munich , however , proves that every fifth Syrian refugee refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
whoever dis@@ gu@@ ed in a post @-@ trau@@ matic Stress Dis@@ order is suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with hol@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , cordi@@ ons and death anxi@@ eties .
more symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to avoid that the symptoms were chronic , an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
yet , only four percent of the psych@@ ically sick refugees have received a gift .
although psych@@ ically dise@@ ased asylum seek@@ ers may take part in the social offices an application for Psychotherapy , but the processing usually lasts several months .
Moreover , in the social offices , non @-@ workers or doctors who are not trained for mental diseases , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
these often lead to mal@@ in@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .

for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst .
the gift to am@@ aze the family is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take away people from their at@@ day and to take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ resses the 27 @-@ year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; junior suite . &quot; &quot; &quot;

60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ izes Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
mis@@ prints in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to different animal protection organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst takes his position as well : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we do not feel good either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each strike has around 80 animals from five different continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read from the eyes after the possibility of each desire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel good , it will also not want to be in the ring .
so the first commandment is : good for the animals .
specially for their zeb@@ ra Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ st@@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst are proud .
the two animals have lived together in a enclosure for eight years , and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst talks .
the zeb@@ ra is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there &apos;s something to be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 a.m. and 8 p.m .
Sunday the programme starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .

Zimbabwe President Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case quickly spread throughout the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening has also been clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death thre@@ ats , and it warned not to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month they had exp@@ elled him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech that he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages on their cell phones , which they were warned not to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters for public speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they warned the members of Parliament that the imm@@ unity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man spokes@@ man said about Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard is able to reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is fore@@ seen by 25.000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts .
HP will later share in two publicly traded companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and service activities .
the expected job pitch leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in a declaration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable more competitive cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unity to separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than it &apos;s HP today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , to satisfy changing the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hewlett Packard enterprise has over $ 50 billion annual turnover and will be focusing on providing un@@ att@@ un@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such a declaration of the company .
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Hewlett Packard and has called Palo Alto &apos;s garage to the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ation to handle the departure from traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on belief that influences a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger said to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation has been progres@@ sing according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and his involvement in the next summer on the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that wild do had to end the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; he said .
it is a bone , which is not good .
there is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his Kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from pure medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized it gives the corresponding risk of other injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the examination of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 from Arsen@@ y &apos;s 157 League teams in the past five playing times .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight games since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League Clubs have been one of the most vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of success , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in injury during the last season will last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from a violation a period of time you have to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope to be stabili@@ zed his body , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deserves .
Arsenal , the Champions League Cup begins on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur at the coming Wednesday and Wen@@ ger introduces an rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also get Gib@@ bs Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott begin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and keep up the players , which you need to gain a little fr@@ inge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al was clear through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing places with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday , measuring 3.2 at the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal had drawn the teaching of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and stays with his management to lead the association to his first European policy triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; he said .
it has never worked before arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship : the com@@ edy show , which grants us serious lessons about defects .
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially regarding the need for men to open oneself , now even more dou@@ b@@ ted than ever before , such as self @-@ rates seen among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains more common in men than women .
at the efforts to tackle the problem , the Campaign against Living Mis@@ er@@ ical ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a pe@@ dest@@ al life ) in 2015 proved the goal of the man to ask the culture in question that men are looking for help , if they need it .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressed symptoms showed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , &quot; its chances of gene has doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of intellec@@ tu@@ ally healthy friends are the risks of mental problems .
but of course , you have to have friends to work for a friendship .
in the age of more social media guided communication , with their emphasis on style , the in@@ sever@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has the need to appear to be strong , li@@ vel@@ ier and successful , even though actually domin@@ ating the isolation .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists can call ex@@ tr@@ al values ; money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ tr@@ al values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deep .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire said recently , money can really not buy money .
the beauty of friends was that this focus has been put on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by its personality , who by the interaction as a friend .
hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler @-@ frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ents in the football courts in fine arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross as Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can always refer to , even if they are often restra@@ ined to explore their emotions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone number told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my audience &apos;s role for people who feel de@@ pressed and compl@@ ac@@ ent , has really shown me a difference even though the smallest inter@@ actions of friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has tremendous impact on how the feeling is perceived as a weakness which speaks about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term committ@@ al mechanisms .
it clearly shows the small moments of men &apos;s friends .
so very my objective out@@ sider status about the phone call people in moments of desp@@ air can also help those long @-@ term support is from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest@@ iv@@ ities with the celebration of the day completely new designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be at com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total number of 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Mary hits to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani based on his matches against Malm@@ ö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , Maria hits de Malm@@ ö with his debut in the Champions League .
here are the report and reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain commenced the Champions League Cup season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory in Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ adion .
in less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League dem@@ ur@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French master on the way , but after@@ ward they changed a number of occasions , before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani got a head@@ room in the 6@@ 1. minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A takes Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion , because it won &apos;t only aim the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter of the past three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics &apos;s pas@@ se chances in front of the gate . he later became in play against his home town team and against the club , with which he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League . that &apos;s why it &apos;s a good start to create our opponents and look back , even if there are certain things we have to take in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we have won , although I am sorry we did not have another or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic also returned to Paris @-@ team after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris @-@ team , which could be held on the weekend an 2 : 2 , but he was stopped by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ian wing fl@@ ur@@ ers became as the man named PS@@ G to take the next stage in Europe when he entered the next month of Manchester United when he entered into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind Malm@@ ö @-@ Defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and passing pretty in the long corner of the network .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic voyage at an Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , joined the field with nine national players on the field and was upgraded to a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle class at@@ oms a heavy enemy .
but except a d@@ ash from Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who are far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself appeared to sometimes on with some mis@@ under@@ scores and bad shut@@ ters , not least by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was put up in the first half alone , after Cav@@ ani had placed him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he pointed out much more skill , when he brought his fellow players to the game , and there was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria into a net shooting , which was buried in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . at Uruguay , he achieved his sixth season , after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic played a left f@@ lange of Max@@ well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö in play back to the game and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ low from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to stop the end result , before replacement player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi represented a gate at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League play was last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fier isn &apos;t enough . &quot;
hut from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented the switch from FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ avi will play for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar for summer 2015
obviously , the FC Bayern was just ahead of the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time of FC Barcelona .
eight time Spanish master , three times champion titles , four times champion League awards , two times champion titles , two times European champion , one time world champion , the title list of X@@ avi is breath taking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi met that he was already standing before the departure from Barcelona in front of the Euro 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything that we don &apos;t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the registered FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ on wanted me to have me . &quot;
for re@@ membran@@ ce : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ w@@ nee took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi hasn &apos;t changed
but the change did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ating man for this is today for the German record master : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has captured Gu@@ ardi@@ ola with contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that the crew could not imagine without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that he has w@@ alled me . &quot;
who knows how to run Bay@@ erns Season 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .

matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in movie create
matt Dam@@ on , the af@@ ro@@ American filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown confron@@ ted the diversity and said it will not be needed behind the scenes .
while a result of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light started the experienced actor Margaret when she stressed the need of alternative perspectives , in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the selected script of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown shocked me , with offensive un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ ti@@ an came to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production @-@ cent@@ ered Ben Mon@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to re@@ think people who think about it - who will be always the director - how they treat the figure of the harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , beaten by her white qu@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of dear White People tried for the fin@@ alists Leo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the direc@@ ting right to the film ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on said that their direc@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the discussion was released , the social media explo@@ ded on dis@@ approval by Dam@@ ons comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni put his anger over the clip , he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the only black person in the room , so he can explain the variety - this is SO WH@@ ITE is that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et served more than 5.000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 lique@@ urs since his release .
Dam@@ ons comments comes at a time in the exact @-@ cial representation in the media at the fore@@ front of social discussion .
after teenage girls , Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter generated national and displac@@ ed legisl@@ ature and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against color content .
in February , the singer Prince made a not@@ icing on the movement during the launch of the last albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quietly &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said .
as books and black live , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves &apos; movement published a declaration in response to the question of Fox News &apos;s Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group must be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was invited on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he received the invitation or met the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ning first champion
pro sport climbing and operator &apos; Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ let who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which completed just her 7th season , had never experienced a competition atten@@ de@@ es who could complete all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the seasonal trade , there were two men , cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the fin@@ als .
the climbing part belonged to the climbing at a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten ended up the task within the time , which he completed the first Ath@@ let , who finished the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard @-@ fighting victory , still under shock on the win of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or to life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ aps money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten ended first at all , not a prize money .
after the rules , money is the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he had de@@ pressed about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
the masses of awards were received by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac might have just felt , when they had@@ n &apos;t got the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an A@@ xis Season to start fil@@ ming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass over Minnes@@ ota &apos;s Twin@@ s
MIN@@ N@@ EA@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they used one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minnes@@ ota &apos;s Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the Twin@@ s applied a chance to climb the Ascension within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game card .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word which was so hard to gras@@ p over a big part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad S@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support as Detroit three times scored in the first two inn@@ ings sometime in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) turned 6 times into 1 / 3 inside and made 3 R@@ uns by fitting .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year greatly , &quot; Simon said .
it is hard to throw away any game in the bul@@ l@@ pen and therefore I want to go into the game completely .
the designated tiger @-@ Hitler &apos;s Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit Game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against Seattle nav@@ al on July 6th .
&quot; he worked well with the wood , &quot; she said .
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , saw clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh page , Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning of a double in the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ ding Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the sli@@ pper Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy was over , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was faced , prior to the designed Roo@@ kie Com@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who will run a Two @-@ Run stuff .
with a pair of runners and the final run @-@ run at the second round , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ k to a double play .
it was the time in major League premi@@ ère 27 time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ k hit a double play .
after Detroit starts to the bottom of the ne@@ on inside a Insurance Run , this wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , S@@ ano came out with three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from an even more moving Phil Hughes to the game .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed b@@ ans , who had been cancelled before the play of the injury list , after having found more than a month due to a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I had wished for , &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; but I felt better than I felt and felt that I would make some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after finishing off the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ype operated a single at Second B@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play the first run of the game by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third who ended the threat .
the tiger laid in the second , obtained one One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ é@@ tit@@ eur .
he has not worked well , but he caught the right job .
Hughes were located in a P@@ itch @-@ Count , and it did not receive any points in the third step before it was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ser .
at Hughes there was three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stroke outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez retired due to an injury to the throwing course .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who performed the San@@ chez shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ chez , from mid @-@ August on the risk of injury due to a shoulder risk , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez , from the game L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the injury list to start the Twin@@ s .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tiger since he was purchased with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been bl@@ az@@ ed for a break in the right hip on August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and the Twin@@ s will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minnes@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Off@@ ic@@ Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected at night on Wednesday .
the people involved in this call will then be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden , including the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it calcul@@ ates with 450 to 750 connected refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ esse state capital were prepared for this case in the last days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporary .
they should then be distributed to other municip@@ alities .
in the past ten days , according to details of the responsible government of G@@ ießen , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also established emergency shel@@ ters in London because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria as a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the un@@ important hind@@ ran@@ ce about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he cast up the European states &quot; collective &quot; sight . &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the chal@@ ice has gone to a military participation in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict must act right in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive boost of international assistance to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria once again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Minister of the Austrian Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV stations ORF , and now nobody was sent back to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , too , Germany had failed to transfer refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , this has been agreed , &quot; she explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement , after Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been involved with the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
concrete numbers did not name them and showed talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees from Hungary came to Austria in the past few days .
their destination is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun a temporary border control on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet committed themselves to a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers wanted to take a new attempt on the obligatory distribution of further 120 000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( September 22 ) .
faced with the strong refugee camp in Germany , the Bund wants to support countries during the initial intake and distribution of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Merkel under@@ line those people who want protection , che@@ w them , too .
but who doesn &apos;t have a lead perspective , could not be kept in Germany .
this view was dealt impressive in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed the state as a whole , now overcome a &quot; huge strength &quot; str@@ ingent . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
in the night of Tuesday , Hungary closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent sli@@ des@@ so@@ ons over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said about the proposed new border .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first adher@@ ents of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , other immigrants were reported to the Greek border for thousands of migrants .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean like Saturn En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
using the E@@ isp@@ anz@@ er of Saturn En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us is a global ocean .
these close researchers from observ@@ ations of the room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
therefore , the moon rel@@ ates easily on its path around the Ring@@ ier .
this bar@@ k movement is only small but too big for a continuous cel@@ est@@ ial body , it &apos;s said to be a notification from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers will present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist .
it was already known that there must be a liquid water under the iron ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was discovered in 2006 on the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ it the steam and the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there will be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers occurred then .
the extension of the hidden ocean was not resolved .
Rama missing 1860 München , several weeks
the 1860 of Munich has to do without a month in the open editor Val@@ det Rama .
an examination carried out a wound @-@ infr@@ in@@ gement for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association was divided .
Rama had been compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to the Munich lion , the diagnosis is expected to strike four weeks . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult for us to find that Rama is a very loss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport director Nec@@ at Ay@@ ben@@ n &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper with a look at the possible obligation of a unified organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sixth , however , presented the six@@ ties a def@@ ensive .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last in Belgium and was also under contract for the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ability to prove its skill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return back to the cre@@ ek training next week .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player should go into running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had bre@@ ached at Fortuna Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a fier@@ ce clas@@ hing .
contrary to the first fear , however , he remained without a serious ble@@ mish .
no diet fruit - man@@ gan@@ ese contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his sl@@ ender , often rather de@@ pl@@ aten .
because man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
these exotic fruits are still healthy : in them B @-@ vitamins and vitamins E and C. above all contain man@@ gos but plenty of vitamin A and the pre@@ amplifier beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
whoever e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports se@@ er , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or hard to smell .
the glos@@ sum alone does not say anything about what is ripe fruit - so also green man@@ gos are delicious .
they should be kept at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go there are also sav@@ our@@ able dishes for a special touch .
she reduces the slightly bitter taste of leaf@@ s such as Chic@@ o@@ ree and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ gan@@ ese babou@@ che fits well to fish , poultry , lamb , and wild .

first F@@ öh@@ n@@ ons@@ lau@@ ght , then a striking cold front
during the coming night in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ese people of the cave , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ wel@@ z broke in the middle on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night for Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n falls partly with storm tide by the F@@ öh@@ lau Group .
after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning you cross a striking cold front , which brings powerful ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature back .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland currently lies on the front of an extensive deep @-@ area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west flow .
on the alpine side it breaks through the valleys at night .
as a consequence , the F@@ öh@@ n leaves until Thursday till Thursday night in the di@@ ers with bows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can penet@@ rate until the adjacent waters , and even the mountains are possible from over 120 km / h .
as the northern part of the morning , dryer for sum@@ mer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the clo@@ ak will begin to st@@ ow away .
here ra@@ ins , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , South of the Alps has to be counted in the next 48 hours , partly more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , after during the last few days already great re@@ amounts are fallen .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ öh@@ n starts out the air in which a cold front covers a cold front with a strong , partly we@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind blo@@ ws sharp@@ ly to the stor@@ my , and the temperatures are clearly back .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther site
after the Reformation , barely 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther site .
in the presence of Santa Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a so far nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the names of the German reform@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of Rome beside the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the convention was requested by the community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remembered Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were able to live only a minority in secret of their faith .
in a symbolic way , I become visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he received the city as conc@@ e@@ ably sinners .
his negative feelings might be encouraged by the hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then led his thes@@ es on the separation of the abol@@ ish church by his thes@@ es .
hammer artist spent three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus , the gold ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) crown of thorns , is one of the main works that the Ot@@ t@@ Alt has painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated Bible lyrics .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ t @-@ Old Bible , which is now released with splendid pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ ta@@ alto , who has form@@ ulated his entire person@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories in 150 motives on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and f@@ anci@@ ful shapes the 75 @-@ year @-@ old was preserved - but in no way syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the relevant topics , this can indeed be quite a dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ t@@ Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has met a sub@@ jective and artistic selection from the many books of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cycles that dev@@ ote themes such as cross , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ather@@ ly .
in this way , he intri@@ gu@@ ed several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag , with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on fac@@ ebook .
and here is the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who composed himself up on the basis of painting with the relevant Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible interpre@@ ts selected by the Ot@@ t@@ Alt selected Bible and thus into the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cor@@ relations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Ancient painting .
they are nest@@ led among the original Bible study by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who form@@ ulates about his personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is equal twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who heard the strict Protestant rulers and community .
&quot; when the up@@ bringing already happened to the cane , &quot; Ot@@ t@@ Alt reminds itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to spend my father &apos;s father again , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ vit@@ alize the art in more fast time : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery today is characterized by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being edged out .
artists have another delight and delight to show things .
images have always something special and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Old would like to let the viewer put into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre@@ serve &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; dis@@ covering and feeling what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stopped on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ t @-@ alto Bible in the Ot@@ t @-@ alto Foundation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like to gras@@ p his own images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
old have not considered to gras@@ p the Bible completely , but most important for him , also mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text was explained merely &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
some of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ t @-@ Old Trust .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
plans made , place found , companies engaged to mod@@ ulate for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - still before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was already finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ is@@ om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration appe@@ aled to the residents , especially in the residents , which did not toler@@ ate railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;

DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga sets a clear indication for the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football respon@@ ds to the immediate situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics to help tack@@ ling the strug@@ gling problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can say in the principle that nothing comes to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be in every single interest to get this topic in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State Mrs Ö@@ o@@ ğ@@ uz and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the subject is certainly playing a central role , &quot; he announced .
football can and wanted to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must be politics .
for this reason , the German football League has expanded its refugees &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have assured the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung that this programme continues to run until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal cases also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 pro@@ filing had a clear indication , if they will help on the left tri@@ k@@ ot@@ le instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make sure that everyone can help where and how they can only do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ ver@@ kus@@ ens sports leader Rud@@ i Ful@@ ler told the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every day , no one can see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use soccer rules , no , we have to use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities for helping the many refugees who have already so incredibly suffered to help , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms Director Peter Ret@@ ri@@ man spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;

Nier@@ s@@ bach created the support of refugees as &quot; a big community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licens@@ ing projects have started their own projects in their locations , be great .
the same great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent will live in football .
&quot; it is of huge importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year the association will join the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government at 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the societies have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP Management Board loses eye on an eye
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has led the left eye for several reports according to a crash in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the stair@@ case of his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a glass of water after midnight , which he took in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s almost blood , was s@@ wo@@ oned , and then went out into the streets - that he told us so much last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could not do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we met before the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is with this meeting and is fully operational . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to introduce the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its leader Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually takes on between Germany and the U.S. , but in summer he was no longer in the German headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to public with such a personal history , the Manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again when you are fallen . &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback in Marco Re@@ us had finally beaten at the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player is also missing the table leader of the soccer league in du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 o &apos;clock / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ ver@@ kus@@ en , the Bv@@ B coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in the face of the high load of its pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its eleven position at the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ ying position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place of a b@@ art@@ ender novel Bu@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer teacher added the world champion .
whether female prop@@ eller is used in future in all Europa League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
at high probability , he will contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the resear@@ ching statement of Mit@@ t Re@@ us that the Fin@@ al@@ rede@@ em@@ ary for the Bv@@ B in the Europe League will be the end to be trace@@ able : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot;
rob@@ otic cars : government wants to lead role for Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany should be on the transformation of the car technical fron@@ trun@@ ner .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investments in expanding digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the Edge of the Autom@@ at Show at a &quot; New Mobile Age . &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase the traffic safety and take care of less st@@ out , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G7 states that come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper of the transport ministry has under@@ lined the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and an excellent entry on digital radio channels .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being used for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks to be br@@ ushed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will check the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany is about to use internationally that the maximum allow@@ able speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
Moreover , the Federal Government will also apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fore@@ sees people as a driver .
automated driving takes over the car &apos;s lead , the driver , the driver will become more and more for passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 is technically possible .
however , sett@@ ling vehicles on public roads were expected to expect only far to 2020 . &quot;
the value creation in the driver &apos;s driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport critic S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the drivers must clearly be clari@@ fied .
however the Germans are still scep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ chman or Americans .
one on the AA pre@@ determined survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator DE@@ K@@ RA is coming to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that self @-@ autonomous cars will continue to pass through the next ten years , 32 per cent count generally not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents reck@@ on by 2025 with autonomous cars , in the US 33 per cent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave for a self @-@ moving vehicle .
following a survey in the Bit@@ kom conference , only seven percent would agree to vote during the entire drive on all roads .
on the free@@ way , still at least 15 percent of current traffic can be seen , in St@@ au 45 per cent .
well each V@@ ed would leave behind the car under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ eps Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the course of EM @-@ Lehr@@ buch in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this point on the flight to a long @-@ term Spon@@ sor@@ ship in China .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax @-@ intri@@ c@@ ate kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which are terri@@ fying due to video projec@@ tions .
they carry the spectacular creation of the French designer , amongst others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and there@@ with he put bands into skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant in the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ aching , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed at a show over his person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was actually , in contrast , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition being a bit for death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if one dies , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection was originally made in Canada , Canada , and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits include an insight into the man &apos;s looking piece , which has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship there .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ er , for which much expenditure was powered : for example , a styl@@ ist was engaged . for example , a styl@@ ist was engaged .

Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artist &apos;s old Teddy is on display at the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ eless fashi@@ onable sal@@ aries of the designer .
as a kid ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) he attracted his Teddy B@@ HS and dresses , Gaul@@ tier .
playing a doll , his parents would not have allowed him to play .
he subsequently worked to design fashion later .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw other designers from other designers , as Gaul@@ tier was told in Munich .
later I bought it then .
for his first fashion show , he could not pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ out tip as a fashion niche
previously we went to the long embro@@ idery motif in and around pl@@ ush down to make yards .
the best materials and tips worked in large quantity for customers who , for instance , worked on the ceilings and curtains .
today it doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , manager of the E@@ quest@@ rian j@@ ow@@ es .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early times of Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s point , fashion has played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as n@@ ical re@@ discovered .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is inc@@ ited in sty@@ list@@ ic periods , is an increasing client potential .
who supplies no niche in the textiles industry in Germany is not on the market anymore .
with us , they have already made half of all orders .
E@@ quest@@ rian Pl@@ auen , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association of Pl@@ au@@ es lace and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales have been taken away .
private shops and the wholesale store are almost no longer available .
our products hardly recognise the customer in this way .
nowadays , the mass products are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively on chains .
also flag@@ ging of export , current to Russia and to the USA .
so many reasons for new paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also attempts to score as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cord@@ ula Bauer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Emb@@ ro@@ le , explains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we will produce a seal of quality , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally balanced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diplom@@ at U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger outdoor station of the western Sax@@ onian University of Z@@ wick@@ au - speci@@ alizing in the fac@@ ulty of applied arts and is specialized on embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
to oppos@@ e the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a tension area between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which have to think particularly economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design often will vary only slightly to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter introduced the historical p@@ ail lace .
the machine fu@@ ds small ch@@ icks in some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schm@@ ie@@ mic Championship in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ se had inspired this : &quot; I could not do anything with traditional Pl@@ aces &quot; before . &quot;
now they are used for their jewelry for their jewelry .
in a elabor@@ ate process , it defines the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the theme of the spot - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies the USA , Australia , and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors were living in pl@@ ush and environment , and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
with that I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of Pl@@ au@@ ener .

XI is pushing to open the economy wider than the world
the economy must move wide to the outside in order to fo@@ ster growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , on Tuesday , was asked to carry out the reform of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be deplo@@ ying foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for start @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in an speech at the 16th session of the central leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote and encourage new spin @-@ ups and reforms the new vibration and vit@@ ality will bring about new place for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the group leaders have adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for the provision of the market access , to fill out the border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul the population mel@@ des@@ ystems .
after statement , a negative list will be created by sectors and companies which do not come into question for investment .
the system is tested and tested by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it has a major role in the allocation of resources , a legally binding business environment that ensures open the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government also checks controls on the businesses transferred to the companies and make sure that companies will decide how to take their transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China divi@@ ding borders will allow new models of cross border economic operations and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of a bid@@ der , state @-@ controlled sectors are open , other areas are open for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ght@@ ful interests of foreign investors and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for fore@@ ig@@ ner to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by facilit@@ ates the requirements and application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to deplo@@ y professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed during a session .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and an important leader , like Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , were also reported as stated according to the declaration .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ point value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and therefore provide a significantly higher dose of nerve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer &apos;s organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding job paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects in inf@@ alli@@ ed industrial and environmental policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is to estimate the limits of nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are so strongly affected by mercury in today that the limit values are not sold at the current limit value of about 50 per cent of the length .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available .
in return for this interview , the EU is hoping to reduce the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , recorded this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller tri@@ f@@ fish , such as car@@ p mostly loaded as low , they will have the proposed maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , therefore , is a per@@ fi@@ ddle of de@@ fle@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy heavy metal that accum@@ ulates in the food chain above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small quantities are particularly affected by the native damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry announced on his website with regard to the valid values , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ human compan@@ ions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is especially able to reduce its combustion into the environment .
according to a written report by the Federal Ministry of Science , the German Ministry of coal rebu@@ ked more than six metric tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the collected volume em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube can be &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been cited in the paper in March .
last year , the European war@@ nings of mercury in fish already reported to the most common health risks in the EU &apos;s warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
