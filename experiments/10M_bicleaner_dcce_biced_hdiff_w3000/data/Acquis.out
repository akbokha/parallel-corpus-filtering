purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedure defined on securing measures defined in part of the part I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the backup procedures established in this Convention is a tim@@ ely discovery of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent by the risk of premature discovery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for sub@@ missions of the target set in Article 28 , material accounting as a backup of fundamental importance , combined with spatial intervention and observation as important additional measures , is used .
the technical conclusion of the exam@@ inations by the organization takes place by a statement , in which the material quantity does not differ for a period not given due to the accuracy of accuracy for the specified assembly .
the organisation uses the organisation according to article 3 of personal use by the guarantee system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material zones .
when applying the backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind , and they are as far as required , as they are in the comple@@ mentary estimate .
( a ) a system to set the quantities of hal@@ f@@ ading , printed , lost , lost or any other way from the hol@@ dings of distant core material and inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and evaluation of measurement in@@ security ;

the organisation is based on the initial report of the initial review of the whole , securing measures of this Convention on Nuclear F@@ oods in the States , regardless of its origin , pointing out and conduct this stock directory because of the following reports and the results of their tests .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation )
in ER@@ WA@@ EM@@ ENT , following reasons - a ) The EEC decided to address the special action programme set on the conference for international economic cooperation with low income , whose development is blocked with low income , whose development is blocked by general res@@ our@@ age problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and Member States that the entire of the Member States will be bound within six months following into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force of loans , and the organization will enable you to solve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the Organization have cons@@ ulted on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the connections to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organization has presented a table to the EEC , in which way it is intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organization establ@@ ishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special offer account &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is managed by the States in accordance with this agreement to the special action account ; this account is considered to be considered as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this agreement and according to the purpose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be paid in the form of cash or non @-@ ins@@ ulted bonds of the member state , upon request in the currency of the organization as a administ@@ er of the special re@@ ac@@ tionary account and to be paid by the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . payment within 30 days after entry into the agreement or another between the EEC and the Administrator @-@ agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the reserve to 1 January 1979 or at a different time , which was agreed between the EEC and the Administrator for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every member state can afford the payments of the above mentioned dates .
the manager takes part in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization about propor@@ tion@@ ate pulling on cash or debt , in order to cover the expenses for the special loan loan and custom@@ ization in a reasonable manner .
under the warranty of these loans , the fo@@ rested according to the terms of the EEC are guided by the following factors :
III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors contributed to the present and desired economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and tendency towards the debt of debt in the country and its further credit card capacity for loan loss ; and
VII . the scope of which the problems of the countries concerned may be governed by contributions from other sources .
each special loan loan is based on financing of a clear ris@@ ky and rapidly re@@ payable development program ( including a sec@@ toral program ) , which shall be governed , approved and managed by the organisation of the organization financed by the organization of the organization , which is under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ bel to this agreement to consider the aim of the Additional Ad@@ mission .
the funds of the special re@@ ac@@ tionary account must not be used rather than the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or organization , which has been approved in the context of a loan or loan loss , which has been approved by directors of the Bank or organization .
apart from section 4 , special loan loan agreements are subject to the same re@@ payment terms which apply for the organization granted by the organization ; they are payable in ten years , in 50 years .
credit cards are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are payable in these currencies .
amounts to the payment of this blo@@ c can be directly linked to the organization that maintains her .
each special loan loan is separated by a separate loan agreement between the receiver and the Administrator , where the origin of the means is stated .
the proceeds from each special procedure can be used for expenses in the currency of the receiver or for goods or services ( ii ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries ; the members of the organization are and according to what the managers have been set at the time of loan granted , recipi@@ ents of a special procedure would be .
cash payments from special offer loan will be made to the special offer account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a Mem@@ orandum as soon as possible from the administrator to the corresponding member state .
the Administrator has taught the EEC as far as complete payment for all special actions in preparation by directors in preparation and by directors approved by directors and programmes .
during the time of withdrawal of the special loan loan , the Administrator has quar@@ terly on the development of the special loan loan and the expenses for this .
the ste@@ ward transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the special re@@ organisation with an opinion of the external audit@@ or of the organization to this account .
after full @-@ payment of the Sonder@@ acute loan the Administrator &apos;s manager transm@@ its as soon as possible a detailed report on the project financed by the special re@@ ac@@ tionary account .
the Administrator is created and causes suitable recordings and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special ac@@ tionary account that are collected from the account of the account and exp@@ iring from the account and deposits to the Member States .
the EEC and the Administrator are closely involved in achieving the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the Administrator for the complete edition of the Sonder@@ tionary Account from time to time to have a change of ideas financed by special respon@@ ding programmes or projects and any other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the EEC and the organization may agree not into force , the agreement and all obligations of the parties are due immediately due to immediate effect .

between the European Atom@@ ic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the Territ@@ ory of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma samples
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ P@@ EAN Atom@@ ic Energy Association , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ at@@ om &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , listed below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program covers the creation of a large experimental plant , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company after chapter V of the Eur@@ at@@ om Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Common Companies J@@ ET . &quot;
for several years , Switzerland has been involved in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma samples and is well entru@@ sted with the area concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still to be carried out , it lies in the interest of the contrac@@ ting parties in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ rides and to acceler@@ ate their respective research crisis , which have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this agreement is to prevent any contrac@@ ting party in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma samples provided for the mutual research work , i.e. the common aim of this research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ competitive power generation by using controlled nuclear power action , faster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve the goal of the present agreement , the parties involved their respective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ at@@ om Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss Program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot;

agreement in the form of a letter between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the Member States in the context of medium @-@ term financial assistance
the B@@ IS could include Stand@@ by credit deal with the central banks of the credit@@ ors if the banks issue an appropriate request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement could be closed to the total amount paid by the credit@@ or for the total amount paid by the credit@@ or , namely to a total limits of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 bn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; representing 50 % of all future will@@ ing@@ ness of the member countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now there are some conditions listed below , whose application would be ready for the BI@@ Z .
with each Stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially take over a commitment for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without that a total of five years is exceeded .
with the opening of the credits as well as for their approximate extension , the BI@@ Z would calculate a credit facility vision .
in addition , it would agree that the first pulling power cannot be made before exp@@ ul@@ sion of a month after exp@@ ul@@ sion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liqui@@ dity .
the thre@@ ats would occur in the US dollars at conclusion of the agreement made available , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to time periods to take into account the funds , expected three or six months .
the conditions would match those , which the BI@@ Z are w@@ asted at the time on similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would comply with the market rates largely .
