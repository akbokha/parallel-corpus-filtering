this document is a summary of the European public announcement report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the committee is evaluated for Human@@ ity &apos;s Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) to get recommendations on the application of the drug .
if you require further information about your disease or treatment , please read the packaging age ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melted tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to inhal@@ ing ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. vert@@ eb@@ ral thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or sight of things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ ane ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of an abnormal mood ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal spirits .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe hormone episodes and to prevent Man@@ ical episodes in patients who have been addressed to the medicine in the past .
injection solution is applied for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied to single or melt z@@ eng@@ es in patients where the swal@@ lowing of tablets is processed into difficulties .
in patients who simultaneously use other medicines the same as Ab@@ ili@@ fy should be adjusted , the dose should be adjusted by Ab@@ ili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs signal transmission between &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among themselves .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole carries on norm@@ alize the activity of brain , causing mental or man@@ ic symptoms to be prevented .
the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy , to prevent resur@@ gence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar ill@@ nesses that were involved in increased distur@@ b@@ ance , over a period of two hours compared to a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , Ab@@ ili@@ fy was evaluated over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to re@@ occur on 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had been stabili@@ zed with Ab@@ ili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which suffered an increased dis@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the changes in patients suffering from a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who used to treatment were examined .
the company has also conducted studies to investig@@ ate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and absor@@ bs the solution .
in both studies of injection solution included patients who received ab@@ ili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger decrease of symptoms increased dis@@ rup@@ tive than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Ab@@ ili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term clinical symptoms effective as plac@@ ebo .
in addition to 74 weeks , Ab@@ ili@@ fy prevented last@@ ingly more effective as plac@@ ebo the re@@ occur man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
ab@@ ili@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses are also effectively more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased dis@@ rup@@ tive and were similar to lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Ab@@ ili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) , acu@@ ity , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , drow@@ sy ( dis@@ ation ) , drow@@ sy , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , breath @-@ hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , o@@ rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ ity P@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of ab@@ ili@@ pp@@ ies in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who were mostly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were silent against the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable to conc@@ eive the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission announced the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of heavy @-@ heavy episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients that mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected , although single patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors are just@@ i@@ dered ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ A4 induc@@ tor is set off in combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavi@@ ours is one of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , including Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic study showed that there was no risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder than Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ nit@@ in@@ far@@ ction , cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease , conditions that apply for hyp@@ ot@@ onia or hyper@@ tension , treatment with ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ema ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ s : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis should occur , the dose should reduce or break the dose .
if a patient developed signs and symptoms resulting in a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ires in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with conditions that are used with caution .
56 - 99 years old in patients with psych@@ osis that were associated with psych@@ osis suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a increased death of death in comparison to the plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relation between the dosage and response of unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases , extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients that were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia related events at AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated with direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regards to a deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as a side effect is known and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole can be used in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alized drugs as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric @-@ acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ il@@ reductions .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &quot; bad &apos; ( = Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ es can result in high @-@ effective In@@ hibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations in higher plasma samples compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
if one draws the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should weigh the potential risks for patients .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eases , should have similar effects and therefore a similar dose of Dos@@ age should be made .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dose level before the front of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered jointly with an even increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the met@@ abolic of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 method@@ ology of morph@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ et@@ zol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
people should be advised to inform their doctor if you are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to in@@ adequate data to safety during the human being and due to the reproduction of the animal , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the possible use just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned , hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , to use , until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on it has no negative influence .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) referred to as under Plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was treated in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
Man@@ ical episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study above 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study above 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term phase , over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo among which significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters were found , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ oma in comparison to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and above their occurr@@ ence in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , adverse dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry and var@@ ic@@ fan@@ cies , adverse cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in elderly dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate acute excess of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death row .
although there are no information about the efficacy of a tick in the treatment of an over@@ dose associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis is an over@@ dose of use because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma cutting .
it is thought to describe the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a particip@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ or and the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ or as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ches and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .

in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a half @-@ stage @-@ controlled study , 52 of the percentage of respon@@ ding patients who contributed to study medication remained similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured data , which were defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement as at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia a significantly higher reduction in re@@ membran@@ es , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ oma Group , and 57 % in plac@@ ebo was found .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , mult@@ in@@ ational double @-@ blind study conducted in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients received a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . 5 % ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy of plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks versus plac@@ ebo .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with either a lack of psych@@ otic mercury , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a corresponding effectiveness in week 3 and a vig@@ orous effect , comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable part of patients suffering from symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania to such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with either a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar disease , with or without mental health , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was diagnosed with superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .

the average elim@@ ination time of approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ be@@ z@@ ole is about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = Po@@ or &apos; ) met@@ abolic antenn@@ as using CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ raz@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics between male and female subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients no sexually dependent effects .
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics has no clu@@ e on clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ro@@ eth@@ ics or the effect of smoking in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ be@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young volunteers .
a single dose study at subjects with varied liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to attract mud to their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies for security resin , tox@@ icity in repeated , reproduction , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and can@@ o@@ gens , the pre@@ clinical data could not recognize particular dangers for humans .

Man@@ ical episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study above 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought to describe the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a particip@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , mult@@ in@@ ational double @-@ blind study conducted in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients received a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . 5 % ) .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage of bi@@ polar or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared with healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max level of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) lay .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate mon@@ ast@@ ocy@@ tes in the bile stra@@ ins of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages of 3- and 11@@ x of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for rapid control of ag@@ it@@ ud@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be completed and the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should begin .
to minim@@ ize the resp@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in re@@ membran@@ ce of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicine used already for the maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in case a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the features of the drug at AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melt z@@ eng@@ es or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to use .
there are no investigations to the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ it@@ ud@@ ity and behavi@@ oral disorders , which were different from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in addition , a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is necessary in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution as necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme liver or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations to safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not present for patients with alco@@ hol@@ ism or drug pois@@ oning ( by dis@@ ma@@ ize or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ nit@@ in@@ far@@ ction , cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease , conditions that apply for hyp@@ ot@@ onia or hyper@@ tension , treatment with ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ema ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness or symptoms of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse , blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ bar@@ a , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regards to a deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels .
a weight gain is generally used for sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as a side effect is known and could lead to severe complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ an was compared compared to the sole gift from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers were applied as one @-@ time entry into tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly and the simultaneously Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were received in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric @-@ acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar dos@@ il@@ reductions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dose level before the front of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received , was the intensity of the Sed@@ ation Big@@ ger compared to the sole gift from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were common in clinical trials including Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under Plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under Plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral eth@@ yl@@ benzene as a possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was treated in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study above 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during long @-@ term phase , over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo among which significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters were found , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of C@@ p@@ k ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ oma in comparison to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .

110 and behavi@@ oral disorders was associated with statist@@ ically significant improvements of ag@@ itation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ it@@ ud@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , was associated with a statist@@ ically significant improvement in regard to the ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ plac@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement in the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5,8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,6 for lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ itation , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance was observed due to reduced patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half @-@ stage @-@ controlled study , 52 of the percentage of respon@@ ding patients who contributed to study medication remained similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) in both groups .
current values from measured data , which were defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ sion Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement as at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the dec@@ ay rate , which was 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , mult@@ in@@ ational double @-@ blind study involving sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients were included and in which the primary study destination &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less than 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . 5 % ) .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with either a lack of psych@@ otic or psych@@ otic mon@@ otherapy , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not reveal a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study conducted by a 74 weeks study followed by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before Rand@@ om@@ ization a re@@ mission was found in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , predominantly in prevention of return to the mania .
in the first 2 hours following in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C is greater than the AU@@ C after the gift of the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposition was similar between the two form@@ ulas .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level is 1 @-@ 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target for system@@ ic exposition ( AU@@ C ) , which were in 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposition of 30@@ mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies about intra@@ ven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns according to matern@@ al exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposition of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) to safety , re@@ produ@@ ox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and can@@ o@@ gens , the pre@@ clinical data had no particular dangers for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects rec@@ alled a dos@@ si@@ ent @-@ dependent adverse drug accum@@ ulation ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 @-@ fold in@@ car@@ cin@@ oma @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ os was diagnosed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate mon@@ ju@@ x@@ yl@@ benzene in the G@@ alle of monkeys for repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 @-@ 3 times the recommended maximum dose of people based on humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane has been studied in a main study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters of which an Anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line had been received .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the effects ) .
overall , the study spoke 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients for the treatment to the treatment of 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
consider only the patients that were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between pharmac@@ euticals for the first time until deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients showed the previously other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , with regards to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane has been more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients , feeding or before beginning of treatment low Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ium in the blood .
the committee on Human@@ itarian regim@@ ents ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane has resulted in patients that the first treatment was not given more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that it must not be given in other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission announced The Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited granted a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients by which the first line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and not shown for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy during Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
for sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy degrees 3 the treatment is under@@ gone until an improvement is reached on degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of Dos@@ age adjustments in patients with mild to moderate interference in liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies involving patients with det@@ ecting kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to in@@ sufficient data for imm@@ unity and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an album @-@ contained Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ bon form@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be taken away and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles are to be initiated , until the ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ count increased again on &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ds has increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven in relation to cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea , these can be treated with common anti@@ em@@ et@@ ika and con@@ gru@@ ous means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied with pregnant or pregnant women , which are no effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in ro@@ omy age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is enriched , while and up to six months after treatment no child are test@@ ified .
male patients should be advised of treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause adverse events such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the traffic and the ability to serve machines .
the most common and most important inci@@ dents are listed below , which performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated at the piv@@ ot@@ al phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
the side effects listed in Table 1 are listed in the adverse events that occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ces and the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules stabili@@ zed by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation performs a blocking of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ ed the tran@@ si@@ osis of plasma components into endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies were proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ ale transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ or , and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs in the field of tum@@ ors .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two unanim@@ ous un@@ affected studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , performed in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 hours in@@ fusion for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study included 64 % of patients had an imp@@ rec@@ ess overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ates .
14 % of patients had not given chemotherapy before , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy ; 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progres@@ sion of disease as well as progres@@ sion @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus Pac@@ ar@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients that at a time during therapy a periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy grade 3 was evaluated .
the natural course of periph@@ eral ne@@ europ@@ athy to bal@@ eline regarding the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 therapy courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el according to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
exposure to exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane an patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma cent@@ ric took off in a multi @-@ phase .
the average distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a wide ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or female binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was after Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
published in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue stories , that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed to 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and into two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 ) -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .

there are only a few data available for patients at the age of 75 , since only 3 patients were participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in front of light exposure above 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ cancer drug and , as also with other potential toxic substances , should be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
using a ster@@ ile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute , 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chloride in@@ fusion solution are inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane penetration bottle .
after the complete enc@@ ore of the solution the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good b@@ out of the solid substance .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and it has the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which the surgery could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion . if the surgery is not possible , and with which a loss of blood from 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a doctor , who has experience in the treatment of patients with ill@@ nesses , for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own bleeding problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or the maint@@ ainer person , if they have received an appropriate manual .
in patients with chronic kidney disease , or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults , between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ) .
the iron values of all patients suffer from treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is made , and ice @-@ energy should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , a an@@ emia can cause a er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ etic deficiency , or that the body does not adequ@@ ately address the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ etin .
er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ etin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing blood vessels .
it is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) to be authorized for the formation of epoxy al@@ fa drugs .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection in a v@@ eins in a v@@ eins in a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by the reference medicine .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks before they were either depos@@ ited to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks .
main inde@@ x@@ ator for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ic values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also submitted the results of a study where the effects of inj@@ ected off the skin did not jump with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ ox@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study of patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ic patients were prevented on Ab@@ se@@ amed , in the same degree as with those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients showed continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ ox@@ o , a rise of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of an output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , stag@@ gering mig@@ raine and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients which may potentially be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against epoxy al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are necessary to make sure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee on Human@@ ity &apos;s Internal Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the medicine has provided a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , in accordance with the regulations of the European Union .
the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information for medical professionals in all Member States , including information about the safety of drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Drug P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG - approval for placing Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .

symptoms and symptoms can be different depending on age , gender and overall diseases ; therefore , assessment of individual clinical trials and clinical condition is required by the doctor .
an increase in the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin to more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ al values can occasionally be observed in one patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
given these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries an appropriate dose management should be attemp@@ ted to achieve hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin targets of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ al value is increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ je exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be controlled to ensure that ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest permitted dose which is necessary to control an@@ emia and intake symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initial low he@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl ) or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l , possibly higher yield doses require less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl ) or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit when the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation concentration is mainly due to the control of the symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in patients with chronic kidney disease , clinical @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency and clinical in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded in the 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin targets .
according to this findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with er@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not to be di@@ aly@@ sis , not acceler@@ ate the progres@@ sion of the kidney failure .

if the H@@ b @-@ rise is exceeded 1 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ al an@@ emia - dose @-@ induc@@ ed treatment with the goal to keep the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ al between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction , which should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger @-@ orthop@@ e@@ dic procedure , if possible , before beginning of the ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated appropri@@ ately .
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic surgery , such a reasonable risk for thro@@ mb@@ al and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly in case of underlying cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease , should have an adequate risk of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease .
in addition , it can not be excluded that in treatment with er@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with a starting bonus of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ al / vas@@ cular events can be established .
in several controlled trials , for periods of tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia , they are improving the overall survival or reduce the risk of tumor progres@@ sion .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) in both women after men@@ opause and men .
it is applied in patients with a high fre@@ ading risk ( bone breaks ) , including those who have suffered a small trau@@ matic hip hop as at the H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get &apos;s bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should intake at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with ke@@ en fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflamm@@ ation ) in the three days after the use of inflamm@@ ation , such as fever , muscle pain@@ s , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material was drawn to z@@ om@@ eta for the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis have been involved , and the number of vert@@ eb@@ ral and ke@@ epers have been studied for a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years , who had suffered a fra@@ cture recently ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in the Pa@@ get Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies of a total of 357 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme , which is degra@@ alized in the blood ) in the blood , decreased to at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ inal frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % for patients with patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis regions ) .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis , the risk of cer@@ eal frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip fra@@ cture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients which may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions on in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( die of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides clari@@ fication material for physi@@ cians who contains as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who are explained to the side effects of the drug and is pointed out when they should consult the doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; April 2005 the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ art@@ is Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the patient information package should be provided and the following key messages include : • The Pack@@ ing be@@ il@@ age • contra@@ ction of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • The important signs and symptoms of serious side effects • When to use medical care or care
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ ma fra@@ cture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men a intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
for patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after surgical care . ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long re@@ version period was observed in patients who have referred to therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium found twice daily for at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 of I.@@ C or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the application of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data are missing to imm@@ unity and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney disease ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as limited clinical experience for these patient population .
an early hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is before the beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a due to sufficient feeding of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of its rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone tumor , a temporary , mit@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop , whose maximum is usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium found twice daily for at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer ( chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ro@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered a dental treatment with a reasonable degree of dental treatment .
for patients who require dental surgery , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opathy in or@@ tho@@ don@@ tics .
the clinical assessment of the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit of risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced to A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s application in accordance with the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the sever@@ ity of adverse events in the cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the total balance of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney failure Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid has been associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure , in connection .
the change of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were similar in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um of ser@@ um @-@ cancer within 10 days after the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo over 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory results , the temporary as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values carried out below the normal sw@@ elling range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , with 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study , compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the morning @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a fra@@ cture and in the mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avo@@ iding clinical frac@@ tures after a recently exp@@ iring check@@ up , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ Aci@@ d in a large clinical study was reported by local reactions on in@@ fusion , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic region , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in or@@ tho@@ don@@ tics ) , reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs for local infections , including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports based on cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients entered oste@@ o@@ arthritis in a jaw area with an A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and a plac@@ ebo treated with plac@@ ebo .
in case of an over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , can be achieved compensation of oral calcium and / or an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical effectiveness in treating the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once per year was performed in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone di@@ cht@@ e@@ jection or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing body @-@ structure .
effects on morph@@ ometric sp@@ inal det@@ ects A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or several new sp@@ inal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and over had a 60 % reduction in body frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hil@@ frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reported an equal effect on three years , which resulted in an increase of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for mag@@ nific@@ ance .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density on the lum@@ ber vert@@ eb@@ ur@@ ic acid , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment significantly compared to all periods ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % increase in the bone density of the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ral column by 6.7 % , of the entire hips by 6.0 % , the enk@@ ran@@ ge@@ as by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
Kno@@ k@@ enh@@ ist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic floor .
a micro @-@ computer@@ ized analysis ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the tra@@ fer@@ ment bone @-@ volume and ob@@ taining of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone @-@ architecture in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of type IO@@ C ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the period of study .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months , reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the output level after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output level of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was maintained at 55 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 in E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study , increased A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to the plac@@ ebo treatment of the BM@@ D at all points of time and counter@@ parts .
in comparison to the plac@@ ebo treatment the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment was increased by 5.4 % in comparison to the plac@@ ebo treatment and 4,3 % of the total assets .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study were random@@ ized 508 men , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical fac@@ tions was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % on plac@@ ebo .
another study in males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) was once an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to a weekly gift from al@@ end@@ ron@@ at to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ wir@@ l @-@ BM@@ D compared to 24 months in comparison to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in people and patients at age 30 years with radi@@ ologically proven , especially easy to deal with severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of cra@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was proved in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain impact was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified as responsibilities under the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
the therapeutic approach was observed from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , compared to 71 the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , compared with 71 who were treated with cra@@ ed@@ ron@@ at in a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , which proved to be independent .
after that , the plasma be@@ eps quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the peak .
rapid bi@@ enni@@ al dis@@ appearance from the big cycle with half @-@ life cycle t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ years 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a terminal elim@@ ination period of ½ litres 146 hours .
the early distribution stages ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion about the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose of urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the whole body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentrations by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma cent@@ ric at time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance of Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ic acid is unlikely to met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 studied patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this gives that a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function , down to a cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min , no dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid requires .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Tak@@ eover ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the committee is evaluated for Human@@ ity &apos;s Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) to get recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( in particular over@@ weigh@@ ting patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabet@@ es@@ medication ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another type of diabetes ( ar@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( in particular over@@ weigh@@ ed patients ) , the met@@ form@@ in can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ ated dose alone .
in combination with a sul@@ fa drugs or insulin , the existing dose of sul@@ fa drugs can be retained , except for patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ leu@@ k@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fa drugs or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better utiliz@@ ed and decre@@ ases blood sugar levels , making type 2 diabetes better .
for more than 1 400 patients the activity of acet@@ one in tri@@ ple@@ therapy were examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ fa drugs , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the study the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ col hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how good blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which states that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the impact of the additional contribution of acet@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fa drugs showed up by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo carried a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , a lower@@ ing of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % to those patients who took plac@@ ebo additionally .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual acu@@ ity , infections of upper respir@@ atory tract infection , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced sensitivity to m@@ aturing ) .
Ac@@ tos can not be applied to patients or potentially allergic ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency and diabet@@ ic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ z ( high acid level - ac@@ id@@ spar - in the blood ) .
it has been decided to implement Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the single use ) as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 , the European Commission proposed Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited granted an approval to enter Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white and whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient with insulin and in@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ ations due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
there are no data available for use in patients under 18 years of age , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attacks or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart failure ) , the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest possible dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or ec@@ lo@@ me , especially those with reduced kar@@ di@@ al reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ec@@ lo@@ me , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ovas@@ cular out@@ comes study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced pain@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports about heart failure occurred , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality .
patients with increased output gap ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm ) or other signs of liver disease may not be used .
if AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range , the metast@@ ases will soon be able to check again as soon as possible .
if a patient symptoms develop , identify with a he@@ pat@@ itis , such as un@@ clear nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , harmon@@ izing pain , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dark har@@ n , are to check the liver values .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is continued , should be directed to the laboratory parameters of clinical evaluation .
clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has been demonstrated a dos@@ ages of weight gain , which may stir in fat deposits and in some cases with a fluid re@@ tention .
as a result of a ha@@ iling from the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a minor reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.8 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin by 3.6 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ atology ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin @-@ ins@@ ens@@ ity , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is a oral and triple combination therapy with sul@@ fa drugs or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dos@@ cope independent hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia .
after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported on an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of diabet@@ ic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ p with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear if there are direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ar@@ act , when patient report on disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone breeding , random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated structure of frac@@ tures was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years , with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women that were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study , a study of 3.5 years to study cardi@@ ovas@@ cular events , frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ ctions per 100 patients ) in patients that were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if one patient wishes a pregnancy or an adult , the treatment is ab@@ sent ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies in investigation of interaction effects have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with pharmac@@ euticals to met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium @-@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ins are not expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with the anter@@ ior chamber ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on about 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ tor ) resulted in a lower@@ ing of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is the result that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin @-@ resist@@ ence in the pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the killing growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data not in@@ valuable ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ or and the refra@@ ction of the lens , as they are also observed in other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ stie@@ ge performed on the thre@@ e@@ fold threshold of the norm range frequently as under Plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ isons @-@ groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fa drugs .
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency was 1.6 % higher than under Plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or her .
since the market launch , seldom about heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been reported , more frequently if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has been used in combination with insulin or patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone breeding are random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7.@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in the over a period of 3.5 years @-@ running PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study , frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in taking the maximum recommended dose of 120 mg / day over four days , after 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator and Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin model of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glu@@ cose production in the liver and increase periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ ms in the event of insulin @-@ resist@@ ence .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus g@@ lic@@ ited as mon@@ otherapy has been carried out over two years to study the time until desc@@ end of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained due to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ sufficient for insulin , were random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients below Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the medium H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to those patients who continue to receive insulin ; a reduction of the insulin dose associated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statist@@ ically significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ ents showed a statist@@ ically significant decrease in comparison to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week examination to type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction in the plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol and minor , however , clin@@ ically significant increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol is observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ ia gly@@ ca@@ ine and the free fatty acids in comparison to plac@@ ebo and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to plac@@ ebo under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , no statist@@ ically significant increase of LD@@ L cholesterol was observed , while under the met@@ form@@ in and lic@@ ited values , values were observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , this also has an effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de absorption , as well as to the fle@@ ece tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study , a cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ized to either a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardi@@ ovas@@ cular therapy either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , with top concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ action studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ - and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral use of radio@@ active lab@@ elled pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and found a lower degree in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination time of imm@@ utable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and those of the entire active metabol@@ ites is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plasma cent@@ ric of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower than healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of mother substances are similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys co@@ inci@@ de in accordance with the repeated agreement plasma volume magni@@ fication with ha@@ em@@ esis , an@@ emia , and reversible electro@@ ly@@ ph@@ ie .
this is due to the result that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin @-@ resist@@ ency of the parent , which reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the killing growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ plas@@ ia ( male and female rats ) were induc@@ ed in male and female rats .
in a animal model of family @-@ omat@@ por@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces led to an increased incidence of col@@ loqui@@ um .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to explo@@ it the insulin is effective .
the study was measured after 12 weeks concentration of a substance ( gly@@ col hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how good blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that hin@@ ts the blood sugar levels similar to another human@@ ism .
acet@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients which may react over@@ sus@@ cep@@ tible ( allergic ) to human acts ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
furthermore , cans of tra@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted , if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is to be taken out ) .
the Committee on Human@@ ity P@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should be conc@@ e@@ aled in the treatment of diabetes towards the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for placing Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a quick initial effect is used together with lasting effect .
the injection pin must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , the hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia war@@ nings may be altered and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of starch , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( insulin , insulin , insulin or insulin delivery method ) , type of insulin ( insulin or insulin or insulin delivery method ) , can result in a change of dosage needed .
if switching to acet@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose adjustment is necessary , this may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with which hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emic reactions produced after a change of animal insulin shots , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ tic leu@@ k@@ emia were less pronounced or other than with their previous insulin .
before travel , who should go beyond several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to enter the advice of his doctor , as such voy@@ ages may be used , that insulin and meals must be taken and taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider potential inter@@ actions in therapy and its patients are always question@@ ed to others by them .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may also be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for placing Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the EU &apos;s entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when two types of insulin are shu@@ ff@@ led , first the amount of insulin must be increased first , then the amount of the insulin delivery .
3 . when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , a dose adjustment is required during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travel , who should go beyond several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to enter the advice of his doctor , as such voy@@ ages may be used , that insulin and meals must be taken and taken at other times .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients suffering from arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in joints ) or tox@@ in notes ( &quot; stones , i.e. greater ure@@ tic deposits that may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the acid level increases after two to four weeks still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ it@@ ers , the dose may be increased once daily for a daily 120 mg .
during the first treatment months , still gre@@ dients can still occur ; therefore , patients may take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of gyp@@ sy sei@@ zu@@ res .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation , as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , on the 1@@ 0@@ 72 patients were recorded , the efficacy of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo ) and of Al@@ lo@@ scar@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for treating hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with 7@@ 62 patients each with al@@ lo@@ scar@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ scar@@ in@@ ol was used twice daily in a dose of 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems were only received 100 mg per day .
the main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid level was below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ic in a dose of once daily charged 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily had a level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ scar@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients were under plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart problems could possibly affect increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee on Human@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ov@@ ic was more effective in the blood @-@ oxid@@ ation in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ scar@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases which have already led to u@@ bi@@ al deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently present gi@@ en@@ tions and / or a gi@@ raffe ) .
if the ser@@ um acidity can still be used after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ L / l ) , a dose increase of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
patients with severe kidney function limits were not fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and young adults have no experiences yet with children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .

liver disease during clinical trials of phase 3 , slight ab@@ normal@@ ities of liver function values were observed in patients with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the beginning of the Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ line treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ oph@@ yl@@ line Z@@ did not have been performed effective studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O in@@ hibition of the@@ oph@@ yl@@ lin@@ ation can result ( in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ oph@@ yl@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .

in a study of subjects covered 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C by Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak ch@@ oral effect from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide contains a decline of 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C is produced .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed an@@ cies cannot include side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
un@@ experimental studies allow not to close direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be c@@ auti@@ ous during the tax of a vehicle , serving machines or on the exercise of dangerous activities , until they can be reas@@ on@@ ably safe that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC is not affected their performance .
a number of higher incidence of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular events was observed in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al study in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al study in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al study ( 1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statist@@ ically significant differences could be found and no problem related to Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ kl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or de@@ fi@@ ant heart failure in the medical history .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two piv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were carried out with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy of efficacy was in each study of patients , in which the last three month @-@ specific ser@@ um mut@@ ation was &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ L / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 150 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment to study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ scar@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statist@@ ically significant over@@ flow of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ scar@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were collected for the analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ scar@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the decrease of the ser@@ um acid focus was observed at &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ L / l ) during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently retained for the treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function limits The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restri@@ ction ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acidity concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acidity concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um acid level was revealed to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ g / l ) in 16 @-@ 24 of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a displac@@ ement ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for treating oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease , where the bones are frag@@ ile ) in women after men@@ opause , in which there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before food , drinking , or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and Vit@@ amins supplements ) .
in order to avoid an irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take place until after the first meal of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to im@@ itate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 weeks treatment , the patient &apos;s share was treated with the low vitamin D levels in the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than with those who solely receive al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate income ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE does exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system such as stomach pain , diarr@@ he@@ a ( diarr@@ he@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ ho@@ e ( diarr@@ he@@ a ) , ul@@ cer ( bl@@ asted stomach ) , tri@@ mm@@ ed ab@@ domin@@ als ( bl@@ asted stomach ) and Sau@@ res .
in patients with any hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it must not be used in the ill@@ nesses of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium mirror ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright in at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ comple@@ mentary food ) for the day .
the following tips are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed up after the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not che@@ w or put the tablet into the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet for 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ ep@@ tic Ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal bleeding or surgical intervention in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , except special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
inflamm@@ ation reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , seldom followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were used in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( some were severe and required a hospital . )
the doctor should therefore point out attentive to all signs and symptoms which are to be pointed out on possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain at swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ inal pain , or dis@@ gu@@ ile the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that take on a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing assign@@ ments are passed to patients and to be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
during large clinical trials with alt@@ end@@ ron@@ at , there was no increased risk associated with alt@@ end@@ ron , were rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ en- and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and severe complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ opathy is commonly reported in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) in cancer patients , whose therapeutic eg@@ anim@@ e contains intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the use of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require an inc@@ and@@ ar surgical procedure which di@@ min@@ ished the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the pine .
the clinical assessment by the treated doctor is important for therapy planning on each patient basis of an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instru@@ cted to take the pill to the dose of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet to the next morning after confir@@ ming their exp@@ atri@@ ation .
they should not take two tablets at the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the given day of the week .
other ill@@ nesses that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated before the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when taken at the same time .
therefore patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see section 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a multitude of usually prescribed drugs , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither while the pregnancy is still used by pregnant women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication to directly harm the effects of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opathy was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ians ; most of the reports origin@@ ate from cancer patients , however , was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um of ser@@ um cal@@ ci@@ ums were up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ ates up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at due to an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ at@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , gast@@ ritis or Ul@@ zer@@ a .

adv@@ ent adult patients is administered to those who transplan@@ t kidney or liver to prevent a rep@@ ul@@ sion of transplan@@ ted organs by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously used studies using Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study involving 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation was presented , and the application of Section with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indic@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients who was torn down after a duration of a year ( by example a renewed transplan@@ tation or a res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , more recent studies have been carried out in 119 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how to report a paragraph when compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only doctors that are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation , should make this medicine sort or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to clinical @-@ relevant differences in system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ fts of transplan@@ tation or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immune diseases .
patients should always retain the same tac@@ tic form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ations of form@@ ulation or the regime should be carried out only under the mut@@ iny of an experienced medical device ( see section 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of an conversion to an alternative wording , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dos@@ ing of adv@@ ances should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability based on blood levels ( see below ) recommendations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Del@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ es should be controlled from conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposition was measured as a mirror @-@ level , with both form@@ ations both in kidney and kidney transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate sequ@@ encing phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ oc@@ ate Dos@@ age can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case the condition of the patient is not permitted in the first postoperative surgery , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment is intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For the supp@@ ression of transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
recommended Dos@@ age recommendation - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of patients after transplan@@ tation .
recommended Dos@@ age recommendation - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on advoc@@ ate must needs a transplan@@ t recommended by two daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to once daily intake of adv@@ ances , so this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the entire daily dose to take place .
kidney transplan@@ tation After an conversion from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ va to en@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral and liver transplan@@ tation suggested daily for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
in case of adult transplan@@ t , adult patients who are to be notified will be an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day every day in the morning .
other transplan@@ ts , however , has no clinical experience with advanced , pan@@ cre@@ as and transplan@@ ted patients , was observed in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ ages in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a her@@ ab@@ ment of the dose .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Da the kidney function has no effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dos@@ ise adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cells , a calculation of the cre@@ atine plant and a monitoring of urea ) is recommended .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to an article When the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see section 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the projection mirror in full blo@@ t The dose should be primarily based on the clinical ass@@ essing of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability under the loss of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ es checks .
it is recommended to perform common controls of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ es of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be revers@@ ed after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ancement , changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapies or while simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us perfection ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Rev@@ eal is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State is step@@ ped .
data on clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ t@@ ations usually within the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney , and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ t , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ tation or other side effects , which may occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always retain the same tac@@ tic form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ations of form@@ ulation or the regime should only be conducted under the mut@@ iny of an experienced medical device ( see section 4.2 , 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t break@@ ages , proved to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ va as a therap@@ ist , there are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation .
to proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ fts of gra@@ fts in adult heart transplan@@ t and transplan@@ tation in children &apos;s childhood are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation .
due to potential inter@@ actions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of clinical effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , is the intake of herbal remedy ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or to avoid other vegetable remedi@@ es during treatment with agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , there are a very careful monitoring of tac@@ tics concentrations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to considerable variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases it was referred to as Pro@@ gra@@ f one as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , Chamber - or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ie , which can therefore also occur under notice .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical symptoms are already existing heart disease , hyper@@ tension , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ load and oil .
like other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ va , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor .
when patient , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pre@@ aches like head@@ aches , changing levels of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision disorders , should be a radical study ( e.g. ) .
because advoc@@ ate hard capsules , ret@@ ards , l@@ act@@ ose included , is advis@@ able in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary Gal@@ act@@ ose in@@ suff@@ er@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glu@@ cose g@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption special caution .
simultaneous use of drugs or herbal medic@@ inal products , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , and thus reduce blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore advis@@ able to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood level in the con@@ current gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism to maintain constant concentration levels ( see section 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction with anti@@ fung@@ y@@ ika such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid anti@@ biot@@ ic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal metabolism .
high @-@ dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute deter@@ rent reactions , can increase or lower concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ A4 , which will affect met@@ abolic damage .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the clearing of ster@@ oid contra@@ ep@@ tives , and thus reducing hormon@@ al exposure , is particularly c@@ auti@@ ous in decisions on ease of contrac@@ eption .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of a small number of exam@@ inations on transplan@@ tation cancer gives no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ va a higher risk for undes@@ ired events of the course and the result of pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine and 83 % in the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis in comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % at Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients that were surrounded by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases where there was no acute transplan@@ t break@@ age was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) during the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group larger ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ splan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in one study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis obl@@ iter@@ ate syndrome was significantly lower in patients with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients .
Pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ t A multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral pro@@ pane was carried out on 205 patients , which were also subjected to a random@@ ised process of pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation , which were random@@ ized to a random@@ ised procedure Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us amounted to 0.2 mg / kg / day and thereafter , to reach the targeted valley level from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .

this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed out completely met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed from the discharge , but the discharge is mainly carried out over the g@@ all .
for stable patients receiving by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in proportion to the total daily dose , system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was charged close to 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a deficiency caused by factor VIII , con@@ genital blood disorder ) .
the dos@@ ing and frequency of application are then alig@@ ned if an Adv@@ ance is applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding associated with surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles , or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method used as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell which was enabled to create a gene ( DNA ) that it is capable of formation of the human ear factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made different , so that the drug may not contain human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe and moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the drug use was examined by prevention of bleeding as well as surgical intervention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 have been rated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events of adv@@ ent ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies to factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate must not be used in patients which may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against human ear factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ oids , or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG approved approval for placing Adv@@ ate in the EU &apos;s entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dos@@ age The dosage and duration of subst@@ itution therapy is directed after the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ defect , after the place and the extent of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age and clinical condition of patients .
the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic event the factor of VIII activity in the corresponding period is not to drop under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repe@@ ating for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repe@@ ating until the risk of patients is over .
during treatment course it is used to controlling the administered dose and frequency of injec@@ tions a reasonable determin@@ ing factor of VIII @-@ Plas@@ mask .
single patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and exhibit various se@@ wer@@ ies .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ i cannot be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out if necessary to im@@ itate an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor of VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be considered .
after checking the patient , the administration rate should not be exceeded , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII directed Ig@@ G Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine that are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk depends on the first 20 ex@@ positions on the biggest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ eric @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the re@@ occur of ( lowest tit@@ res ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
because of the rare emergence of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A at women lie above the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and still no experiences .
the A@@ DR@@ s of the patients occurring in the greatest number of patients showed an increased risk of inhibit@@ ors , a higher risk for formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever , and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data not in@@ valuable ) .

based on the data available since the initial author@@ ization , CH@@ MP still has a positive rating , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided to apply for the Author@@ isation holder in 5 years another extension procedure should apply .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited shared the Human@@ ity Committee ( CH@@ MP ) officially distributed that the company res@@ ume its application for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer .
normally , the breast , brain , bones , or female parts ( fabrics that links other structures in the body are affected and supported ) of it .
this is a kind of virus that was genet@@ ically modified so that it can carry a gene on the body &apos;s cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has been changed so it cannot produce copies of itself and thus no infections can trigger from humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus facilitate the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from the non @-@ defect in the human body &apos;s p@@ 53 gene , usually carries out damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in front of the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the area of lower @-@ building , in bones and brain .
after CH@@ MP , the questions of the company presented on the questions , were still un@@ solved .
based on the assessment of the initial dos@@ sier , the CH@@ MP is created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP opinion has not been adequ@@ ately proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of drug .
in addition , the company had not been adequ@@ ately proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in reliable manner and that it is neither responsible for the environment for people who are in close contact with the patient .
the company didn &apos;t inform the CH@@ MP , if the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified active @-@ release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( hypo@@ cr@@ amps , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nose @-@ mu@@ g@@ inal sw@@ elling ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
for adults and teen@@ agers over 12 years the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice daily a tablet , which should be consumed completely with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , and once the symptoms occur , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be im@@ pe@@ eled down on the nose .
the main effective measures were the sever@@ ity of the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cr@@ ite symptoms that were reported by the patient before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried their symptoms all 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
symptoms of hypo@@ cr@@ abs symptoms except the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % , compared with 3@@ 5,@@ 9 % in patients who kills P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients suffering from Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a relief of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ ik@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic ( heart hunt ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ x@@ ie , di@@ lution , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be used in patients that might be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ al agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine to treat aller@@ gies ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should also not be used in patients that suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart or vas@@ cular diseases ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ roid ( hyper@@ tension ) , or have a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe company to permit a permit for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ aze on the EU &apos;s entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. excluding them to cr@@ ush or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used due to the faul@@ ts of data for imm@@ unity and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue with symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , because during long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can be taken with time .
after the reduction in sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory system the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients that are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( Mao ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ jec@@ tors such as bro@@ o@@ id@@ ol@@ amine , per@@ vas@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ c@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ pan@@ ol , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ oline etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collection and the data is not enough to discuss appropriate recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ ik@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function . the data is not enough to discuss appropriate recommendations .
patients must be informed about the treatment for treating hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or et@@ ch@@ ai@@ gen other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) .
for the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with hyper@@ tension , patients with hyper@@ tension , patients with hyper@@ tension , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in An@@ am@@ nes@@ ia .
Aer@@ in@@ ik@@ aze may susp@@ end at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise can prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce in its scale .
in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or change of plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
for the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests there were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in enzyme so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vivo CY@@ P@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
however , the in@@ consist@@ ency of application of Aer@@ in@@ ik@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , however , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies revealed no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since re@@ productions studies on animals not always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine should not be used in the pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases may result in severe cases that lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( encoding , ap@@ ne@@ a , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardi@@ ovas@@ cular col@@ lagen ) and a CN@@ S ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or , con@@ vul@@ sions ) .

a CN@@ S stimulation is especially likely in children as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dri@@ es , po@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid and - di@@ at@@ ation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 inhibit@@ ors on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
for a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement of flight power including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are connected with flies .
in controlled clinical studies , at recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day , increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine recommended in the recommended dosage may cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ bar@@ row or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 , with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , whereby 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ ik@@ aze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ ik@@ aze tablets were determined from the total amount for the symp@@ tom@@ atic ( except nas@@ al mu@@ g@@ inal sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine about the 2 weeks treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ ik@@ aze tablets in view to the sw@@ elling effect , determin@@ es using the nose @-@ mu@@ g@@ inal sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 weeks treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender , age , or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is trace@@ able within 30 minutes after administration .
following the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze on healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ z lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dos@@ cope study , which was conducted with form@@ ulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects , were noted that four subjects des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were badly modified .
a component @-@ interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine according to the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was equivalent to exposure to a aer@@ obic tablet tablet .
based on conventional studies for safety , tox@@ icity , for recur@@ r@@ itive gift , to Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for re@@ produ@@ ox@@ icity , however , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can &apos;t recognize particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine .
in re@@ productive @-@ sto@@ ic studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was in the oral administration to rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application , pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ancy system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .

A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies with seasonal aller@@ itis and two studies in patients who had also asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ ling , air@@ ment of sleep and performance in days ) before and after 6 weeks of treatment was determined .
further studies were presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to capture and melt the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children is harmless .
in case of allergy r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us were considered an average decrease in the symp@@ tom ( symp@@ tom points ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symp@@ tom climbed to six weeks treatment with a@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients which may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe company a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and urine ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited clinical trials of clinical trials for the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the previous disease , and may be res@@ umed after res@@ um@@ ing symptoms .
in persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the feeding time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were observed in the clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol was not reinforced during the initial intake of alcohol and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may result in imp@@ air@@ ment of transport or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
most commonly reported side effects , more common than the plac@@ ebo was reported ( 1,2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ wash ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ es@@ cent patients of 12 to 17 years , the most common side effects were treated with 5,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( N@@ inth clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 inhibit@@ ors on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
during a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. daily for over 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovas@@ cular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval showed .
for a single dos@@ sier study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement values , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are connected with flies .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , ap@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ ev@@ ing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis in dependence of the duration of symptoms can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
as shown by the total amount of profile for life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the intest@@ inal caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was also investigated , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , is similar to the path@@ ology in the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited .
since the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ancient idiopath@@ ic ur@@ alism is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is carried out in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria : this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of p@@ ur@@ itus and the number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose of dos@@ ages .

Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially distributed to the Human@@ ity Committee in June 2008 , that the company res@@ ume its application for the application of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and older men .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and older people to protect the flu caused by the stem ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine which should cause a trunk of influ@@ enza that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic to protect .
a influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic emerges from a new strain of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus , who can easily spread from person to human , because people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as a &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and is anti@@ bodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in the position to make contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus this master &apos;s quicker anti@@ bodies .
subsequently , the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , det@@ ects human body as a state @-@ foreign ) , cleaned up as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the scope of the clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA region for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor treating .
if you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs for the treatment of adults and children above four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to inhal@@ ation , but this cannot be used together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ Gener@@ ase should only be classified if the doctor has been examined who used an an@@ tivir@@ al drug of the patient before , and the od@@ ds has judged that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily which can be taken twice daily with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs twice daily .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drug may reduce the HIV amount in blood and holds it at a low level .
AIDS is not to heal , however , the damage to the immune system and thus also have the development of AIDS prostate infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drug , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which had previously been treated with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
it was compared with low @-@ dos@@ ed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicine A@@ Gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had previously been prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or with other prot@@ ease .
main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or the alter@@ ation of viral load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or had had more patients a viral load below 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had been treated with Prot@@ ease In@@ hibit@@ ors , only very few to their treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated early with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , this treatment with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ generic drugs are as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks when the patients who had their previous prot@@ ease .
the most common A@@ stri@@ gases ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ he@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , skin rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ general may not be used in patients which may potentially be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to am@@ big@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ Gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicine , which are the same as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines for HIV exists in patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( alter@@ ation of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the immune system ) .
the Committee for Human@@ ity P@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ generic ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee established that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously been not proven prot@@ ease .
A@@ Gener@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the EU &apos;s entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
for usual , A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic boost of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r should be taking into account of the individual viral resist@@ ence and pre@@ treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r as a solution to one capsule is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for one milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fied addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses should be applied to am@@ ni@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ grav@@ ating in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins were not studied in children .
v@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the faul@@ ts of data for imm@@ unity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily with severe liver function at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use is to be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver function with care , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ Gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs , which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ry 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements , St. Johann@@ is@@ wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may include risk reduction of reduced plasma cent@@ ric concentrations and a di@@ min@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r during the administration of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to cure HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ general , prevents the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , ate@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer chronic he@@ pat@@ itis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal course .
please read the information about this medicine for the case of a simultaneous treatment of he@@ pat@@ itis B or C .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic he@@ active he@@ pat@@ itis show a higher frequency of liver function in a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ut or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that can be confused by CY@@ P@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment of system@@ ic cor@@ rid@@ ors including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the tri@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ et function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because the ret@@ ali@@ ation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or of CY@@ P3@@ A4 is strongly affected by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of v@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis is not recommended .
4 For some medicines that may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration concentration .
for patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ Gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with am@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of interaction .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to op@@ iat@@ ure@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ation of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this form@@ ulation form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution when certain other patient groups .
A@@ Gener@@ ase should be reduced to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cu@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported on the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other ill@@ nesses needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , these were treated with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous ha@@ em@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ ost@@ asis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune defect at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflamm@@ atory reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial equi@@ e@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ rel@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width drug may not be given simultaneously with drugs , which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ry 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with drugs , their active ingredients are mainly related to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , and associated with increased plasma levels with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ big@@ u@@ r , which may cause a vi@@ ro@@ logic and lead to a resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the harvest@@ ed plas@@ mos@@ er by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , often adverse effects were observed at the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um level of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r can be harvest@@ ed by simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient records St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ on@@ ial level is and when possible to check the virus load and add the cur@@ rant .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r ( see also E@@ igh@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
clinical trials were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , which prove the effectiveness and integrity of this treatment schem@@ ati@@ as .
52 % is harvest@@ ed when Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r in plasma , that were achieved twice daily with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and infin@@ ity of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study conducted in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ a@@ zi@@ dis component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , is suggested that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and am@@ bus@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , there is no dose adjustment in combination with an o@@ ir@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with ec@@ ir@@ li@@ ence in combination with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposition of both prot@@ ease fail@@ ures would be harvest@@ ed .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing data can be dis@@ cour@@ aged that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine possibly reduces the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic Plas@@ mask .
if these medicines are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance is to be undertaken because an accurate forecast of the impact of the combination of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
simultaneous gift of am@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r and pul@@ l@@ ot@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma concentration of 193 % and thus to an increase in associated side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , c@@ eption in conjunction with A@@ Gener@@ ase will be administered to at least half the recommended dose when there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , however , plasma levels of both pharmac@@ euticals could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole at the 2.@@ 69@@ fold in comparison to the value that was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without con@@ current use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , among them also sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ A4 , may cause them to lead to inter@@ actions , possibly to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions which are monitored using these drugs , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as a@@ oh@@ ase , as it may occur to reset problems .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ sions that are known as enzyme @-@ vul@@ tures ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ating of the plasma levels of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium block@@ ages such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , ne@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of these medicines .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ Gener@@ ase may increase their plasma concentration and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ omy , vision and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate was significantly increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Kon@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ inter@@ v@@ all 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result the simultaneous gift of v@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ qu@@ ids do not recommend it , unless the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ rid@@ ors ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose coating is strongly affected by CY@@ P@@ A4 , increase plasma levels increase with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
da Plas@@ mask increases this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r .
there will be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as strongly recommended as the plasma cent@@ ric concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the same gift of am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
hence , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral taken in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while on the con@@ current use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data on simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to op@@ iat@@ ure@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
at present , no recommendation can be given due to the maximum neg@@ ligence of historic verses , such as Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
under the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not fore@@ seen , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ ine ) is recommended in the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy , in comparison with the possible risks for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected in the milk , but it is not known if Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r is over@@ taking in breast milk .
a re@@ productions study of toler@@ ant rats who was administered by feeding the uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight in the after@@ no@@ d .
further development of earnings including fertility and re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the in@@ consist@@ ency of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied for adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were easy to moderate , they were early , and rarely led to treatment sl@@ ump .
in many of these events it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV medicine or if they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where Prot@@ ease diagn@@ osing are not treated twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were viewed by the investig@@ ator in connection with the study medication , and were listed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with an re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ als and cer@@ v@@ ical fat tissue , increased intra@@ ab@@ stain@@ s and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ie , breasts and dor@@ so@@ ar fat accum@@ ulation ( bul@@ let ) .
in 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated groups that were treated with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in , over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only one case ( bul@@ let ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , previously un@@ treated patients under Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients ( 11 % ) in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin rash were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ evil or mac@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and disappeared during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ opathy were particularly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune defect at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflamm@@ atory reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , i.e. , an exception of the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and C@@ p@@ k levels , which were given in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequent .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is observed for signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , the necessary support measures are to be implemented .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a increased phenom@@ enal resistance to R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to extract the current inter@@ pret@@ ations concerning the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , the clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for ass@@ essing the activity of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates .
companies belonging to diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( part@@ itions ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain persist@@ ence against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data to cross @-@ resistance differences between Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ence , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral dis@@ continuous patients ( one of which showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ca@@ ine avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
in reverse , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a vers@@ ag@@ ious therapy is recommended to keep the accum@@ ulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can affect the subsequent treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study ( 600 mg twice daily ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ dan@@ al@@ oga ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with the lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to A@@ Gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis posed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of an un@@ bund@@ led v@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase has been used twice daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22@@ ,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was not a low @-@ dos@@ ed ra@@ is@@ i@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously administered at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data should be considered with PI @-@ treated children the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; aspir@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with PI @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered together with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake is affected , and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption was affected .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large mani@@ fold volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in plasma , showing the amount of un@@ born am@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r , which represents the active part remains unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ big@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dos@@ ing interval in the Ste@@ ady state power over the area of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .
therefore drugs must be induc@@ ed or in@@ hib@@ ited by CY@@ P@@ A4 , or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ A4 should be given if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ u@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is available from the solution 14 % less bi@@ vou@@ acs as of the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and ag@@ gregate capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low in the elim@@ ination of am@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata are comparable to Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r in mice and rats introduced he@@ pat@@ itis of he@@ pat@@ itis in mice of doses above 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r , they spoke .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ itis of the he@@ pat@@ itis and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , some hin@@ ts for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse of mut@@ ation tests , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome ab@@ err@@ atic test of human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ big@@ u@@ r neither mut@@ il@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and monitored in clinical everyday life through the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during administration of A@@ gener@@ ase still at the end of treatment .
studies about tox@@ icity at young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed both in the control and with am@@ big@@ u@@ r treated animals a high fat@@ ality .
in system@@ ic plasma exposure that was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed performance .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fied addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses should be applied to am@@ ni@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use is to be carried out in patients with weak or mild liver function with care , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration concentration .
aspir@@ ation should be set to duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cu@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk for a Li@@ er@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug ad@@ diction factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ big@@ u@@ r , which may cause a vi@@ ro@@ logic and lead to a resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
508 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r in plasma , that were achieved twice daily with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and infin@@ ity of this combination is not known .
the treatment with ec@@ ir@@ li@@ ence in combination with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposition of both prot@@ ease fail@@ ures would be harvest@@ ed .
if these medicines are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance is to be undertaken because an accurate forecast of the impact of the combination of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , c@@ auti@@ ut@@ ine must be administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half the recommended dose will be advised in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium block@@ ages such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , ne@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ pad pin , ne@@ bul@@ l@@ pin , ne@@ bul@@ pine and tox@@ icity of the medicine is increased .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate was significantly increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Kon@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ inter@@ v@@ all 82 to 89 % ) .
under the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ ver@@ mic@@ ron ) led to an acceptance of the AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r by 22 %
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy , in comparison with the possible risks for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ productions study of toler@@ ant rats who was administered by feeding the uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a reduced increase in body weight during ag@@ gra@@ ci@@ ation .
the in@@ consist@@ ency of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied for adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is observed for signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , the necessary support measures are to be implemented .
an@@ tivir@@ al activity of the HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB activity was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
in reverse , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , treatment @-@ optim@@ isation with PI @-@ treated children should be considered as expected to take into account with PI @-@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ big@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dos@@ ing interval in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s ..
therefore drugs must be induc@@ ed or in@@ hib@@ ited by CY@@ P@@ A4 , or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ A4 should be given if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al function is likely to be reduced to the elim@@ ination of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and ra@@ is@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r in mice and rats introduced he@@ pat@@ itis of he@@ pat@@ itis in mice of doses higher than 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ o@@ zone Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data on people , both from clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , some hin@@ ts for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse of mut@@ ation tests , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome ab@@ err@@ atic test of the periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes contained , was am@@ big@@ u@@ r neither mut@@ il@@ ox@@ ic .
studies about tox@@ icity at young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed both in the control and with am@@ big@@ u@@ r treated animals a high fat@@ ality .
these results suggest that in Jung@@ le the Met@@ abol@@ ism &apos;s roads are not fully mature , so that am@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r or other critical components of form@@ ulation ( z ) .
A@@ generic solution for inser@@ tion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of using R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution for inser@@ tion was neither in previously un@@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r as a solution to one capsule is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for one milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should follow as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to inser@@ tion ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there is no dose recommendation for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to use and low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided these combination with these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl pol@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competent inhibit@@ ing of this medicine and may cause severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure HIV infection , and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ general , prevents the risk of a transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International norm ratio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration concentration .
aspir@@ ation should be set to duration , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cu@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ er@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , these were treated with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous ha@@ em@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ ost@@ asis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ big@@ u@@ r , which may cause a vi@@ ro@@ logic and lead to a resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
508 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous intake of v@@ ase can increase their plasma cent@@ ric concentrations in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ech , vision and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data on data on 54 different CY@@ P@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s significantly higher plasma cent@@ ric concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to use may not be used due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained prop@@ yl pol@@ y@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .

local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take in general during therapy or reactions form after the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if due to the complaints of patients or due to severe local skin reactions , a treatment cause can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be judged after the re@@ generation of the treated skin for approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
there are currently no data over long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , for super@@ vis@@ ional bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma can be moved to other suitable therapy forms .

the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study , which points to an extended re@@ tention of drug in skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has been low after top@@ ical application of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fic@@ tive bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of the study , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased military weight ; a study carried out also four months in the study showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice was induc@@ ed at three days a week . no tum@@ ours was induc@@ ed at the point of application .
the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small system@@ ic absorption of human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk of people due to system@@ ic exposure to look very low .

the study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured in terms of reducing G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated .
in children under five years old Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was reduced the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children enrolled in the study showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , rash , pain@@ s , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to in@@ fusion .
frequent side effects in patients below five years have increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may cause patients that may react very sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will update every year all new information that may be announced , examine and check this summary if necessary .
the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is given to patients who observe al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards reactions to in@@ fusion and development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the Company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for transporting al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Eier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed to long @-@ term enzyme ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor , which has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient toler@@ ates it every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended for these patients .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended for these patients .
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any in@@ fusion which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored continuously , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical environment , where rest@@ oring equipment for medical emergen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies fought against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution ( see section 4.3 , 4.8 ) .
having a little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction , must be c@@ auti@@ ous after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a mild or moderate @-@ duty in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be sa@@ wn .
in@@ fusion can be entered with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction is occurred again .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
un@@ experimental studies allow not to direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated over breast milk , it is recommended to not satisfy during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the period of 5 years or older in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 , are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respir@@ atory system and lungs , they also occurred heavy reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath@@ ability and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
kids Un@@ wanted drug effects in relation to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at age 5 , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most cases , within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ mon version , it mostly occurred within one month ( on average after 26 days , compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , in 13 / 45 patients no antibody ass@@ ess@@ ments were shown , among them 3 patients , among which it never came to ser@@ mon version .
patients with lack of low @-@ cancer levels demonstrated a robust decrease in the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n while in patients with high antibody tit@@ res to be a variable reduction of g@@ ag at Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutr@@ alis@@ ing currency effects in vitro , which seemed to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
anti@@ bodies of anti@@ bodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse drug reactions typically fell along with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies .
the reas@@ oning for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of ac@@ cum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ates and the prevention of further accum@@ ulation provides sufficient recovery of the enzyme .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase becomes quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ i @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were random@@ ized in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the Middle phen@@ otype and only one patient proved the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an investig@@ ational exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in 6 @-@ minute walking test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received approximately 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were given an improvement in the lung function and the ability to improve in the following table .
in the open renewal study there was an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ eg@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group , as seen from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically and absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume continued to be proportional to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a he@@ pat@@ oma , 22 ( 85 % ) of the study reached normal metast@@ ases until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks there was a significant drop in the G@@ ag mirrors in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant at the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gen@@ eous clinical manifest@@ ation between patients that were taken into account by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes in five patients ( 58 % ) , was generally observed in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was performed , mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of 20 patients was investigated , at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe ins@@ ulating form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirrors at the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 e / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the mean age of the younger patients with the moderate in@@ feed form , whereas the elderly patients with severe losses were limited , limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata performed on the G@@ ag mirrors in the har@@ n , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute audit@@ ory test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be used in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , an advert@@ ised alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will assess any new information that will be published annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug are updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients at age 5 was similar to those in older and less strongly affected patients .
based on conventional studies for security resin , tox@@ icity in one @-@ time gift , tox@@ icity in repeated injection and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data do not recognize particular dangers for humans .

this register becomes long @-@ term safety and efficacy information about patients who were treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data to the natural prolifer@@ ation of disease in patients without these treatment .
in patients who suffer from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase caused the certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cer@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ) to one of the components of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if an unusual allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me using other medicines please inform your doctor if you have medicine , the chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ c@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of di@@ min@@ ed effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who can not be stretched out to other parts of the body , or is likely to easily dis@@ continue to other parts of the body . • more advanced or metastatic col@@ lung cancer who does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ium cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , combined with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously applied other chemical therap@@ ists .
to reduce side effects , patients should be taken during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and obtain injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in additionally an anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose blood count changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed up , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ ed the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents them to divide the cells .
in cancer cells , the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re is lighter than in healthy cells , resulting in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the drug and a longer period of action in cancer cells .
in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously won no chemotherapy against their condition .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ plat@@ in were aver@@ aged an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in average administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
patients who had previously obtained chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients had not affected the cell epi@@ thel@@ ial cells when administration of A@@ lim@@ ta increased longer survival times than with the compar@@ ative medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for placing A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each feed bottle must be redeemed using 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage of the Do@@ - S@@ IS is extracted and diluted with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100@@ ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , except by major plate epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in two @-@ line therapy of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , except on the out@@ man@@ sion of epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion via a period of 10 minutes on the first day of any 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion in the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion to a period of 10 minutes on the first day of any 21 day treatment course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re mixed @-@ gift as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ tical ero@@ id is given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued throughout the entire period of therapy and for further 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in one week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third duty cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , before each gift a complete blood@@ picture should be created , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a thro@@ cy@@ tot@@ al count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST &amp; S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose @-@ examination should take place at the beginning of a new treatment course under mos@@ qu@@ ito testing of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood @-@ image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
according to the recovery , patients need to be treated according to the critics in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ugly tox@@ icity of 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy with AL@@ IM@@ TA should be interrupted until the patient is in front of the treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients with 2 dos@@ ages reduced to a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 or so@@ - in the occurr@@ ence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials have no indication that in patients at age 65 , or over , in comparison to patients at age 65 , an increased side @-@ effective ad@@ ox@@ - ko is found .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to in@@ competence and effectiveness .
clinical trials were no longer necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , who recommended Dos@@ age adap@@ t@@ ations to all patients recommended Dos@@ age .
the data in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not enough ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restri@@ ction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold from the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 times of the upper limit value ( with the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( when presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not studied especially in studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to the bone mar@@ g@@ inal level and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed cannot be administered to patients , before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ count once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - Cy@@ cles once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the n@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ium , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they have observed in the previous therapy cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ ch@@ th@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity such as ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was observed when a treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore all patients need to be referred to with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ y@@ - l@@ actic measure for reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney disease ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous dose of non @-@ oxid@@ ant anti@@ ph@@ log@@ ist@@ ika ( &gt; 1,3 g ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therapy is intended for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed will need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients with whom these events appeared , have adequate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ dr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accum@@ ulation in trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ sion in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered .
5 severe cardi@@ ovas@@ cular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this ingredient is usually given in combination with another Cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , simultaneous use of lat@@ er@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ serv@@ ation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ylic acid ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid can result in a high dosage with the result of an increased sw@@ elling of side effects .
therefore , caution is advis@@ able if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data are in relation to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ time as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ -
the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ bodies and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised Ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ bodies .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected to have severe birth defects during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re is not allowed to be used during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after a carefully weak@@ ening of the utility for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the beginning to take advice regarding the sperm cell .
it is not known if P@@ em@@ et@@ re is over@@ thrown into the breast milk and unwanted effects of the killing inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

a statist@@ ically significant improvement of clinical symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant @-@ cancer symp@@ tom@@ atic was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 people ) compared with the single C@@ is@@ pla@@ - T@@ in @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms caused by improving the pul@@ mon@@ ary parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function during the time in the Control@@ lar@@ k time .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against Doc@@ el@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was driven with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( ITT n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival in patients with NSC@@ LC came in favour of patients with NSC@@ LC ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progres@@ sion @-@ free survival ) was similar to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analysis of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination against the gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .

the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ing ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without the pro@@ - shower quality is imp@@ aired .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low cal@@ orie , gre@@ asy food .
patients who take all@@ i and can &apos;t list weight loss after 12 weeks , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , they can &apos;t waste some fats in the food , making about a quarter of the fats needed with food un@@ d@@ owed to the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to plac@@ ebo .
in both studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg at the taking of plac@@ ebo .
in the study of all@@ i patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no loss of weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side @-@ effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ es@@ cent stain@@ s on after , fl@@ as ( win@@ ch ) with chair , sto@@ cky / o@@ yst@@ ic chair , walking / o@@ ily chair ( compart@@ ments ) , flat@@ ness ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients suffering from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ of transplan@@ tation in transplan@@ tation ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
furthermore , it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or in cholesterol ( a liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the transport of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , gre@@ asy food .
all@@ i can not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , because there are not sufficient data toward efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , is necessary in elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or one of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chronic fatigue syndrome ( see Section 4.6 ) • St@@ aying time ( see section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies ( see section 4.5 , 4.8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase when all@@ i is taken together with a fat wide ground or ob@@ ese diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes with improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a doctor against diabetes , before beginning of therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabet@@ ic may need to be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional pregnant contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a dro@@ pping of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in Plas@@ mask .
for use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.8 ) .
with most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as the beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins were in the norm range .
however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amine before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vit@@ amine intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
following the gift of a disposable dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , at a limited number of volunteers , the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration was observed at a limited number of volunteers .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and impos@@ e with pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data not in@@ valuable ) .
the incidence of known side effects , which were noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety linked to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days of normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of or@@ list@@ at reported cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dos@@ ing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human beings and animal experiments can be attributed to a quick reg@@ ression of any system@@ ic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ passive properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg orbit , taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 affect the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oral , gre@@ asy food .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of mar@@ g@@ om@@ ization ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those who have lost more than 10 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction over 12 months has been observed , the biggest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
average change in total chol@@ est@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol tot@@ aled 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

plasma concentration of non @-@ met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ ur@@ able for 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , therapeutic dos@@ ages were not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by therapeutic dos@@ ages in plasma and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ n@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , which administered minimum system@@ ic res@@ or@@ ized dose , M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ si@@ fied Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after graduation of the N @-@ mol@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , identified nearly 42 % of the total plas@@ ia concentration .

Alo@@ xi is used for chemical therapy , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , which are the trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by an additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because the effects in this age group are not enough information .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
al@@ xi was investigated in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy with chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi , were no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chemotherapy with chemotherapy and vom@@ iting for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron . ( 127 von 185 ) .
compared to Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company in Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to canc@@ er@@ ous disease and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ation cancer due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , induc@@ ed by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding one prior to the chemotherapy @-@ given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the thick@@ et of col@@ le@@ facts , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ serving or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection can be monitored .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able at the same gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with pharmac@@ euticals to pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or that lead to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy with another chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics @-@ gift , Alo@@ xi is not used for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hib@@ ited the activity of the five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic inter@@ actions occurred between a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
a significant impact of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , fluor@@ op@@ eri@@ x , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , lat@@ ox@@ et@@ u@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience on applying Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not necessary , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used when pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the doctor &apos;s doctor .
clinical trials were the most common for a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observed effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reaction and reactions at the administration location ( burning , curing , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar amounts of unwanted events such as in other do@@ si@@ ev@@ isions were observed ; there were no dose action relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , however , due to the great distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for an al@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients were obtained with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 ( half @-@ time ) or 100 mg of on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time ) received , which was given an intra@@ ven@@ ous day 1 without exam@@ inations .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients were obtained with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to the 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , given an intra@@ ven@@ ous day at day 1 .
results of studies involving oc@@ al@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are sum@@ med up in the following tables .
in clinical trials for chemotherapy @-@ induc@@ ed nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the intra@@ cellular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ el vent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of action potential .
the aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was given to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift arises on an initial decrease in the plasma concentration of a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average set time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the whole dose range from 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in a healthy and cancer dos@@ si@@ ent dos@@ si@@ proportional .
according to the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans was measured in 11 ho@@ den@@ ial patients between day 1 and day 5 measured by the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations , it emerges from once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days , full exposure of 0.@@ 75 mg measured , but was the C@@ max after the one @-@ time tax of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % of the kidneys will be eliminated and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic rate compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vitro studies for met@@ abolic have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ aks CY@@ P@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 have been involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours of the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single @-@ time PCR @-@ injection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function problems the termin@@ ale eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ ale and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in previous studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposition which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 According to clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only accum@@ ulate in very high concentrations of ion channels that can also be involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose ) was given in about the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure of the human liver , led to an increased frequency of liver tumor , endo@@ kr@@ all@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , an@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully familiar , but because of the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for unique use , the relev@@ ance of these results will be low evaluated .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ity P@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative approval in which the drug approved for the treatment of Hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of he@@ pat@@ itis C ( 6 million IE / ml In@@ jection Solution ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is similar to a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same practical effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) he@@ pat@@ itis C ( a virus infection caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic study the liver tissue is damage , and the values of the cir@@ u@@ ine al@@ an@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ he@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on submitted data to the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy at he@@ pat@@ itis C ) .
in the study of patients with he@@ pat@@ itis C , the effectiveness of alp@@ he@@ on was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of altogether 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns are not made so far , that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug @-@ market@@ able drug may not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with he@@ pat@@ itis C who spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting up treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease increased in more patients than with the reference drug ; also Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from that , the test used in the study was to investig@@ ate the medicine a immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for treatment of Imp@@ et@@ igo ( one with cru@@ de formation of her@@ ed@@ itary infection ) and small in@@ modified Laz@@ ar@@ ations , de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation and se@@ wn w@@ ounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been demonstr@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go is not effective against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not speak after two to three days of treatment , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial cells ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the primary indi@@ ces of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was canc@@ eled at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke on the treatment .
for the treatment of infected skin irrit@@ ated Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response : when the results of both studies were taken in skin care , about 90 % of patients were treated to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was observed in the treatment of ab@@ sz@@ essen ( o@@ id@@ ated cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or from infections that have been demonstr@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Internal Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin inf@@ ec@@ tions over@@ weigh the risks : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ations , de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation or se@@ wn w@@ ounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for transport of Al@@ tar@@ go on the EU &apos;s entire European Union .
the patients with which no improvement is shown within two to three days should be investigated once again and considered an alternative therapy in consideration ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sen@@ sibility or serious local irrit@@ ation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled to carefully con@@ strain the oint@@ ment and to have an adequate alternative therapy of the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in secondary studies were the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , in@@ sufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered when a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment is no improvement or a deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the impact of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to small plasma cent@@ ric concentrations , which have been achieved after top@@ ical application on poor skin or infected superf@@ icial w@@ ounds , there is a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing in vivo ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

due to the low system@@ ic exposure of top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tions do not be required if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during an system@@ ic treatment using CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and in@@ sufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin inf@@ ec@@ tures that Al@@ tar@@ go was reported was the most common irrit@@ ation of irrit@@ ation at the administration of approximately 1 % of patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of p@@ id@@ rom@@ util@@ ine , a substance that is ins@@ ulated by fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action from Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective in@@ hibition of the bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acts anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the ten@@ dering branch of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ tide @-@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
by ties to this bond , P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine in@@ hibit the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transportation , partially P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection processes should appear , an advice should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of a non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of trun@@ ks with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was taken 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be a day under oc@@ clu@@ sion on int@@ act and un@@ sc@@ aled skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary w@@ ounds , single plasma samples were won .
sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of the people after top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be to 200 c@@ m2 down to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism In vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily convey@@ ed by CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out more than 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

there were neither male enhancement in female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby the highest estimated exposure of the people ( top@@ ical application has been reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ) for a reduced skin :
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study in rats were observed at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development tools ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed os@@ si@@ fication ) and matern@@ al tox@@ icity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between one and 15 years , who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used within a frame of two doses of existing vacc@@ ination , and a protection against he@@ pat@@ itis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is only used when Immun@@ ization exists a low risk of he@@ pat@@ itis B infection , which can be taken out of two doses of existing vacc@@ ination .
if an over@@ dose is desired to he@@ pat@@ itis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or a other he@@ pat@@ itis or B vaccine can be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines seem to teach by the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it can defend against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detect the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vacc@@ inated vacc@@ ination since 1996 and has been registered under the vacc@@ ination of a vacc@@ ination since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same ill@@ nesses , however , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix children are given in a frame of three doses of existing vacc@@ ination .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix package include identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults are also used as proof for the Ambi@@ rix application .
the main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody conc@@ ent@@ ric in one month after the final injec@@ tions .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection for Hepatitis A and B in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that at the Ambi@@ rix degree , the degree of protection was similar in a six @-@ month distance between injection .
the most common side @-@ effects from Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appet@@ ite , pain at the injection , red@@ ness , mat@@ s ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix is allowed to react to the active agents ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ biot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ et@@ s.@@ a. a permit for the business of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the stand@@ ar@@ pf@@ lat@@ ometer with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is administered at the date of choice , and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a r@@ ink@@ age is requested for he@@ pat@@ itis A as well as for he@@ pat@@ itis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ ine vacc@@ ines or with a combination filler .
the anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis virus ( anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis ) anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ bodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ine vacc@@ ines .
it &apos;s not fully assured if imm@@ competent individuals who have referred to a he@@ pat@@ itis @-@ aging in@@ oc@@ ulation , an ab@@ r@@ ink@@ age is necessary as protection , because they may also be protected in no more det@@ ectable anti@@ bodies by immune memory .
3 As with all injection @-@ sim@@ ulations should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction after the gift of vacc@@ ination . medical treatment and monitoring is always available immediately .
if a fast protection against he@@ pat@@ itis B is necessary , the stand@@ ar@@ sch@@ ema is also recommended to combine the 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated he@@ pat@@ itis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B .
no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ anti@@ bodies under the risk of the immune system , so that the gift of other vaccine doses may be required in these cases .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a subtle implic@@ ations , these injection systems should be avoided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected directly at the Ambi@@ rix , as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular contribution to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix in the second year in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mass m@@ um@@ - m@@ um@@ er vaccine , was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that perhaps no adequate response response is achieved .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 vacc@@ ination doses of this form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the frequency , which was observed in earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ically and pre@@ servative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines at the Ambi@@ rix were given at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years the Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ ins combination @-@ sim@@ ulations .
only exceptions were the higher number of pain and mat@@ ures on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination at Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the contribution of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % of subjects at the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses of combination hydrogen .
according to the complete vacc@@ cycle , 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects , that Ambi@@ rix had given them , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination filler .
however , the frequency of mat@@ isation , however , was comparable ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9,6 % of subjects who were Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % for subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses of combination sweet@@ ener ) .
the frequency of dist@@ orted pain and mat@@ ures was low and comparable to that after administration of the combination @-@ made vaccine was observed with the 3 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ination .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ines the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ is group comparable to which with the 3 @-@ doses of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated he@@ pat@@ itis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant pat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen was observed .
in the 6 to 11 year old , according to vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a common appearance of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , was not reported per volume .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines , which reported over severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ines using the Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ doses of in@@ active he@@ pat@@ itis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen , was not different .
in clinical trials , performed at vacc@@ ines at age between 1 and including 15 years , ser@@ mon rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,1 % were administered one month after the first dose and 100 % of a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( d. h in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ mon rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - up to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined simulation with three doses .
when the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ations were observed ( SP in the table below ) against he@@ pat@@ itis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed material significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ines ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , or a 3 @-@ doses of vaccine with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated he@@ pat@@ itis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant pat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen .
among people who were at the time of the Grun@@ dim@@ mun@@ ization between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ anti@@ bodies were detected at least 24 months after imm@@ unity with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immune response to both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens , which according to vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination @-@ sim@@ ulated he@@ pat@@ is@@ it@@ is@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant he@@ pat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen in a dos@@ ed volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies are comparable to immun@@ ization in 0 @-@ 6 months , vacc@@ ination is to be found in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
if the first dose is at the second year , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the time of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza @-@ vacc@@ ines ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ RNA @-@ vacc@@ ination , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was adequate .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current form@@ ulation in adults showed the present form@@ ulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ation@@ - and ser@@ mon rates as for former form@@ ulation .
the vaccine is shown both before and after the reset to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state char@@ itable allocation of a state laboratory or one for the purpose author@@ ised laboratory is carried out .

the he@@ pat@@ itis B virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways as by bathing in water @-@ cont@@ am@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may cause a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not protect completely from an infection with he@@ pat@@ itis or he@@ pat@@ itis B virus , even when the full vacc@@ ines was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected with he@@ pat@@ itis or he@@ pat@@ itis B virus before serving both vacc@@ ines , or he@@ pat@@ itis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those of he@@ pat@@ itis or he@@ pat@@ itis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ biot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction may express itself by it@@ ching skin rash , breath not or sw@@ elling of the facial or throat . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against he@@ pat@@ itis A or Hepatitis B . • If you have / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against he@@ pat@@ itis B , i.e. within 6 months and prior to the un@@ intended appointment of the second vacc@@ ination period ) .
in a possible risk of infection with he@@ pat@@ itis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend 3 injec@@ tions of a combined he@@ pat@@ itis / he@@ pat@@ itis B vaccine with a reduced be@@ he@@ pat@@ itis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced he@@ pat@@ itis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant he@@ pat@@ itis B @-@ surface anti@@ gens .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced content of effective stock is usually taken a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination before finishing the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix are in people suffering from heavy blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / her child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your own body &apos;s own immune system , or if you / her child will be supp@@ ressed / under@@ taking .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons may not be enough , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Give your doctor if you / your child may take another medicine / take ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescri@@ ption ) or if your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / or im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) have been given to / has or this is planned in the near future .
but it can be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not enough and therefore the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as different limbs .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or after an injection of im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not given , except it is urgent to he@@ pat@@ itis B and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ biot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on data that have been announced since issu@@ ance of the first official approval , CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was released in circulation ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited because of small patients .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of a month with complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ph@@ ic or hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentration ) in history .
ammon@@ y@@ aps - split up to several single doses at meals - s@@ lu@@ red , mixed with food or through a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ chi@@ ves ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a no@@ str@@ ation ( by the nose into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
there was no compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ y@@ liqu@@ or could not be compared with other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ y@@ liqu@@ or can also lead to loss of appet@@ ite , depression , irrit@@ ation , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , fluid re@@ tention , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee on Human@@ ity P@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that ammon@@ ium in patients with the distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urea cycle was effectively prevented .
ammon@@ y@@ liqu@@ or has been under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; as due to the condition of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine .
the commitment is indicated in all patients where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel has already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ shaped form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ atic , which manifest@@ ed after the first life of life ) there is an indication for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ glyc@@ emic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , considering the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and with an adult body weight and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ ate deficiency must have arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 to 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the emergence of ov@@ ag@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets are not in the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency and with sodium re@@ tention and cardi@@ ovas@@ cular clinical conditions only with caution .
as Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs above the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to slow@@ ing the neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ om@@ acet@@ ate is divor@@ ced in the breast milk , and for this reason it is contra@@ indicated by AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events had assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ re@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic ster@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tation optic , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , car@@ ot@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral ne@@ europ@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose joined a 5 @-@ month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms come with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which showed an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is an met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed active compound containing acid settlement with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
to be seen , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with the disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed for each gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the forecast for early mani@@ fold forms of the disease with the occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ated , and the disease carried on treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their st@@ ick@@ ed free anal@@ oga in the first year of life .
by ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen discharge ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ clu@@ sion of essential amino acids was it possible to increase survival rate newly diagnosed with post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) to increase diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and the first occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy was treated , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients with many on mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ine enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy ) , who were treated from a hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy and permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ clu@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versi@@ bly and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ dised to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism were obtained after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of her@@ o@@ glob@@ ular and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also investigated in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
following a oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablets , 15 minutes after intake of meas@@ ur@@ able plasma cent@@ ric concentrations were determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with urea cycl@@ ist or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting is not trace@@ able in plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were treated five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the extracted product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no cl@@ astic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who can still have no tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing ) or a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ chi@@ ves or a no@@ str@@ or .
according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and with an adult body weight and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium chloride , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat @-@ ups off before birth phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) were exposed , there came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of c@@ ort@@ ex .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ re@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic ster@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tation optic , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , car@@ ot@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral ne@@ europ@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
to be seen , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is similar to : phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for export@@ ation excess
based on surveys on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen can be produced .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versi@@ bly in the treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ develop@@ mental state can occur .
following a oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after intake of meas@@ ur@@ able plasma cent@@ ric concentrations were determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
with this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring sc@@ oop of 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must get the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare conditions , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they can accum@@ ulate the amount of protein in the body after the consumption of protein in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you can influence AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken if it is not prescri@@ ption drugs .
during the lac@@ tation , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may rise in breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , turbul@@ ence , head@@ aches , fl@@ avor@@ ing disorders , dis@@ grace of the hearing , des@@ ori@@ ity , memory problems and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ develop@@ mental states were observed .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in breast tip with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ do &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a higher dose and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients suffering from ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac attack to the heart and increase effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS at a sole gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patients often became a St@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
during the treatment of ACS An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift from G@@ PI , was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year as well as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PCI , angi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding when it was much more effective than Hep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients which may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be applied to patients who have recently had bleeding problems , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ovas@@ cular problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the committee for Human@@ ity P@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a removable substitute for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd by appo@@ inting An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ do in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) in case of emergency access or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intra@@ ven@@ ous pitch of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is carried out with the patient in a further result , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to be increased to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical trials , the reduced in@@ fusion dosage of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken up for 4 to 12 hours .
just before the procedure , a bolt rate of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an in@@ directly connec@@ tive intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value is shortened to less than 225 seconds ( ACT after 5 minutes ) , a second pitch of a weight of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constit@@ uted and di@@ lu@@ te medicines should be carefully taken before the application and rapidly taken into intra@@ ven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dosage is administered correctly .
in patients with medium severe kidney failure ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that are subjected to one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS ) or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second starting dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second starting dose to be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to approval in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , was the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose @-@ adjustment in an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ related patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intra@@ ven@@ ous he@@ ge@@ Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low @-@ molecular he@@ pat@@ itis .
• famous hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the substance or other ingredients or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood disorders due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial infection . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ bearing patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bleeding when it is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if existing PCI patients may occur in the most ble@@ edings of arter@@ ial points of the arter@@ ial spot , patients who undergo a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur throughout the treatment of principle everywhere .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be kept in order to ensure that the value after treatment of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine should be reached again before the treatment .
out@@ going from the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ bodies ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ Cy@@ ten@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase blood pressure .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected the upper th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or administered in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin in the regulation of glu@@ cose level ( sugar ) in the blood or can not process insulin .
insulin is very slightly different from human@@ ism , and the change means that it appears faster and a shorter period of action has a short @-@ term human@@ eness .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in the treatment in combination with type 1 diabetes , in which the body can produce no insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
for type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of substance gly@@ col hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how good blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first clinical study with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was diagnosed in comparison to a 0.14 % reduction in insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months , compared to 0.@@ 30 % for human normal .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients which may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to insulin or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ an@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glu@@ cose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH to provide approval for transporting A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the range of abdominal spreads .
because of reduced glu@@ ogen@@ esis capacities and the reduced insulin delivery , insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change in effect , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , is delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or production method can withdraw a change in insulin .
3 . an in@@ adequate dose or termination of treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ ent diabetes , can cause hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabet@@ ic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a non @-@ insulin delivery should be conducted under strict doctor &apos;s supervision and may make a change of the dosage necessary .
the time of emergence of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia depends on the mode profile of the used insulin and can therefore be changed when changing the treatment schem@@ as .
to increase the substances that increase blood sugar cane and strengthen the inc@@ lin@@ ation to hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ che@@ eses , include oral anti@@ diabet@@ ics , angi@@ ography @-@ Conver@@ ting @-@ Conver@@ ting ( Mao ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , rop@@ o@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide anti@@ biotics .
in addition , under the effect of men@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ ves the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ al counter @-@ regulation can be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies show no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ism in relation to pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin is neither in the breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ iti@@ ed after oral application .

severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cheese with in@@ som@@ nia can be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is treated by an in@@ tram@@ ous gift of glu@@ cose by a doctor .
following a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ onal injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary concern for severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glu@@ cose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin shots occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ ari@@ zation in the therapeutic ar@@ dos@@ ing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg has a proportional increase of glu@@ cose effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional rise of glu@@ cose levels .
insulin has a twice as fast active impact such as normal human@@ ization and achieves the complete glu@@ cose effect for approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ izing .
the data was clearly seen that during an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ al gl@@ aci@@ al control is achieved , as with human normal , 30 minutes before meal is given .
if is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was passed 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was given as with human normal view that was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ emic control is given as for human normal , which is 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves prior to meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin is given in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the beginning of the meal , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal , 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1B ) .
insulin is given 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1C ) .
