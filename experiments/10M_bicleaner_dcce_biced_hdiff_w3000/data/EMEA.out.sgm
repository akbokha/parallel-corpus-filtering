<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European public announcement report (EPAR), which explains how the committee is evaluated for Humanity's Humanity (CHMP) to get recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your disease or treatment, please read the packaging age (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melted tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to inhaling (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. vertebral thinking and speech, hallucinations (listening or sight of things that are not present), distrust and insane; • Bipolar disorder, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of an abnormal mood) alternating with periods of normal spirits.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe hormone episodes and to prevent Manical episodes in patients who have been addressed to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioral disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied to single or melt zenges in patients where the swallowing of tablets is processed into difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who simultaneously use other medicines the same as Abilify should be adjusted, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transmission between "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower dimensions as the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole carries on normalize the activity of brain, causing mental or manic symptoms to be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, to prevent resurgence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses that were involved in increased disturbance, over a period of two hours compared to a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was evaluated over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of abilify and placebo to reoccur on 160 patients where the manic symptoms had been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered an increased disrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the changes in patients suffering from a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who used to treatment were examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company has also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and absorbs the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies of injection solution included patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger decrease of symptoms increased disruptive than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term clinical symptoms effective as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented lastingly more effective as placebo the reoccur manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses are also effectively more effective than placebo the symptoms increased disruptive and were similar to lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients), acuity, blurred vision, drowsy (disation), drowsy, nausea (nausea), breath-hypersecretion (increased saliation), fatigue and exhaustion, orestlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanity Pants (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of abilippies in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who were mostly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes on the treatment of Aripiprazole were silent against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable to conceive the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission announced the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of heavy-heavy episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients that mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected, although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors are justidered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYPA4 inductor is set off in combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviours is one of psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of antipsychotic therapy, including Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic study showed that there was no risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder than Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocarnitinfarction, cardiovascular disease, conditions that apply for hypotonia or hypertension, treatment with haemorrhema) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskins: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with ABILIFY patients and symptoms of a late dyskinesis should occur, the dose should reduce or break the dose.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient developed signs and symptoms resulting in a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used in patients with crampires in the Anamnese or with conditions that are used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old in patients with psychosis that were associated with psychosis suffering from Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole a increased death of death in comparison to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relation between the dosage and response of unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases, extremely and associated with ketoazitin or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients that were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia related events at ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated with direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in regards to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as a side effect is known and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripiprazole can be used in combination with alcohol or other centralized drugs as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric-acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not relevant as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased AUC by Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosilreductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 "bad '(= Poor") Metabolisieres can result in high-effective Inhibitors of CYPA4 in higher plasma concentrations in higher plasma samples compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one draws the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYPA4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should weigh the potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteases, should have similar effects and therefore a similar dose of Dosage should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level before the front of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered jointly with an even increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolic of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3 methodology of morphine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeetzol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">People should be advised to inform their doctor if you are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "due to inadequate data to safety during the human being and due to the reproduction of the animal, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the possible use justifies the potential risk for the fetus." ""</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned, hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, to use, until they are safe that Aripiprazole on it has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) referred to as under Placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripiansonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was treated in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manical episodes at Bipolar-I disorder - in a controlled study above 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study above 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term phase, over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo among which significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters were found, yielded no medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of Cpk (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripianoma in comparison to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects, which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and above their occurrence in treating Aripiprazole, adverse dyskinetry and varicfancies, adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate acute excess of Aripiprazole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death row.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the efficacy of a tick in the treatment of an overdose associated with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that haemalysis is an overdose of use because Aripiprazole has a high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought to describe the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a participantagonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for the alpha-1-adrenches and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition of Aripipylbenzene in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg. a dose-dependent reduction in bonds of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor-lign, at Nucleus caudatus and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrenia showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms compared to placebo compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-stage-controlled study, 52 of the percentage of responding patients who contributed to study medication remained similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured data, which were defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depression Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement as at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia a significantly higher reduction in remembranes, which was 34% in the Aripianoma Group, and 57% in placebo was found.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study conducted in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients received a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca. 5%).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy of placebo over 3 weeks versus placebo.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled Monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with either a lack of psychotic mercury, Aripiprazole showed a corresponding effectiveness in week 3 and a vigorous effect, comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition Aripiprazole also showed a comparable part of patients suffering from symptomatic remission of the mania to such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with either a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar disease, with or without mental health, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole was diagnosed with superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to Monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over a period of 26 weeks followed by Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before Randomization a remission, showed themselves in regard to the prevention of a bipolar decline, predominantly in prevention of prevention.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP6 and CYP2D6 enzyme responsible for dehydration and hydroxyylation of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkyelling is catalyzes by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination time of approximately 75 hours for Aripibezole is about CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= Poor ') metabolic antennas using CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripirazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic study schizophrenic patients no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics has no clue on clinically significant differences in ethroethics or the effect of smoking in Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripibezole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study at subjects with varied liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to attract mud to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies for security resin, toxicity in repeated, reproduction, genotoxicity and canogens, the preclinical data could not recognize particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed merely in dosages or expositions that have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects recalled a dossient-dependent adverse drug accumulation (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold the middle Steady state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelithios was diagnosed as a result of the precipitation of sulfate of sulphate monolithic treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations were found in the human Galle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of concentrations found in the sulphate-conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole not more than 6% of the concentrations in the study, and are far below limit values (6%) in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages of 3- and 11x of the middle Steady State AUC in the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="637">Clinical effectiveness in men In the HORIZON-RFT-study were randomized 508 men, and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical factions was 7.5% at Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% on placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">Another study in males (study CZOL446M2308) was once an annual administration of Aclasta compared to a weekly gift from alendronat to the percentage change of Lendenwirl-BMD compared to 24 months in comparison to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of treatment at Morbus Paget the bone Aclasta was studied in people and patients at age 30 years with radiologically proven, especially easy to deal with severe Morbus Paget of the bone (medium serum mirror of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronacid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of craedronat once daily during 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain impact was observed in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responsibilities under the end of the six-month study (on the therapy) were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">The therapeutic approach was observed from the 143 with Aclasta and 107 with risedronat, compared to 71 the patients treated with Risedronat, compared with 71 who were treated with craedronat in a mean duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledric acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma beeps quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase of low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the peak.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biennial disappearance from the big cycle with half-life cycle t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ years 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period of ½ litres 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution stages (α and β, with the above ½ -values) represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16% of the administered dose of urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The whole body-Clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of Zoledronacid concentrations by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma centric at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance of Cytochrome P450-Enzymic acid is unlikely to metabolized because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, material-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledric acid correlated with the creatinine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinine-Clearance, and in the 64 studied patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This gives that a slight (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function, down to a creatine-Clearance up to 35 ml / min, no dose adjustment of the Zoledric acid requires.</seg>
<seg id="655">There are only constrained data for severe kidney function (Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), this population is not possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC) were given 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutical exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was administered in rats, administered by 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the age of 2-3 weeks (a cumulative dose that corresponds to AUC, equivalent to AUC, corresponds to AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated treatment, the maximum human exposure was exceeded, toxicological effects on other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common report in studies with repeated application was an increased primary sponsor in the metaphyse of the long bone in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a report that reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, one observed a teratogenicity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as an external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was embossed in 0.1 mg / kg due to a serious serum-calcium mirror.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (in particular overweighting patients) in which metformin (a diabetesmedication) is not shown. • It can be used together with another type of diabetes (artherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (in particular overweighed patients), the metformin can not be satisfactory in the highest tolerated dose alone.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfa drugs or insulin, the existing dose of sulfa drugs can be retained, except for patients with hypoglyleukemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfa drugs or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better utilized and decreases blood sugar levels, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients the activity of acetone in tripletherapy were examined; the patients received a combination of metformin with sulfa drugs, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the study the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glycol hemoglobin, HbA1c), which indicates how good blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value which states that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study the impact of the additional contribution of acetformin and sulfa drugs showed up by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo carried a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin, a lowering of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% to those patients who took placebo additionally.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual acuity, infections of upper respiratory tract infection, weight gain and hypothesis (reduced sensitivity to maturing).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can not be applied to patients or potentially allergic (allergic) to pioglitazon or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency and diabetic ketoaziz (high acid level - acidspar - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided to implement Actos in the framework of a monotherapy (in the single use) as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients, metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission proposed Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited granted an approval to enter Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white and whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "ACTOS." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and insuitable for metformations due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">There are no data available for use in patients under 18 years of age, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attacks or symptomatic coronary heart failure), the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest possible dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or eclome, especially those with reduced kardial reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and eclome, when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcomes study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced painrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports about heart failure occurred, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality.</seg>
<seg id="771">Patients with increased output gap (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm) or other signs of liver disease may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range, the metastases will soon be able to check again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms develop, identify with a hepatitis, such as unclear nausea, vomiting, harmonizing pain, fatigue, appetite and / or dark harn, are to check the liver values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone is continued, should be directed to the laboratory parameters of clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">Clinical trials with Pioglitazon has been demonstrated a dosages of weight gain, which may stir in fat deposits and in some cases with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hailing from the therapy with Pioglitazon, a minor reduction in the middle hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.8%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 3.6-4% and the hematocrits by 1-2% and the hematology (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-insensity, Pioglitazon is a oral and triple combination therapy with sulfa drugs or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a doscope independent hypoglykemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment with thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, was reported on an occurrence or deterioration of diabetic maculaöp with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">"" "" "" "it is unclear if there are direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaödemen should be aware of the possibility of a macular aract, when patient report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered." ""</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone breeding, randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated structure of fractures was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years, with Pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women that were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years to study cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazon treated with Pioglitazon treated patients with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractions per 100 patients) in patients that were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if one patient wishes a pregnancy or an adult, the treatment is absent (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies in investigation of interaction effects have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with pharmaceuticals to metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, Cyclosporine, calcium-blocker and HMGCoA-reductins are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with the anterior chamber (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC of Pioglitazon about 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-Intor) resulted in a lowering of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is the result that under treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistence in the pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the killing growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the Turgor and the refraction of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-Anstiege performed on the threefold threshold of the norm range frequently as under Placebo, but more rarely than in comparisons-groups under metformin or sulfa drugs.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than under Placebo if Pioglitazon or her.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, seldom about heart failure in Pioglitazone has been reported, more frequently if Pioglitazon has been used in combination with insulin or patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone breeding are randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7.400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years-running PROACTIVE study, fractures were treated with Pioglitazon treated patients with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the maximum recommended dose of 120 mg / day over four days, after 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator and Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which leads to an increased insulin model of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increase peripheral glucosms in the event of insulin-resistence.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus glicited as monotherapy has been carried out over two years to study the time until descend of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained due to Pioglitazon at 69% of patients (compared to 50% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient for insulin, were randomised to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients below Pioglitazon, the medium HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to those patients who continue to receive insulin; a reduction of the insulin dose associated with Pioglitazon treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinine Quotients showed a statistically significant decrease in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week examination to type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction in the plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol and minor, however, clinically significant increased LDL- cholesterol is observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasia glycaine and the free fatty acids in comparison to placebo and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo under Pioglitazon, no statistically significant increase of LDL cholesterol was observed, while under the metformin and licited values, values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober-triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this also has an effect on the triglyceride absorption, as well as to the fleece triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized to either a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is absorbed quickly, with top concentration of Pioglitazone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocou- and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with mmonary (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-Inctor) and lowers the plasma centric of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive labelled pioglitazon in humans the marker was found mainly in the subjects (55%) and found a lower degree in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination time of immutable Pioglitazon amounts to 5-6 hours, and those of the entire active metabolites is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centric of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function, but the rates of oral Clearance of mother substances are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys coincide in accordance with the repeated agreement plasma volume magnification with haemesis, anemia, and reversible electrolyphie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the result that under treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistency of the parent, which reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the killing growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) were induced in male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family-omatporous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidindices led to an increased incidence of colloquium.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated structure of fractures was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years, with Pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women that were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years to study cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazon treated with Pioglitazon treated patients with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractions per 100 patients) in patients that were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years the effects of combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazon or Glicensic were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decline of the Albumin / Kreatinine Quotients showed a statistically significant decrease in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober-triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this is both of a effect on the lacriglycaeride absorption, as well as to the hepatical Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing in terms of their primary endpoints, a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly myocardial infarction, strokes, acute Revascular and Revascularisation of the leg arteries that are close to taking Pioglitazon no cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Inflammation reactions, such as Ösophagitis, malophageal Ulzera and malophageal erosion, seldom followed by malophageal strokes, were used in patients under the intake of alendronat (some were severe and required a hospital.)</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore point out attentive to all signs and symptoms which are to be pointed out on possible malophageal irritation as dysphagia, pain at swallowing or retrospinal pain, or disguile the medicine and get medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe malophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that take on a malophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing assignments are passed to patients and to be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">During large clinical trials with altendronat, there was no increased risk associated with altendron, were rare (after market launch) Magen- and Duodenalulcera, including some severe and severe complications, reported (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the treated doctor is important for therapy planning on each patient basis of an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to take the pill to the dose of a dose of ADROVANCE to take the tablet to the next morning after confirming their expatriation.</seg>
<seg id="1300">They should not take two tablets at the same day, but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the given day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other illnesses that affect the mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism), should also be treated before the beginning of the therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronat foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplement, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendronat when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after intake of alendronat before taking other medicines (see section 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not performed, alendronat was taken in clinical trials together with a multitude of usually prescribed drugs, without being clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore neither while the pregnancy is still used by pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronat leave no indication to directly harm the effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteopathy was reported in patients suffering from bisphosphonians; most of the reports originate from cancer patients, however, was also reported in osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, the serum of serum calciums were up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and the serum phosphates up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hypocramps, caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nose-muginal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers over 12 years the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be consumed completely with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible, and once the symptoms occur, especially the swelling of the nose-mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be impeeled down on the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the severity of the severity of the hypocrite symptoms that were reported by the patient before the start of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried their symptoms all 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Symptoms of hypocrabs symptoms except the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the Aerinaze's income, over a decrease of symptoms by 46,0%, compared with 35,9% in patients who kills Pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, the patients suffering from Aerinaze showed a relief of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinikaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachykarmic (heart hunt), pharyngxie, dilution, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (drowsiness), somnolence, insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients that might be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against adrenal agents or loratadin (another medicine to treat allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should also not be used in patients that suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), heart or vascular diseases (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hypertension), or have a haemorrhagic stroke (caused by a hemorrhage) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe company to permit a permit for the transport of Aerinaze on the EU's entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is in whole to swallow (i.e. excluding them to crush or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used due to the faults of data for immunity and efficacy (see Section 5.1) not for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue with symptoms of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, because during long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can be taken with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the reduction in swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients that are treated with a monoaminase (Mao) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity of combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconjectors such as brooidolamine, pervasergotamine or other deconcamine, phenylepanol, ephedrine, ephedrine, ephedrazoline, naphazoline etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collection and the data is not enough to discuss appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinikaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function. the data is not enough to discuss appropriate recommendations.</seg>

<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine agonistic effectiveness of Aerinikaze tablets were determined from the total amount for the symptomatic (except nasal muginal swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine about the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinikaze tablets in view to the swelling effect, determines using the nose-muginal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender, age, or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is traceable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of Aerinaze on healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxyz loratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-doscope study, which was conducted with formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects, were noted that four subjects desloratadin were badly modified.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component-interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine according to the sole gift of pseudoephedrine was equivalent to exposure to a aerobic tablet tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies for safety, toxicity, for recurritive gift, to Genotoxicity and for reproduoxicity, however, preclinical data with Desloratadin can't recognize particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-stoic studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was in the oral administration to rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of addling, airment of sleep and performance in days) before and after 6 weeks of treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to capture and melt the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergy rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius were considered an average decrease in the symptom (symptom points) by 25 to 26%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtikaria, the decrease of the symptom climbed to six weeks treatment with aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients which may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, loratadin or one of the other ingredients.</seg>

<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, aperius was effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, nose-secretion and itching of nose, itching and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis in dependence of the duration of symptoms can also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the total amount of profile for life quality at Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the intestinal caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was also investigated, as the underlying pathophysiology, as the underlying pathophysiology, is similar to the pathology in the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a causal factor in all ancient idiopathic uralism is expected that Desloratadin is carried out in other forms of the Urtikaria in other forms of the Urtikaria: this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic Urtikaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of puritus and the number of paddles at the end of the first dose of dosages.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine in chronic idiopathic Urtikaria the minority of the patients who did not react to Antihistamine faced by the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of itching by more than 50% was observed at 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as was measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate this variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients "demos were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, was achieved in 4% of patients a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant Kumulation after a daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, this enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of desloratadin enzyme, so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo non CYPA4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single doscope study with desloratadine in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fat-fat, low-calorie breakfast) does not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical studies involved with desloratadin and Loratadin showed a comparable degree of exposure from Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences in regards the toxicity of desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies for safety, toxicity in repeated gift, genotoxicity and reproduction of reproduction can detect the preclinical data with desloratadin no specific dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin can extrapolarise in adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple sockets of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine in a dosage of up to 20 mg. a day was applied daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study on adults and juveniles, in the desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of clinical dose) has been applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc interval showed.</seg>

<seg id="1781">With adult and youngsters of allergic rhinitis, aperius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, nose-secretion and itching of nose, itching and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown by the total amount of profile for life quality at Rhino-Sttivitis, Aerius tablets deteriorate effectively the seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic Urtikaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of puritus and the number of paddles at the end of the first dose of dosages.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted metabolic phenotyps was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study on children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, metabolized metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 to 6 hours higher and the Cmax is about 3 to 4times higher with a terminal half-time of about 120 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine which should cause a trunk of influenza that could cause a future pandemic to protect.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic emerges from a new strain of Grippevirus, who can easily spread from person to human, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the parts of the influenza virus as a "body-foreign" and is antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in the position to make contact with a Grippevirus this master's quicker antibodies.</seg>

<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drug, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, which had previously been treated with Protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It was compared with low-dosed Ritonavir enhanced medicine AGenerase was compared with 206 adults who had previously been protease inhibitor with other protease.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in blood (viral load) or the alteration of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitor had had more patients a viral load below 400 copies / ml than under placebo but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children who had been treated with Protease Inhibitors, only very few to their treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated early with Protease inhibitor, this treatment with Ritonavir reinforced medicines Ageneric drugs are as effective as other protease inhibitor:</seg>

<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aggravating in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteins were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Vase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the faults of data for immunity and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily with severe liver function at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use is to be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver function with care, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">AGenerase may not be given simultaneously with drugs, which have a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzry 3A4 (CYPA4).</seg>

<seg id="2052">Amonavir is available from the solution 14% less bivouacs as of the capsules; therefore Agenerase solution and aggregate capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low in the elimination of amoncavir and Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for the treatment of patients with a Mucysaccharitin I (MPS I; α-L-Iduronidase deficiency), in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycoaminoglykane, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements complicate, reduced lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment of aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor, which has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured in terms of reducing Gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years old Aldurazyme was reduced the Gag concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children enrolled in the study showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, pains, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Frequent side effects in patients below five years have increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachykarmic (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may cause patients that may react very sensitive to laronidase or any other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update every year all new information that may be announced, examine and check this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of aldurazyme is given to patients who observe aldurazyme as regards reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the Company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for transporting aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indexed to long-term enzyme (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor, which has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient tolerates it every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and no dosing scheme is recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and no dosing scheme is recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any infusion which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored continuously, and the infusion of aldurazyme should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical environment, where restoring equipment for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients IgG-antibodies fought against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution (see section 4.3, 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Having a little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk reaction, must be cautious after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamine and / or antipyreka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a mild or moderate-duty infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is to be considered and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half the infusion rate, in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are to decline, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is to be sawn.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be entered with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, where the reaction is occurred again.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procain, because a potential risk of interference with intracellular intake of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Unexperimental studies allow not to direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that were exponated over breast milk, it is recommended to not satisfy during treatment with aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the period of 5 years or older in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5, are very common (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory system and lungs, they also occurred heavy reactions, including bronchospasm, breathability and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Kids Unwanted drug effects in relation to aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at age 5, with predominantly severe expiration and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most cases, within 3 months after the treatment of a sermon version, it mostly occurred within one month (on average after 26 days, compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature departure from the study), in 13 / 45 patients no antibody assessments were shown, among them 3 patients, among which it never came to sermon version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low-cancer levels demonstrated a robust decrease in the Gag mirror in Harn while in patients with high antibody titres to be a variable reduction of gag at Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed marginal to low neutralising currency effects in vitro, which seemed to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reducing Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Antibodies of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically fell along with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning for the hydrolysis of accumulated substrates and the prevention of further accumulation provides sufficient recovery of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion Laronidase becomes quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Lysosomes, most likely via Manni-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme were randomized in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to study the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients from the Middle phenotype and only one patient proved the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an investigational expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the total distance in 6-minute walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received approximately 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg of aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with aldurazyme were given an improvement in the lung function and the ability to improve in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open renewal study there was an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in deregazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme Group, as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is not significant over this period of clinically and absolute pulmonary volume continued to be proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatoma, 22 (85%) of the study reached normal metastases until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks there was a significant drop in the Gag mirrors in the Harn (µg / mg of creatinine), which remained constant at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous clinical manifestation between patients that were taken into account by using a combined end point, the clinically significant changes in five patients (58%), was generally observed in 10 patients (22%), and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was performed, mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of 20 patients was investigated, at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with severe insulating form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirrors at the Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 e / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined after the mean age of the younger patients with the moderate infeed form, whereas the elderly patients with severe losses were limited, limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of different aldurazyme dosing schemata performed on the Gag mirrors in the harn, liver volume and the 6-minute auditory test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be used in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, an advertised alternative; however, is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will assess any new information that will be published annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug are updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at age 5 was similar to those in older and less strongly affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to incompetence and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Clinical trials were no longer necessary in patients with a creatinine Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, who recommended Dosage adaptations to all patients recommended Dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data in patients with a creatinine Clearance of under 45 ml / min was not enough; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and impose with pharmacological effects of the drug, as absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects, which were noted after the launch of orlistat, is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety linked to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days of normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of orlistat reported cases reported by orlistat-overdosing, either side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human beings and animal experiments can be attributed to a quick regression of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the lipassive properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by kovalente to the active serin-rest of the gastric and pancreatic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived that 60 mg orbit, taken three times a day, the absorption of about 25% of the food fat is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 affect the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat times daily in combination with a hypokaloral, greasy food.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemical therapy, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), which are the trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, dioxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by an additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because the effects in this age group are not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Alxi was investigated in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapists, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy with chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi, were no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy with chemotherapy and vomiting for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron. (127 von 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">Compared to Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company in Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the transport of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancerous disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderation cancer due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding one prior to the chemotherapy-given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the thicket of collefacts, patients with anamnesty observing or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection can be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable at the same gift from Palonosetron with pharmaceuticals to prolong the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or that lead to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy with another chemotherapeutics-gift, Aloxi is not used for prevention of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, dioxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interactions occurred between a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">A significant impact of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Doxorubicin) and CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Doxorubicin, fluoroperix, paroxetine, latoxetur, sertralin and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on applying Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not necessary, so Palonosetron should not be used when pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common for a dose of 250 micrograms of observed effects (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and stipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reaction and reactions at the administration location (burning, curing, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar amounts of unwanted events such as in other dosievisions were observed; there were no dose action relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, however, due to the great distribution volume, dialysis is probably no effective therapy for an alxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1.132 patients were obtained with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 (half-time) or 100 mg of ondansetron (half-time) received, which was given an intravenous day 1 without examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients were obtained with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, with patients compared to the 32 mg of Ondansetron, given an intravenous day at day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies involving ocaletogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summed up in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the intracellular de- and reolarisation of the Ionenkanel ventricularization and extend the duration of action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was given to evaluate the ECG effects of I.V. in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption after intravenous gift arises on an initial decrease in the plasma concentration of a slow elimination from the body with an average set time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the whole dose range from 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in a healthy and cancer dossient dossiproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans was measured in 11 hodenial patients between day 1 and day 5 measured by the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, it emerges from once daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron on 3 consecutive days, full exposure of 0.75 mg measured, but was the Cmax after the one-time tax of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% of the kidneys will be eliminated and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolic rate compared to Palonosetron in less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolic have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lower dimensions, the Isoaks CYPA4 and CYP1A2 have been involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours of the urine, Palonosetron as an immutable agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single-time PCR-injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function problems the terminale eliminationshale and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In previous studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposition which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 According to clinical trials, Palonosetron can only accumulate in very high concentrations of ion channels that can also be involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose) was given in about the 30x of the therapeutic exposure of the human liver, led to an increased frequency of liver tumor, endokralline neoplasmen (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, annierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully familiar, but because of the used high doses and since Aloxi is intended for unique use, the relevance of these results will be low evaluated.</seg>

<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been demonstrably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo is not effective against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not speak after two to three days of treatment, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>

<seg id="2678">The primary indices of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was canceled at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">For the treatment of infected skin irritated Altargo and Cefalexin similar response: when the results of both studies were taken in skin care, about 90% of patients were treated to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, that Altargo was observed in the treatment of abszessen (oidated cavities in the body tissue) or from infections that have been demonstrably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Humanitarian Internal Affairs (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections overweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirations, depreciation or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for transport of Altargo on the EU's entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients with which no improvement is shown within two to three days should be investigated once again and considered an alternative therapy in consideration (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensibility or serious local irritation through the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is canceled to carefully constrain the ointment and to have an adequate alternative therapy of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of pidromutiline, a substance that is insulated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action from Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosoms, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interacts antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the tendering branch of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptide-transferaseCentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By ties to this bond, Pleuromutiline inhibit the peptidyltransportation, partially P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of Retapamulin at least some infection processes should appear, an advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of a non-response to the treatment of S.aureus the presence of trunks with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>

<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used within a frame of two doses of existing vaccination, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix is only used when Immunization exists a low risk of hepatitis B infection, which can be taken out of two doses of existing vaccination.</seg>

<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccinated vaccination since 1996 and has been registered under the vaccination of a vaccination since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same illnesses, however, Twinrix Adults and Twinrix children are given in a frame of three doses of existing vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix package include identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix Adults are also used as proof for the Ambirix application.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentric in one month after the final injections.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month period and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted a month after the last injection for Hepatitis A and B in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that at the Ambirix degree, the degree of protection was similar in a six-month distance between injection.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side-effects from Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection, redness, mats (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix is allowed to react to the active agents (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines, which reported over severe side effects during the 2-doses of vaccines using the Ambirix, or during the 3-doses of inactive hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B- surface antigen, was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, performed at vaccines at age between 1 and including 15 years, sermon rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were administered one month after the first dose and 100% of a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (d. h in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2768">The immune response to both antigens was comparable to both antigens, which according to vaccination of 3 cans with a combination-simulated hepatisitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dosed volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are comparable to immunization in 0-6 months, vaccination is to be found in the 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on data that have been announced since issuance of the first official approval, CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was released in circulation (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited because of small patients.</seg>

<seg id="2808">Ammonyaps - split up to several single doses at meals - slured, mixed with food or through a gastrostomichives (through the abdominal wall in the stomach-leading hose) or a nostration (by the nose into the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparative study, since ammonyliquor could not be compared with other treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonyliquor can also lead to loss of appetite, depression, irritation, headache, impotence, fluid retention, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Humanity Pants (CHMP) came to the conclusion that ammonium in patients with the disturbances of the urea cycle was effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonyliquor has been under "exceptional circumstances" as due to the condition of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The commitment is indicated in all patients where a complete Enzymmangel has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-shaped form (incomplete Enzymatic, which manifested after the first life of life) there is an indication for use when in the Anamnese is a hyperglycemic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, considering the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose dium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and with an adult body weight and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citruline or arginine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a Argininosuccinate deficiency must have arginine in a dosage of 0.4 to 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk of the emergence of ovagophagulcera when the tablets are not in the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney insufficiency and with sodium retention and cardiovascular clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As Metabolization and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat occurs above the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate in young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to slowing the neuronal proliferation and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found if phenylacomacetate is divorced in the breast milk, and for this reason it is contraindicated by AMMONAPS during the breastfeeding time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events had assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic stercephalopathy in connection with lactation optic, heavy hypokalemia, carottopenie, peripheral neeuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose joined a 5-month old toddler with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms come with the accumulation of phenylacate, which showed an intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacate is an metabolized active compound containing acid settlement with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">To be seen, phenylacetylglutamine with urea is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with the disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed for each gram of sodium polyphenylbutyrate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast for early manifold forms of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infated, and the disease carried on treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with their sticked free analoga in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By haemalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen discharge (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacate), proteinclusion of essential amino acids was it possible to increase survival rate newly diagnosed with postpartal (however, within the first month of life) to increase diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and the first occurrence of hyperammonium encephalopathy was treated, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients with many on mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygine encephalopathy), who were treated from a hypertrophic encephalopathy and permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a proteincluated diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversibly and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidised to phenylacate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism were obtained after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with liver cirrhosis of heroglobular and with liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also investigated in cancer patients after intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Following a oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablets, 15 minutes after intake of measurable plasma centric concentrations were determined by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cyclist or hemoglobinopathies, after different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), the next morning after nocturnal fasting is not traceable in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses) were treated five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medicine is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the extracted product Phenylacetylglutamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus testing, sodium phenylbutyrat had no clastic effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is either taken orally (babies and children who can still have no tablets, or patients with swallowing) or a gastrostomichives or a nostror.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose dium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and with an adult body weight and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citruline or arginine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium chloride, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat-ups off before birth phenylacate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat) were exposed, there came to lesions in the pyramid of cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic stercephalopathy in connection with lactation optic, heavy hypokalemia, carottopenie, peripheral neeuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">To be seen, phenylacetylglutamine is similar to: phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for exportation excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on surveys on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, sodium polyphenylbutyrate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversibly in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurodevelopmental state can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">Following a oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, 15 minutes after intake of measurable plasma centric concentrations were determined by phenylbutyrat.</seg>

<seg id="2881">This can help in patients suffering from angina or cardiac attack to the heart and increase effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS at a sole gift or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIA inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patients often became a Stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a closure) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>

<seg id="2972">In the first clinical study with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7,60% to 7.46%) was diagnosed in comparison to a 0.14% reduction in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months, compared to 0.30% for human normal.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients which may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglyanemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to provide approval for transporting Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, to apply or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the range of abdominal spreads.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of reduced gluogenesis capacities and the reduced insulin delivery, insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in effect, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, is delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or production method can withdraw a change in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3. an inadequate dose or termination of treatment, in particular in patients with an insulent diabetes, can cause hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazide; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a non-insulin delivery should be conducted under strict doctor's supervision and may make a change of the dosage necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of emergence of a hypoglykemia depends on the mode profile of the used insulin and can therefore be changed when changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To increase the substances that increase blood sugar cane and strengthen the inclination to hypoglycheeses, include oral antidiabetics, angiography-Converting-Converting (Mao) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, propoxyphs, ropoylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of menatholytics such as Betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserves the symptoms of adrenal counter-regulation can be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies show no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humanism in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if isinglulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin is neither in the breast milk, nor is it resoritied after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are listed below are listed from clinical trials, grouped according to system organs and administered after decreasing frequency of their emergence (very common: ≥ 1 / 10; common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; it is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold, Welfare, cool and slow skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, distortion problems, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lierystrophy Will be missed to continuously change the injection valve within injection valve, may result in the result of a Lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycheese with insomnia can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is treated by an intramous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Following a glucoagonal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary concern for severe hypoglykemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin shots occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu- manem normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, isinglularization in the therapeutic ardosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg has a proportional increase of glucose effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional rise of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin has a twice as fast active impact such as normal humanization and achieves the complete glucose effect for approximately 2 hours earlier than humanizing.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was clearly seen that during an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postpranal glacial control is achieved, as with human normal, 30 minutes before meal is given.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If isinglulisin was passed 2 minutes before meal, a better postpranal control was given as with human normal view that was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is given as for human normal, which is 2 Mi- grooves prior to meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin is given in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal was given (figure 1A) and compared to human normal, 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin is given 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
