package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; conv@@ ection ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by this easier access .
further information about using &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Connectivity ; .
to load these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings enh@@ ancements , open the card tool@@ box and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard settings from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; set before you comp@@ ile this package .
in order to use the crash module , click on &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the site that has brought down &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of crash when present , delete .
the module &apos;s module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with ex@@ tras view filters . with the module you can filter &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; it can filter our work directory in different ways .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree to view ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the just displayed web page . by default , the display with the root node of document , example : document@@ Element , all other no@@ des are elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text messages to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; fs@@ view ; found in sh@@ ed@@ ing@@ arch@@ s with the help of a so @-@ called tree @-@ map graphic image . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the sum of size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of size of the entries is specified . so , large files can be easily detected if they can be seen far below in the file &apos;s hier@@ archy . so , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphic and interactive version of the UNIX &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap account represents a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched by color mode , can either be depth for easy detection of sh@@ ading depth or the picture of another file member such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various features of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify if sufficient space is available at all , or if sufficient space is displayed by the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . in addition , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle .
in display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ ap should generally be kept , that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view ; this target will not always be stopped . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle is quad@@ ratic .
how to split the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left . it is always beneficial to the areas such as rec@@ tan@@ gles that rec@@ tan@@ gles ; the best methods are to be square . the best methods of this case are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive role .
you can specify the minimum set for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a report pattern is drawn in the area of the superior entry , to indicate that this area is actually assigned by an or@@ derly entry .
originally , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , it was designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

a simple to use camera interfaces will be available to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ al introduced ; contains a quick image processing with basic training tools . you can use these to evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily extended using K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins ( Hand@@ book ) modules .
though &amp; digi@@ plug got ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G export and ICC paint vulner@@ able workflow .
improved database with considerably more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or the lens , can be sought .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end user . therefore , you should have problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ al ; tried to make any problems or improvements for them as easy as possible for them . if you are using this link , your web browser doesn &apos;t open a page in error report . all necessary information may be registered here . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ al ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you want to answer a regular users of &amp; digi@@ al , we will have questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ ous ; but in this mailing list , English people will be spoken , but you should be aware of this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ al page ; homepage to learn news about excep@@ ted versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ al ;
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ al ; is the registration in the developer mailing list . guidance for announ@@ cements in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ plug , you &apos;ll be asked where to specify your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folders . simply enter the folder icon in order to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add a lot of folders like you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ al ; you &apos;ll also use the digi@@ BO@@ D settings .
if you already have a photo collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as the base file . no image is changed in this folder . no image will be changed . during search of the folder you will see a progress indicator as this :
&amp; digi@@ al : thir@@ sty the library sp@@ lash in its full depth . you can &apos;t lock sub@@ folder , unless it run@@ ways in a hidden folder , so you can insert an item in hidden folder . this can be placed at an item in front of the sign@@ post .
if you take an existing folder with photos as the base file , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list may have no photos as symbols . you can change the album by using any any Photo Album . this will then be used as a Alb@@ um@@ icon . further details will be found in the albums .
once you have configured the base file , you can set up your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use my albums and my st@@ ills to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ e@@ support : if you use the raw mode of your camera so it can handle it ; possibly , support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported cass@@ ette cameras in the help of raw material support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
a simple to use camera interfaces will be available to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will also be used as a disk drive . the camera will also be used as a disk drive . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ b@@ 2 ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera lenses . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also a free , further distribution protocol for digital cameras , a widely distributed protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial line for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ plug . supports this cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the thumb@@ nails could not be read from some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support could not be done in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF can &apos;t be used , or the creation might be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ ous is how easy it can expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I Mod@@ ules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ al ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ vi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the target is to provide modules for all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it is also a user . your advantage is that it is much easier to complement a function as to complement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ al came out .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
pulling and removing images everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another application window . the only limitation is the picture not in keywords , date list or searching .
- a file selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently being displayed in the symbol view . so the fil@@ tering on the fil@@ ename is only displayed if this man will display the symbol view . which fields are displayed in the dialog of Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; presents an organized view on your photo albums . these albums can be stored in a single album , where they are created on the disk , sorted by the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks or after the date on which the album was created first , the date may be modified in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly in an album . select the album Import Pictures . you can also add a screen shot directly to an album . select the album Import Photos .

the Alb@@ um@@ - date : will be used when you sort of albums by date and sort of albums by date .
the buttons oldest , average , latest : this set the date on the one of the oldest , the latest picture , or the average of the album . at first , the average of the pictures will be calculated from their EX@@ IF data . if this fails , the date of last change of each file will be used in this folder instead .
when you first came to an album in &amp; digi@@ al , the first picture will be displayed as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; my Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first picture of the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right button of the mouse and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; as Alb@@ um@@ af@@ schau beer ; in addition , you can put the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in one collection and collections cannot be sealed .
&amp; digi@@ al ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keywords . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will display you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fiers in the tool bar .
when you &apos;re recording an album the first time you need to wait while the thumb@@ nails are generated , and you can avoid using the images in the Tools menu .

you should note that it can come to problems with other image processing programs with the content included in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image , such as orientation , bl@@ ending , etc .
&amp; Go ; introduces two options for rotation . the sim@@ pl@@ est is to click on the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , you can click the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo of &amp; digi@@ al ; deleted , it will be post@@ pon@@ ed in the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; F8 picture del@@ eting or dis@@ f if you would rather be del@@ eting , you can use it by using Shift ; Ent@@ f .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ al ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the screen view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below to view only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords will provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catal@@ og@@ ze . tags are st@@ ic@@ kers , which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword is assigned , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all photos with this keyword will be marked .
tags can be sorted in a hier@@ arch@@ ical tree . you can also organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My st@@ ature , so you can search , easily find .
the keyword will be stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your key in other programs . in addition , the keywords are imported during loss of database re @-@ imported , once &amp; digi@@ ous ; the pictures notice .
you can add new tags by clicking with the right button of the mouse either on &amp; quot ; My keywords ; or click on an existing keyword and then click on an existing keyword if you have clicked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be given to the keyword .

Neb@@ ula &apos;s search box is a small lamp in green when the search takes place . if you click here the fil@@ tering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ul@@ ars . if you can open this search , see a simple search box as described above . you can have entered this search here as a live search , which is always fil@@ tering out what you have saved as a search crit@@ eri@@ on . after you have saved this file into the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK and the search will be executed in the view My search list in the main window . if you want to change your search for a name in My search list , you just have to select the corresponding entry in My search list and select a option in his context menu .

if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search .
the Extended search shows you an extended search form with many options available , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ous ; s database can be found .
the list of search rules is used to add the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ at@@ enb@@ ank . any option can be added by operators . each option can be added with others via the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... can also create search of type &amp; quot ; AND N@@ ICH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; SU@@ PER ; characterized by a long number of a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare these sign@@ atures . depending on the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more you meet . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop every picture . by means of a sw@@ elling , the results can be enlarged or resi@@ zed . if you slide a picture of somewhere above the symbol of the exact search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can let it drop .
sk@@ etch : open @-@ hand color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and digi@@ plug . find the matching pictures . also , a sw@@ elling value can be set .
this rider puts an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to extract a square . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally uses the images of your imag@@ ery Ge@@ o data .
in the bottom of the bottom , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ Fol@@ der .
&amp; digi@@ al ; introduces a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported video file formats , also raw files , together .
choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L To be added to the light@@ box and its windows open . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ous window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ ous screen with L Extras .
from the thumb@@ nail , you can drag the images you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and place there . if you do preview sync from the tool@@ bar and carry out shi@@ fts on one of the images , then they will compare the same range of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to locate quickly from a picture series , then use the left mouse button on any given picture , in order to view it in the left side . on the right , the left mouse will appear in the right area . this simpli@@ fies through a range of similar images .
of course , normal del@@ etes are also working directly from the table like F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the top side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each range you will find a built @-@ in swivel function , which you can swivel to the crossed arrows . in order to swi@@ v@@ ise the visible range of the image , you have to hold this and the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the same mode , both pictures will show the same picture range .
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom kno@@ b under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse into the picture and out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital inventory management - exec@@ utable every part of the process after the image is taken after the final issue and the permanent memory . each of the photos stores , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory . but most of us do not make this in systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how you can back , protect and use images again . we will consider downloading , ren@@ aming , convert , group@@ ing , backup , support , wait and export@@ ing image files .
&amp; quot ; digital constitu@@ ency absor@@ bs , categor@@ ized , sec@@ ures , searches , conf@@ is@@ cated , conf@@ is@@ cated and exported contents of a mon@@ et@@ ty or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data from data . metadata is according to your definition data , to provide information about or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will probably not know how many photos you have , then use the metadata in a database as well as in the image files so you can use very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you have to do and know before you can manage anything in your system . your image files must somehow have to be organized on your computer . you must decide whether other access to your photos may want to store or on a net run &amp; etc . make sure you need to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location . if you have enough photos , then you will be able to organize sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . if you can download a folder for pictures you will print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , working processes , constant access of images on different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will be and you will not re@@ arrange your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . they will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture .
we also recommend the metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ al . this ensures that EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data can be stored into the file , then you can then select the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change what ? to this , &amp; digi@@ plug The metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are the main ones of course .
now the real work , as you should now select the keywords , labels and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that the same attribute will require and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos .
let &apos;s now let us talk with keywords , keywords like other programs often , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catal@@ og@@ ised images from another source with embedded sam@@ pler , it is not a problem and can easily place the tree in the tree ; it can easily be done by connecting a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are being done by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while the trees are pursued .
the graphics shows how different metadata is out@@ going . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool for Catal@@ og@@ ly@@ ze your metadata .
you want to just see your photos simply , you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , people , space .
and now I tell you this of the lan@@ dest@@ al place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical time span is again present , you may even hear the silence . the label thus has changed its perception of this panorama .
for others , consider your photos may be more important than the image itself . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help him to understand Him about the motive which you move is to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if the strength only has to work with an inscription for themselves alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can save as much text in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as an in@@ scri@@ bing . if you can even export your images in Web @-@ galleries , these labels will be able to tell you to your wishes and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery . you have to tell you a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was earth not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation drives already with light speed .
the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization can already be lost . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can view your journeys by shooting with ge@@ ographic data . and you can also view the photos on the site . you can also export the pictures from G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice the copyright to remove limitations about the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information is mentioned in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ al ; information is requested :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should have your name , or the name of the person that has been created . if it is not desired to protect the identity of the photographer , then it can no longer be changed . after that , it cannot be changed . this field does not support Tra@@ mas nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el ( syn@@ onymous with author ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples can be as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author field , this must also be completed .
publishers ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the bid@@ der field to identify who the picture offers . if the photographer is listed for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed below . if the picture is a stock photo here , the group / agency shows the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright section . anyone who has no protection against abuse . anyone who has no more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator . this is the solution to this problem only by low interest . for individuals , this protection is very important for individuals . for professionals and half professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . &amp; digi@@ p@@ ie ; in the near future , a module for stap@@ les processing is available .
topics : record error , panel failure , power failure , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , dessert , temperature , data size , spread super@@ st@@ itions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper shots or negative . in this section it is about problems with so @-@ called New Media .
roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , this c@@ auti@@ ous might have to be treated more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece has a life time of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your heart space room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ ks and good recording tools . the best DVD recording tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so , it &apos;s about choosing the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able to fault , even if you have just been writing a control function to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum . despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical ag@@ eing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to do wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; however , it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to gain the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ player Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual player DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good capture device to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . please read the media with a description , date &amp; author labels and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and protected animals protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
Disk@@ manufacturers keep your statistics for itself . your manufacturer &apos;s manufacturer include a new disk , but not the data . Google is providing a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives at your disposal : dis@@ mis@@ study
soon , during the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C , the most common error situation , SM@@ ART can not determine the most common error . some of SM@@ ART are unable to determine the immediate failure . these are particularly Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing teeth . the expected lifetime amounts between 4 and 5 years .
this is the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a current failure , but these losses can usually be produced without any major problems .
while most electric devices are not too much easier , this can take a difficult damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es may cause severe damage . thus , protect mother@@ boards and other defects , therefore protect themselves from the inev@@ itable that leads to loss of time and money .
the most popular protection against electricity points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of energy seats and rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug bar . but remember that not every plug @-@ in line contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . they should also ensure that it protects the protection against lighten@@ ing and protects the correctly connected devices .
since there is an over@@ voltage of any cable to your computer , you should also make sure that all the peri@@ pher@@ als that can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sp@@ ills which also include a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for co@@ axial cable of cable modems and television .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and they are also very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller sw@@ elling into the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of few seconds can cause the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore it can be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically save battery energy . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system . if you want a UPS to keep the same quality requirements , you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of battery and the supplied software may be interesting .
remember the potential risk that your host@@ ile system is exposed and compar@@ ing your safety in current problems with the costs at avo@@ iding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used as well as your computer with it . at the end you should always think of all cable to tr@@ enne before you stay in the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . using the right configuration , you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is a further popular deal with which you can store any amount of data .
compared to the hard drives at home , however , it is very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only suited as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but there is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available , in the case of Flickr dramatically more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked only in reality .
from the point of view of data protection , web solutions are very secure . transfer errors are automatically adjusted by the TCP protocol and in the large companies offer a backup and a di@@ ver@@ ted memory . therefore , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs set up the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that you have occurred when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have destroyed a photo and that &apos;s no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is much more secure data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transfers losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data stream . normal file system errors are un@@ noticed .
even if you are not especially affected by transfers , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems appears to be one of two candidates who can cope with record errors in low level and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon also for Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used for use and is also available for Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss during not@@ ebook and 46 % with the job systems . Not@@ ebooks are the proportion of theft 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most increases . it is limited to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted .
open source fil@@ esystem are less vulner@@ able to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to provide the common fil@@ esystem support here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are removed from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while technology is further developed , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deteri@@ or@@ ated for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit of 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not have any data loss for data loss . so do your data frequently be affected by a data loss . thus , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before using any thing as the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange records or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you take your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , one day , a flash , you &apos;re lucky when the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster defe@@ ats locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget planes alone : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole space or entire house .
therefore disaster prevention means always not local storage . get your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighbor@@ ing house , your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already mentioned is a common cause for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and const@@ itute a complete copy at a time .
differentiation of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential assurance .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can make the original status at any time to recover such a backup . this backup will only take a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is just off and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool which you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that have really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this approach allows you to recover enough time to detect and restore losses . at the end you come to a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
subjects : metadata , stored IP@@ TC data , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ loc@@ ating images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is roughly the time span that you are truly interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you have to consider all what is said today with caution . unfortunately , there is no other option to en@@ rol with caution . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible , the more easier is to rate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and saf@@ eke@@ eping technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is a specialist pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
let us assume that you have planned to put the scal@@ ability with a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this range and store it onto a new record :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new record has been detected by the system , but do not hang it up .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC # source ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate at MB@@ PCI ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and travel FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ du@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if no software can read it , then you can create this yourself . this task is easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , they should not use it any more .
PNG was developed as an open source standard of GIF . however , it can store much more . it can store much more . it is capable of backup X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , but it is a relative many administration information , but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression . this format we would recommend to store your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as an image format . it manages images in high quality or stored in a container with a loss@@ less comp@@ o@@ id@@ m ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) , but it &apos;s very large files . with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The digital negative file format is a licensed and open picture format developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed because of the needs of the camera image formats . DN@@ G is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon as well .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; a combination of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . it concerns the file information with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to archive the original size of your photo , mostly in the raw format . however , the metadata must be stored separately from the metadata file and the picture file will be displayed , so you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application @-@ purposes and business models . on the D@@ C@@ MI activities , work on architecture and workshops , standard conferences and workshops , standard connections and con@@ na@@ iss@@ ful efforts to reach a further acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are on the camera , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your primary archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the pictures back with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut under circumstances from other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc .
the camera @-@ interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ al . in the section Add a photo to an album you will find a description as you already have on your hard disk . but the camera interface makes you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album cover .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , connect it to the camera to turn off the camera to the display mode and switch it . a further description of the camera will be found in the manual of your camera .
when you launch the camera interface , this will take you to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a pre @-@ thumb@@ nail appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not display the thumb@@ nails for any file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . using the features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or metadata .
this dialog features file properties and the camera information , which is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all information available .
the tab Metad@@ ata shows the internal metadata , such as EX@@ IF , Manufac@@ ture , GPS , etc. of the image . these information are the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ al ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on the button is the click on the button downloading and then download the photos from her camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ al ; for downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to delete the photos from your camera before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , download the button downloading and then download selection . download the button selection is available as long as you have selected some photos .
when your camera supports this , a new option is available to download . in this case , the new pictures were available with a star in the incident . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
when you download the buttons available , download a dialog , with which you can download the target album , in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be displayed in section My albums . select the list of albums from the list and press OK .
after finishing the target album , press OK , and &amp; Go ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from your camera . you can delete all by using the button . if you want to delete it all , then you must select it first and then delete del@@ eting .
please note that there is no way to delete photos that you have deleted from the camera ; you should be fully deleted if you want to delete the photos in a &amp; digi@@ al deposit box . if you want to delete the camera system completely , you should read it more quickly .
cameras are often not used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently . the fil@@ en@@ ames can usually be recycled , if you load photos from the camera in the same album , so it may be useful , the date and time to which the image has been made to in@@ corporate the fil@@ ename .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirrors the picture and for date based subtitles . if you use this latter option , it will automatically create a folder per day .
the options During the transmission opens three additional options to be performed before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from EX@@ IF data into the IP@@ TC range . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want a different date format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file name in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer it .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ plug , is used for a photo , will be displayed below the name , displayed the camera in the preview . its settings for ren@@ aming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera &apos;s next time .
&amp; digi@@ al ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic turn during shut@@ down . not all cameras are available . in the side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information embedded in the picture .
the automatic rotation is switched ON , and when your camera does not deliver this information , the photo is set off . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the button rec@@ tan@@ gles and choose the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera has been made available , at which the photo was made , at the disposal of the picture . all images are loaded onto the picture album . all images with the same date are available in the same sub@@ title . all images with the same date are available . in the side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read out what information can be embedded in the photographs .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to change this , you have to disable this option and select the option Date @-@ based Sub@@ ver@@ bs at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is button downloading . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; will then be uploaded to which you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , it asks &amp; digi@@ al ; you , where the pictures should be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means that the data can be displayed in length and lat@@ itude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers it can be interesting to link with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic absorption of GPS data to map . environment plan , military , police , architectural office and property mak@@ ler can use this ability .
if you have forgotten your photo , where exactly the photo was made , you can click with a click to view the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous location , or just send it to this aspect , it is good to provide the position data of a photos .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 is supported by many GPS data fields such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , about a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to ge@@ ographic information ( manual ) and last beyond manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera that integ@@ rates a GPS unit . but there are a few who collabor@@ ated with GPS receivers or by sending the data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done by g@@ ps@@ one or G@@ PS@@ Babel . however , you have to save these data in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the geographical allocation .
there are several programs for Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length of the length and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script that works using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ positi@@ onal coordinates which are created for e.g. from map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com is no European street types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .

select action can be set to preview or launch image processing . thus , you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ al ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the stand@@ ar@@ did@@ acy and copyright issues . these data will automatically be selected in the IP@@ TC data base to download this data in the IP@@ TC fields as well .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el is a syn@@ onym for editor : this field should be a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a further description of the author &apos;s field , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to give the picture . this must not be the author , if this for a news agency like e.g. Reuters or Associated Press , then this organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency should be the picture available here .
IP@@ TC actions save the data into the respective IP@@ TC field . this way , the metadata must permanently appear in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ al . these metadata is also available and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ous data ; imported without getting lost .
images save as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the labels included in the images . thus , your lab@@ eling can also be read by other images , they will be over@@ written by the letters written by the digi@@ al code .
the page settings contains all options for information that appear when the mouse is resting in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats ; to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ al files ; Alb@@ um@@ file , which will not have any of these extensions , will be ignored by &amp; digi@@ al .
you can reset the default settings by press the button Update from each category .
the settings of the light@@ box of &amp; digi@@ al ; can then be set on this site if possible . some pictures have switched on . some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have a number of images and the synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better clear@@ ances .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can use the tool bar , when using the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are displayed here . in the image processing the mode of application can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the pictures are encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color form@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia .
with the PNG @-@ compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG @-@ files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : 1 low and 9 a high compression .
using the TIFF @-@ files option , you can use the de@@ fl@@ ate compression sal@@ ons for TIFF images . this reduces the size of TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is loss @-@ free .
with the setting @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can loss@@ less save . even if you are writing the loss @-@ liable setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than when this paragraph was not supported yet , however , metadata was not supported yet .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ al versions , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it &apos;s rapidly becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default reference is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option in ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option draws a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white comparison of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a solid color balance , which was shot on a white map that was shot in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors , this option will get more details in four stages . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the top sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your camera will begin to consider a sh@@ immer@@ ing white in the settings . the setting colors are generated by some unusual results , as it shows the nick@@ name in various rose tones . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing parts from the plants .
this is possible because blue pixels generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red shar@@ k . of course this is a question how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option to construct a level , it is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each picture individually .
put the Lumin@@ ance value to your li@@ king . you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ al ; and , to keep the time for hum@@ ility , should not be conservative .
one demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process that come from a complete picture of the partial image sensor that provides many cameras and provides a matrix @-@ coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ ach .
&amp; digi@@ w ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives at your disposal : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ Lev@@ in , but it produces colour art@@ acts on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear was interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can put the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color@@ ability correction , as it is carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color form@@ ations and gives instructions how they should be given again . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information such as the color form@@ ations of a color space in the other , so the colours are as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions , when a picture is opened in image processing / color administration module with raw files .
color Profile File Fol@@ lowing the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / color / color / color / / or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ al ; exam@@ ines this folder during the start .
the ICC profiles st@@ alls are available here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can be changed later when opening up the raw file .
the color scheme view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures colour@@ fully not administ@@ rated the entire screen .
the input profiles should be attached to the camera lock and model you are using . not all profiles are contained in the same way . currently , d@@ c@@ w Gamma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depths . this means that you must perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate as your image has to be given back as your printer has a smaller paint area as your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated , instead of depend on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile for them is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here &apos;s a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion makes the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; illustrated and image processing is supported ; many modules have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . then you will see the list of available modules and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond that you will find some also in the context menu of the preview pane .
Short@@ cuts for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu below Settings short commands .
more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide settings should simply be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust@@ s the time between the outputs , normally there are 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switches or out , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera characteristics appear on the left hand side a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right side , a button is automatically linked to identify the camera . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage are supported here .
at the bottom of the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / Camera or / m@@ nt / k@@ gs , where you can mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer and turn it up in the display mode .
check out if &amp; digi@@ plug got ; the camera will automatically detect . if not , you can set camera model and port manually after your camera is set up in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the option of confirmation of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can set up the dialogue of &amp; digi@@ b@@ bin . in the del@@ eting of a photo in one album , you can find more details to delete a photos and delete an album .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can still be shut down by &amp; digi@@ al ; if you use the option to use changes in the right side bar without consideration . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button changes .
you can also display the display of the welcome screen at &amp; digi@@ al ; starting to start , it acceler@@ ates the start@@ up process of &amp; digi@@ al .
at the start of the new photos , after new photos you were looking for new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the start time of &amp; digi@@ al . if something from the base file was deleted , it will ask you if it should delete it out of the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug . select the main window to your li@@ king . these settings can select from the tool@@ bar settings . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ al ; find further information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ al ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button on the thumb@@ nail and selecting the entry menu / Edit menu .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ al . so , they are not part of your distribution . you will find further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image processing section .
a flag line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file number , and the current image size shows .
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar for fast access to the most common functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should possibly produce a copy of your picture before you change it . this you can save save as possible .
as long as you have not stored the photo , you can rest@@ art the original image by using the Edit menu or restore the button Rec@@ over of the tool bar . then you lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last stay .
almost any action of imaging can be revers@@ ed and restored . the latest action can be revers@@ ed by selecting editing pane , or restore editing from the menu .
if you often use this , you should choose the short@@ cut short , C@@ trl ; -@@ z to reverse and specify C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the tool@@ bar button for a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will be revers@@ ed either .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword in the tool bar , picture up or the entries in the menu file . if you &apos;ve made any changes on the current photo , you will ask if you want to save them .
in the picture you can go in and out in that you C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the memory menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : enhance the expansion factor automatically
view Full screen saver displays the picture in full screen mode . you &apos;ll get to the normal view in which you want to use the Es@@ c button . if you don &apos;t want this , you can call this at the settings dialog of &amp; digi@@ al ; you can see this from the digi@@ plug . see the section for arran@@ ging the image processing .
when you want to print the current image , you can print image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or full sentences . all images from your selection can be printed out from your selection and choose from the menu Export printer wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ al window ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected image files , also available in image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders will be clicked on :
multiple Click on the same tab , the side@@ bar will appear or disappear again in the edges .
in the labelling view , you can enter or insert lab@@ s with unlimited size . note that the text is UTF @-@ 8 . that means that all the special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut according to 2000 characters . if you want to use IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after which you have commented on , use either the button , or switch to the next picture , the labels will be saved .
next to the Apply button there is one button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also read the metadata in the files . this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting , which is always written in the images .
this section shows a value scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to rate multiple images at the same time , select it from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keywords below shows a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the keyword and a selection box with previously applied keywords ; session applied .
the keyword is adapted dynam@@ ically to the given search word . you can re@@ tren@@ ch the number of options in search of a keyword fast . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom ends is another relief for typ@@ ing keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword in the IP@@ TC field .
if several pictures are selected in the main view , and choose a keyword in the keyword tree , and not apply to the whole selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword keyword .
the bar line filter bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar will be used with their album , - date , sample and view@@ points from the right , will only display the quantity of these two . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop you back in the main view . if the keyword is already exist , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . after that , a dialog you ask if you want to put the keyword .
in the top example shows the main window the images on a calendar day . the keyword fil@@ tering is reduced to one calendar day . you have been selected with Str@@ g + a , and then a keyword from the right @-@ right @-@ tree on the selection is drawn and put away . a dialog is asked if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes will take place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled via settings .
if you have a rule with and created and find out that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , which is searched in the database , can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is set in the database .
you can e.g. set a Extended search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options only , you just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to el@@ le for this work . I mostly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ al ; S specifically adjusted implementation .
the reason why one sets a color@@ able workflow , the colors of your camera or scanner can achieve a predic@@ table deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or engraved colors . with a color@@ able workflow , you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner which match the colors of your camera or scanner which match you from your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
if the subject comes to color management , then everyone wants to press the results he wants to press . unfortunately , colour scheme is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour management . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result .
if your photo @-@ level meets the criteria listed below , you must not take care of colour management .
you are working on a monitor of the s@@ RGB color space is calibr@@ ated . ( further information can be found below )
your only other educational issues are via e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so , if RGB works well and makes life for all so easy , then why should one use a different colour space and have to make thoughts about colour vulner@@ able ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colours we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spher@@ es , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ently and click on info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cra@@ ck my monitor , if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you will need to monitor your monitor using s@@ RGB that you will need to use your monitor on s@@ RGB at s@@ RGB , then you have to either use your monitor on s@@ RGB standard , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool makes five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attemp@@ ting a further manual processing .
the norm@@ alize , automatic , automatic and contrast , from the Men@@ rig@@ ate automatic correction try automatically to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled down the actual picture , so the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing his colour shades . this function is often a mag@@ ic correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
compens@@ ated : this method adjust@@ s the ligh@@ test factor in the colours of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity visible is as flat as possible . it is also only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation which causes either mar@@ vel at a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue canal . it determin@@ es the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels onto the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast enlarge : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by switching the lowest and highest values in the highest possible range and a re@@ group of all values in between . this is only visible when washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white equal to &amp; digi@@ al came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white ab@@ normal@@ y of a photos .
the white correction is slightly limited since an 8 @-@ bit color space is used , so far from the original image , areas can be performed with over@@ exposure . if you work the white ab@@ out@@ comes in the raw mode , your possibilities will be better to correction .
this tool is protected by the Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym protected by copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . click on the menu entry colors white comparison of the image processing .
the fore@@ front can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the tool can be seen . if you want to see the original white image , it &apos;s enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview photos has a red mar@@ kers . the Lumin@@ ance of Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right top is a hist@@ ogram shown that once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful because , even in well lit images , most pixels is very small Lumin@@ ance values . using a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow adjust@@ s you to enhance the shadow on your photos or down .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then anywhere in the image preview for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white bal@@ ancing . in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors , when more than a color channel of Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons stores save and load accurately this . every setting of the white bal@@ ancing allows you to save in a text file and then load them later .
the button def@@ aults all filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will be shown as your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding process per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is well suited for high quality images . this coding is also useful for high quality images . this coding is also available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assign@@ ments of colour profiles . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be drawn from the colour scheme .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors of audio correction . this tool allows you to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so you can also use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same error . in the manual for the audio correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ al ; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and an edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , has developed the effect of a short flash light and afterwards the development of the picture was completed . the result was a partial neg@@ atives of the picture . the result was a partial neg@@ atives of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
intensity controlled the solar condition . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase is finally a negative image that does not produce on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar power effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it processes ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ ation that makes it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name produced for a light @-@ optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus , a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are , but also some photograph@@ ers , especially those which hardly believe the landscapes .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast stit@@ ches . the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ light . with large pictures , the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it &apos;s not unusual to change the color counter@@ s and the brightness of the photos . you can experim@@ enting with the different color @-@ effects of your photos with the tools in the menu . once you &apos;re satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo on poor lighting conditions , you can reduce the satur@@ ation problem instead of increasing the satur@@ ation instead of increasing the satur@@ ation . all alter@@ ations you can carry out in preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool key correction for enh@@ ancing the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of sh@@ avers : in concrete , the three sl@@ bers below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sh@@ avers are clicked on into the side and the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the control is to move the kno@@ b and look at the same as the image changes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview can be dynam@@ ically modified , using the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this drop box can be adjusted , if the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a constant colour , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three kno@@ b : the upper for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ ize .
the three paint brush plates can be used in the preview of the original color to adjust the inputs of the shade , medium and bright tones . Moreover , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values , such as the output values , for example , can be used to create a spreading picture as background while something else is fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values .
save as well as loading : with these buttons , the saved values can be saved in the file system and later re@@ loaded . the Gimp level format is used .
if you are using this mode and the three color pi@@ ds , the input lines will automatically be adjusted for all shade , medium and solar noise . select the colour pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the program for red , green , blu@@ - and Lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator indicator controls all color channels to view over exposure pixels and you can view the combined results of all channels . this is an indicator , so you &apos;ll see the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the entran@@ ts applied to the red , green and blue canal of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , and output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and fixed image ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview can be dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fying channel : this drop is allowed to specify the canal that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures with a digital camera , the linear mode of a constant colour creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you post@@ p@@ one a short valves to the right , for example , the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are dar@@ ker with a dar@@ ker balance .
on the preview of the original photos , a red marking is shown . if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change it will create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . any curve that you created can be saved in file system and later loaded . the file format for this is Gimp Kur@@ ven@@ format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . select the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red , green , blue and Lumin@@ ance curve .
the check @-@ exposure indicator controls all colour channels to view over exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you will see the combined result . this is an indicator , so you &apos;ll see the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance canal . sh@@ ade@@ - and sunny tones used with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the Channel Mixer opens ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color scheme of the photos .
the Channel Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it from the Col@@ ors Channel Mixer .
with the edge selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window can be presented to you . the original can be viewed compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mar@@ kers . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to indicate the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and building allow you to activate these channels . if you are using Lumin@@ ance , this is especially convenient for creating great black and white conversion of your photos . try the green canal for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color becomes visible in the color canal and whose prey man looks different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you can reduce the color chips first .
save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save it later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp @-@ channel format .
the over@@ exposure indicator indicator controls all color channels to view over exposure pixels and you can view the combined results of all channels . this is an indicator , so you &apos;ll see the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the Lumin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the painted picture under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

with the digi@@ plug bag ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of it a color picture is or not , you can make it look like an old master , a pop type portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right to the depth or three dimensional of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see the relief model has been set to 200 .
with the digi@@ plug bag ; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not easy task . to keep the image an decorative border . this is a psychological barrier to the scatter@@ ing eye . in the picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you make the desired frame type for your image . continuously trans@@ forms the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , de@@ pressed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional setting . ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively add a brick frame with patterns .
width : specifies the frame width of the frame in percent . value range for width is 1 % to 50 % limited .
the target image is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original ratio . this is important for printing images , especially when you have used the tool following a aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can create simple a form@@ ulated text in an image at any place . this will also occur in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the picture , the larger the character set must be adapted . at the end , simply select a frame for the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; any attitude which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with &amp; digi@@ plug tool ; tool template you can put a sten@@ cil above a picture .
the image templates apply in the image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to add the PNG file format and should be able to add a copy of the file size . if you want to add your template around &amp; digi@@ ous ; send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ al ; mailing list digi@@ p@@ .org ...
if you use this tool for first time , you have to put your template folder with the kno@@ b base file in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start@@ up .
after the root folder for templates has been set a tree view that reflect the file structure of the templates . the selection of a folder will automatically update the templates of templates .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button is enlarged the underlying image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
reduction : this button closure the below picture below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shr@@ ink the picture according to the left mouse button .
move : use this button to shift the image below the template . take the image and put it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your image . the picture is then automatically adapted to preview size .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ø@@ n ; introduces three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you have advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very quick and simple , but creates especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharp@@ ly . you can use it more psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric d@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
this is perhaps the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . elements the smaller ones are combined with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras will normally need more int@@ ol@@ erable sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for the private use .
in JPEG pictures , the camera is often applied to internal sharp@@ ening . images in the raw format must always be sharp@@ ened during processing .
some scanners require a sharp@@ ening filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening @-@ sharp@@ ening . you can call it with the menu entry .
but you should avoid this though the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ening increases sharp@@ ening of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can focus on the sharp@@ ening of a picture . you can reach it by using Re@@ focus . on Re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw a bit soft than it is easier than to sharp@@ ening . use the tool to switch to the folder with the menu entry and experiment a little with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ k@@ eling is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the fil@@ let with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values will generate good results and should be first tried out . an increase of the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask to be strong , rust@@ ling and the impression of gr@@ ats are made close to sharp edges .
the radius looks like many pixels on each side of a edge through the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radio . they should therefore take pictures most in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is placed .
the sw@@ elling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the use difference @-@ amount . it can thus be used for a se@@ eding of the filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the teeth are exemp@@ ted from the sharp@@ ness and therefore has to avoid beauty errors in ch@@ okes , sky and water surface areas .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ cot filters . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the painted picture ( 2 ) . un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ cot was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling value = 0.@@ 0 .
the digi@@ plug @-@ in ; tool re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to use the copyright protected @-@ based encryption algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed . this is better than trying to sharp@@ ening the picture . it uses a better technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . this is the use of a sharp bend . Re@@ focus can usually start better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ ks . you can start from the menu by calling colors reflection in the image processing .
in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s split . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s split has a very long tail , which will depend on the origin@@ ate pixel pixels , which is widely influenced by the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel pixels , even in most cases , even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . those caused unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular F@@ ill . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should look very un@@ sharp , then on holy icons .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation is reduced to the sharp@@ ening effect of the module .
rob@@ ber@@ filter : the filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values of 0 @-@ 1 can help you . however , values are very low as 0.1 . if the space filter is too low , and eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a useful value is 0.0@@ 3 . a high value is to still cont@@ am@@ inate the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should avoid this value to 0 , to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a value to zero , you may also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the space filter .
matrix size : this value determin@@ es the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in matrix size can produce good results , particularly if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s focus . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any rever@@ b parameter you have set will thus be saved for later and then can be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intens@@ ities on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible , but the later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts are left behind .
when reading and comp@@ ress images , eg . when JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ ks produce better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be causing un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red meas@@ les a bigger neighborhood use as sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically clear mas@@ c@@ ures must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the infin@@ ity . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters it is always at least as good as the un@@ har@@ p mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better with the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different fil@@ tering , on a small focused image :
the original un@@ clear color picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the focused result is attri@@ but@@ able to auto @-@ focus lens lens .
for more information on the methods for sharp@@ ening correction in dig@@ iti@@ zation , you can consult a technical comparison in English at this address .
the kno@@ b &apos;s kno@@ b uses the sharp@@ ness of the range of darkness to produce a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour tin@@ ent makes a customized color for the pup@@ il . in case you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the designed tool designed to remove non @-@ desired arti@@ facts with be@@ is@@ pi@@ ell@@ os@@ er speed .
the In@@ jection algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g @-@ Project .
this tool contains various def@@ aults as a starting point to simpli@@ fy restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small amount led to a smooth smooth regions of smooth regions and details sharp . a value of 0.9 % should get details so that no sharp@@ ening should be necessary . please note that the details should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
direction @-@ dependence Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small scale smoo@@ ths evenly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film @-@ grain or CCD noise , a high value of similar pattern would produce similar pattern . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor about all@@ es@@ . p defined the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , put this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ p effect , it needs to be higher than 3 .
rep@@ et@@ itions : as often the algorithm is run through . normally , 1 or 2 is usually sufficient .
angular step@@ wise as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha small is chosen , then it should also be small to generate a long runtime . so you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ ets and never exceed 2 .
we use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is only minor . it doubles the running time . therefore , we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons save as and load precisely this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later be loaded again .
correct error correction is compar@@ atively very fast when working . however , it may take a long last time and load a high CPU load after it . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below you can see how image errors can be removed with small arti@@ facts . as you see , it is shown on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the original image is under ( 1 ) and the fixed image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ ous reduction ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing image noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ el .
this tool displays selectable image filter , to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , i.e. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of single @-@ sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor noise of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you need only the details pane and the Advanced Settings window can stay in default settings .
radius is controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time the filters per pixel are needed and can be the image hidden on the picture and the color in it is smoo@@ ther and therefore smaller mistakes can be adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch to check the filter backwards . if the value is too high if the value is too high when the value is too high , adap@@ tive filters can no longer receive and cra@@ fting , or dirt again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response . if it is too strong , the whole noise can be removed or cat@@ er@@ aser can occur . put it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak room or JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the illumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
colour : controls the color toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ant values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically are stronger to increase , but it is cont@@ am@@ inated , however , the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius . if it is increased , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter will appear on the edges . it can remove the noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . it can remove pre@@ dat@@ or and is the recommended method .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the reduction , which you have set , can be saved into the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how spatial reducing your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and fixed with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw a bit soft than a picture is fortunately enough to create a picture with the menu entry Kor@@ rig@@ ating and experiment with the plain list . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ al plans ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photograph@@ ic files .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film kern@@ els , scrat@@ ches , compression and recre@@ ating images in digital , original or subsequently bri@@ mming with digital images and thereby gets the content as it is also the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the tex@@ tures is performed using another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ á and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss@@ less comp@@ ress , it generates some comp@@ resses &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image .
the buttons save as and load precisely this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it may take a long last time and take a high CPU load after moving . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below , you can reduce how to reduce your photo with a like spac@@ ing .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken up with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film baskets on the faces . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo taken by a scanner that could see from the scanner lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the fixed image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug , tool Hot@@ jam makes it possible to remove any hot pixel programs with a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly high with high quality raw materials , because many cameras with JPEG compression is equipped with a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &apos; quot ; light pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark sub@@ tra@@ ction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button Dark . the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you absor@@ b the dark picture right in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark picture to the correct image . note that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and automatically loads that automatically in the next session .
the image and the preview can help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the fil@@ tering with current settings . poor pixels are emphas@@ ized in all thumb@@ nails .
choose an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter to see . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ation : an average of the neighbor@@ ing pixels is determined . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ec@@ tives from the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block would be used to comp@@ ose a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , and then they are used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ename method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block is drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction in a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ing , the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug @-@ correction is a tool for correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. the exposed corners of an image to correct .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the edges and edges of the picture by bringing the light the sensor there .
but also dis@@ advantages . many Center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 while the aper@@ ture filter , which should be impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be able to use the Center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ening effects are caused by movement .
with the great expos@@ ing areas of today &apos;s film and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using a equivalent transformation in a picture based without these filters . the tool Vig@@ net@@ tier@@ rez correction , the transformation of a C@@ enter@@ Filter is applied to a picture . the algorithm is protected by the copyright of John Walker .
with three Reg@@ lers you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction @-@ correction and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density the filter . the default density amounts to 2.0 , or randomly to offset the density by a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting to compens@@ ate it by a small degree .
Leu@@ ch strength , contrast and gamma settings : the editing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is decre@@ asing the brightness of the pixels . they must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options only , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want to adjust a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , so let the values for brightness / contrast / Gamma at zero and use gra@@ dation out of the &amp; digi@@ al ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ scape correction to be applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ization in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a cand@@ le@@ pro@@ p and contrast correction was also performed in the picture with this tool .
the digi@@ plug came ; Lin@@ king dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . colour dist@@ or@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the second degree of frames covers the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but falls off on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the removed rough opposite to the second degree . if you combine these two , every geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion is almost eliminated .
General : this value controls the thickness of the dist@@ ortion second gravity . with negative values , t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical dist@@ or@@ tions can be corrected and positive values for cut@@ out dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion fourth gra@@ des . this value is stronger to the edges as in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the opposite number has the opposite number of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and result in a correction of first gra@@ ding . negative values increase the picture by positive .
radiant : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustr@@ ating the dist@@ ortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and the next start@@ up as default values are used .
the t@@ onn@@ al and c@@ is@@ ular correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or size changes . best result , perform this correction than any first . if you do a painting and then perform a t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction , the effect would seem obvious .
to help you find the best correction for you , this tool puts you a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it into an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection you can correct the t@@ onn@@ al / c@@ is@@ ular dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you correct a cold @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them from the thumb@@ nail to cut out from the image processing or zoom in this dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next logical step for some images is enough . the next logical step for some mot@@ i@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is re@@ produced under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range from 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters to sim@@ ulate film grain and film sensitivity . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter colour channels are mixed with infrared film , especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the Far@@ bin@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of the infrared film based on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image of the film was set to ISO 400 . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the plants .
the &amp; digi@@ al filter has a simple @-@ used tool to re@@ produce film baskets on your pictures . this is known by classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , for the sensitivity of the films the manufacturers of large silver @-@ emul@@ sion .
the film indicator gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , Galerie @-@ like , road photograph@@ ic , gra@@ ce@@ ful vision especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ms photos , so you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated for control of the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more gra@@ ins , then you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of film @-@ effects applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity complies with ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ plug filter ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of a oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug filter ; filter oil paintings gives up your digital images a nice appearance like oil paintings . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited for big images . smooth the smoo@@ thing or , from the other side seen from the other side .
this is an example of the oil paintings effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the working size is marked with the ( 2 ) image size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and Gl@@ itter 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug filter ; filter coal use uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage . therefore , their gra@@ dients vary slowly but not ideal for this effect . it is helpful to imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( deposit ) .
this is an example of the carbon filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default value of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug filter ; filter engraving shaped your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug Fil@@ ur ; Fil@@ ur is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important content of content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ken landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the painted picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter assembly you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by means of dist@@ ortion effects . it uses ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave streams 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells and let it look like it is seen through glass blocks .
waves 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button .
with this filter assembly you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by means of un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . additionally it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom F@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the image along the circular lines going out from a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of often visible in sports photography .
radi@@ al im@@ p : wi@@ ped the image by rotating the pixels around a focus . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a turning camera .
rein@@ force : wi@@ pe the image to generate the effect of un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed camera lenses . the object seems to appear in the background .
motion @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ic , camera .
sharp@@ ness : get the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ images , or add a warm and subtle glow .
sh@@ akes un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image by random shi@@ fting of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent Dis@@ closure : find the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo into rectangular cells and then we created it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ing on your image . this makes it natural your pictures an impressive appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by copyright algorithm .
let the dri@@ p size allowed it to change the size of the image . because the dri@@ p size doesn &apos;t automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size and density of drop . Fisch@@ au@@ gen changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
you can keep an area free of rain drops at the digi@@ plug . use the selection tool for the area , e.g. a face that should remain free of charge . if you start the filter shelf , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the shelf Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can take it by mirrors or rotating in the right orientation . you can find tools in the menu transformer , or transform .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture of resi@@ du@@ es is simple . the big question is , how can you invent a picture and see the details ? how can you invent the missing information ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information here ? how can one find a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size and specify the target values in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
to change the tool , use a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ lin@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ al ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and will be listed below :
maintain a aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the size of the original size is the original ratio of the origin@@ als .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ ence effect , it needs to be higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and load are used exactly to them . any single file for photo can be saved as text file and later be loaded .
photo infl@@ ate is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a long last and a high CPU load after moving . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
you can see an example of photo bubbles , by selecting a small paint volume on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear extension to comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a very under@@ estimated tool to al@@ locate a picture . to make a photo you have to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . as a result , you will make a good overview as your photo will look after cutting . a new rect@@ angle can create by using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the access point , use the button The Cut@@ ting button of the image processing in tool@@ bar and the photo is added ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use File As Save or File As in the File menu to save the newly allocated photo .
in the Pre@@ view area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialog , remains .
in the tool following a aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in high @-@ format it is always assigned to the larger value of the height and in the landscape .
the tool for aspect rati@@ os uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same as regardless of whether you can use c@@ entimeter , In@@ ch or any other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
below , you can set the max . relationship button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool following a aspect ratio under@@ cut its settings depending on the image @-@ orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are stored as default value in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly assistance may include help , so that you can assemble your pictures . these are :
harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . such as the third @-@ rule , harmon@@ ic triangles are a way to alig@@ ned a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles at the diagonal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division divided into various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ il@@ us shell or the leaf blades a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used with ancient Egyptians and Greeks , who used to construct your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you assemble your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i row 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two . the resulting divider is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 . a composition that is usually follows as a visually harmonious .
the golden middle provides liquid aid lines when you merge a painting . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to third @-@ rule , the golden spiral is generating a liquid line of the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiritu@@ als , also called gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles have been used to guide the eye to the focal point of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can be just as one without the eye to guide , it will accomplish his job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the golden triangles are also der@@ ive from the above mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , gold triangles are not equ@@ alled to the triangles . diagonal to these lines can be a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden triangles to set up your frame , create a effect of the professional photographer &apos;s dynamic sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your photo focus on one of the cros@@ sings and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach .
the options horizontal mirror and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonious back@@ ups .
using the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . on this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things have turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ al settings ; press the right rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are set in degrees . using the button pre@@ ferences , you can reset the push back on 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the top right .
at your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line to position . after moving it over an important point of the picture , you can aff@@ ix it with a print on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is the function transform@@ ers out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut . choose one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ gn@@ ment option smoo@@ ths the picture a bit after rotation . however , observe the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tive trans@@ form@@ ations are carried out to be a fixation point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the upper left : displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle to the top : displays the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly cont@@ am@@ inated . for a single adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the prosp@@ ect , you get rel@@ ati@@ fying tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to follow this is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing .
the ignition tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part in the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . with other words , a rect@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformer sciss@@ ors .
push your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical corners . if you press pre@@ ferences , the angle can be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
at your help a vertical and a horizontal line are inserted . move the mouse to an important point , such as the Lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the line . you can now adjust the tool@@ box to adjust your image .
after which you have done the calibration , the picture becomes a bit sc@@ anned . for a single shooting , this effect is often neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shr@@ ink@@ ages are caused twice as much che@@ ering and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shooting , the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut out the image with transformation from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ al ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images from your system and , in some cases , from what kind of libraries are comp@@ iling from . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ al .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats on their system . but you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; digi@@ al ; shows only files in formats that are listed . this happens to display the file extension and a comparison list with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions ; you can modify this list of file extensions ; you can find further information here .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras can even be used to use it . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ al ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be loss@@ y if this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the picture format , you can read using Wikipedia , The Lumin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour very helpful tut@@ orials in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw material converted by &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ al modules .
&amp; digi@@ al ; supports the loading of cru@@ de images just with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ al ; all of this cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . table below shows a short list of raw file formats supported by &amp; digi@@ al ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; however , this video will be displayed in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; however , it is not a screening program and it has no built @-@ in options to view or edit it ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play films to play the program for playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in the Chron@@ icles . you can only go forward when you went back .

all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera to add a new camera to the list . please check in the camera section for further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module exports a series of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good when the initial contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four adjustments with the tin@@ ab@@ ine module .
many tools you need the photo processing are in &amp; digi@@ ous content . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , m@@ oll@@ us@@ ks , rou@@ gh@@ ing , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp@@ ly mas@@ c@@ ate , &amp; etc . use a uniform dialog box before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture . ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress indicator shows the status of the filter to the current image . links of him allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ative mode of the procedure . these modes are :
vertically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter to the field on the right of the selected image area .
horizont@@ ally sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower part indicates the filters below the selected image area .
share vertically . the left area displays the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
split horizont@@ ally . the upper area displays the original and the lower part to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nail and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse inside the image and take on the part of the picture , from which you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset your buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is mostly explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider puts an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to extract a square . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally uses the images of your imag@@ ery Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing colour pall@@ ets and selecting and h@@ itting from colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are located in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot Custom color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of panels installed or search the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color next . the colour is described below the palm tree . here also the color name can be changed .
he can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m cur@@ sor is inserted under the button color , the color will be inserted into the cur@@ sor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode of over@@ writing was selected . this mode allows you to select over@@ writing under the cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , slic@@ ing and inser@@ tion .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the propor@@ tions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line of line , if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; added .
the colors in the palette and the output of colors can be pulled with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ it ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI @-@ program to visu@@ alize graphics . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are linked to the program author and X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few features .
the &amp; k@@ art viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphics surface with all features of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program to replace .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . &amp; graph@@ s ; displays are free layout programs . &amp; graphics viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :

further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pre@@ places &amp; graph@@ it ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of graph@@ s . required in detail :
the main window displays the open graph , each in a separate window . at the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; without a argument , the tool bar is open as the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last open files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview will be displayed in the corner if Graph &apos;s Graph tab is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position in this overview with the context menu .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions with a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file is currently in &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be shown :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change , so you can change your decision later , so that later you can change your decision later , you can use the menu item settings ; set up ... see also .
if you want a graph with a running &amp; k@@ screen ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in file browser or in the command line , you have the option to open a new &amp; k@@ screen ; -@@ instance will want to open or want to display the loading graph@@ s in a sub@@ section of the already current instance .
as with the last option , you can permanently save your choice but also change them with the setup dialog .
in program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split up to multiple sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you are using several pages , you can select whether the parts of the graph will be on one page , and the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by different parts of the graph .

if you select the option to upload the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken out of the maximum size registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the pictures . the size is so altered the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool for export@@ ing your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I Module gallery export still has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ ed@@ . note : the participants of this list speak English .
the IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image and the geographical data are stored in an external browser in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization is available to locate images of geograph@@ ically in spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system that is used by GPS and Galileo . altitude , long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in the GP@@ X format . G@@ PS@@ Babel and g@@ ps@@ one can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
choose the pictures you wish to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to upload a possible cor@@ relation through time and loc@@ alization , you must download a trace file with GP@@ X file , of course data that have been recorded in the same time as images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , the coordinates is performed in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore must be converted to GMT time . this can be done with the time zone . use the time zone here .
the maximum deviation for the maximum time vari@@ ance is the maximum deviation for GPS time and camera @-@ time . the deviation among them are merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
the options of inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have a suitable data . if you know that in reality a location difference between camera and GPS , you can place these limits and press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same location . since the dialog you use the coordinates to the next notice , you only have to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and can be found . in addition , select this region and increase the corresponding precision . the map must always be selected manually . the map can be always picked manually . the map can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to mount GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages . you can select the albums created as HTML pages . the character set will be coded for HTML pages . the character set will enable UTF @-@ 8 to enable the binding internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . these albums are not allowed to select any of these albums . the albums are not hier@@ arch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below is the Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ preview and the text that will appear in the HTML page .
the rider aspect defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is mostly expl@@ aining a page . if you click on a picture a new page will be displayed in the image . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed .
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG File Format , the EX@@ IF data of your original images are also stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . it naturally affects the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the Reiter thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images that will be displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press off break down the process .
if the module has generated the pages , the window will not be shut down . therefore , you can click to display whether error occurred during production . the web browser will automatically display at the end to preview the preview pane . press the module to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allowed it to view a selection of images and perform on them basic operations such as screen@@ shots , zo@@ oming or shi@@ fts . the viewer can be used with short @-@ hand and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG - loss @-@ free module is a tool to change images without blocking your quality .
this module allows for the actions listed below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss@@ less storage it is the file size rises , since there is no compression of the color form@@ ations taking place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ click is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ click currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ ed@@ . note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from a picture to another . then , select the import function to which you want to copy the target picture , so the picture to which you will copy the metadata . the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in a di@@ az@@ au format .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected image to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slides .
all images are sc@@ aled on the correct size for the selected video format . additionally you can create a background color for the slide show . with this module , it is possible to create DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you need to select the images that are packed into MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can create via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to start the module .
the pictures selected from you are then listed in the portfolio . there , you can also change sorting the images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you are planning to re @-@ create the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds which is displayed in seconds . a lower value produces very sudden , a high contrast is very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . name and path of created file can be determined under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . if possible , keep the extension .
if you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . after you can start all settings your wishes , you can quickly or enjoy a coffee in all the rest and enjoy the di@@ ets if you are back again .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , then you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right below .
the print wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on one sheet paper together in standard phot@@ ogram . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print on with the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your files stored in one of three formats to JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : don &apos;t expect the same results as the software of your camera carrier . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ wler .
first , select the RAW file to convert and run the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . using this button you can preview the effect of your current settings .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides , if the camera settings can be adjusted for the white balance . the key parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera has no effect in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the fil@@ ename remains immediately and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG is using a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses the loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you prefer to use your pictures frequently or later , you should not use the JPEG format , as it is only allowed a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that are stored in the RAW file are stored in the EX@@ IF data in the JPEG file .
if you have adapted your settings , start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can also use Cancel button .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , this is helpful to automatically over@@ write the file . however , this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . a preview pane indicates how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the image file from I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of one album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several pictures of a picture collection . it uses the image of images from I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick Pack . you can make the image smaller or larger . in addition , four types of image change will be provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be automatically selected , depending on image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen format .
proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio will be changed during this option .
printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , mar@@ g@@ inal size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . there is also possible to change the size of the des@@ elect pictures before . more pictures can be moved on the list of selected images and place there .
after you have started the module , the pictures will be shown with the images displayed by you . via the button pictures you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the recently selected image will be shown a preview on the right side .
you can also drag images on the picture list and add the list of images to be saved .
with the button pictures you will remove the selected pictures from the list of selected images .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open all your e @-@ mail click with button OK . you have to add just the addresses and the subject line . the pictures selected from you are attached below .
don &apos;t be sure to send many images at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts are constra@@ ints for the size of sending e @-@ mails . there is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and once again used until you change them .
choose your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must have to install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer before download it here .
after the selection of comments in a set @-@ out file the comments will be added to the images in a text file .
the PNG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adjusted among the loss@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures file format and select the original files in JPEG format , then the original ext@@ if@@ data will be added to sensitive images .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut you up in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . using the button , you can shoot this window ? EN .
after starting the module &apos;s advanced di@@ az@@ au you will want to see a window with questions like you want your slide show . you can select between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions in the presentation use very elegant picture processes using Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graph card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the fil@@ ename of fil@@ ename ensures that the fil@@ ename of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . then you can manually cancel the menu with Es@@ c ; Cancel reply .
the pictures randomly select that the images are shown in random order . so the order of images will not be used in the album .
in delay between the pictures , the temp@@ oral distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should , so , before you show the presentation to your friends !
there is more than a dozen transition effects that you can choose from . acci@@ dental cho@@ oses a different effect during each transition .
during the slide show you can access a tool bar at the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch .
with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the di@@ az@@ au .
at the left , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ ed@@ . note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the work surface .
this module uses the current selected image , depending on the selected option of the menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have signed your pictures and videos with remarks , you can use &amp; photo album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , in people , places , and in group keywords items are available .
in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you have entered information as you have entered information and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF data to look at your hard disk and of course the current views of view .
when you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you select another person only the images will be displayed on which both persons are visible . by this selection method , you can re@@ tren@@ ch the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view images to view the images of your area .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can save with &amp; Photo@@ Album ; however , for each person has their own view , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined itself . see also the image .
to view images beside the name , select the button , which is located right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . it has the advantage that you can display them e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of sample words ( if you don &apos;t have any appropriate pictures ) .
however , you need to specify which image will be displayed for each individual person . in order to view this , you have to select the image for each individual . here you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the image window , you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image will be displayed and cut off .
if you are in the main window to search the entry , you will see a dialog , which is very similar to dialog for fixing the image properties . this dialog you can see on the picture again .
if you enter a string into the field label or description , the labelling and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text , for example , you can also enter a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , as for example 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however not Anne Hel@@ ene is depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather try to test functions , you have the following alternatives to this hand@@ book :
go on the homepage of &amp; Photo@@ Album ; and take a look at the quick , the screens and the introduction videos .
start &amp; photo album ; and in the first dialog , choose the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; go to the first time , or choose the menu entry / photo@@ album . you &apos;ll get some example pictures and you can test the functions of &amp; photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you &apos;ll find it on the homepage of &amp; Photo@@ Album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; cl@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : as the name suggests , this l@@ ad will show you data st@@ ats about the images in your database .
the time line can display you several different time units . every LEICA shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture , you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used on the following ways : you can select the displayed items preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the time frame will always be displayed in the preview window ) and the time bar displays the current date displayed when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a range of time bar by holding the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time line , i.e. the time data , so the time indication is displayed . if you select a range , you &apos;ll cancel the selection only by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; Photo@@ Album ; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , you can create the software in &amp; photo album , which you can create via the HTML menu .
before HTML pages have to be created , you have to make some settings . these are split into the three areas of content , layout and destination .
first , enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; photo album is created ; export file will be created on the viewing site . if you can find information about export files you will find in .
finally , you can select which information can be displayed on HTML pages . so , for example , all images from a party are obvious . for example , all images from a party are obvious . for example , all pictures from a party . note that this setting is not used to hide certain pictures from certain viewers .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the settings are clear , which is why not specifically made .
at the bottom of the site , you can set different resolutions for the images . this way , those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution of 800x@@ 600 , no more images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer you can change the resolution at any time you have laid down . he can then browse your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time , browse if he wants to see a picture larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this settings area , you specify the various folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best , choose a basic file for all of your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and next time you can select the memory location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE supporting protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if the URL is created for a URL , a web browser after the pages have been created . if you select a URL , you should select this folder . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder .
if the files created from you are not yet in the final destination folders you need to manually copy it manually . this is the import function to specify the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders can be found .
the just setting options have shifted all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will create , whose name you can define into output folder .
if you &apos;re looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may , of course , want to add a HTML page to view the images . you can , of course , have a lot of time to view the images , shooting location , etc . , you will have to do this job yet again .
with &amp; Photo@@ Album ; you can export a copy of your pictures to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import them into your database . the image characteristics are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file , or if the file is only a short@@ cut to save images . the advantage of all pictures in the file is that you can share all the pictures and this file is so independent . the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for two times . first the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , searches , if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which you can export via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act as internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
to manually copy the Manu@@ ally to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically copy the copy of the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are regular Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s usually not willing to comp@@ ress the files so you simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is limit maximum image size . if you don &apos;t want to send your friends pictures , since the .@@ k@@ im file would not be very big . here you can limit the size by allowing for example that each image will be up to 800 pixels high and wide .
if you import a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Import ... , &amp; photo@@ album ; import database files as described in .
the assistant for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , in which folder the import images should be copied .
it can be that you can person@@ alize the category people who are import@@ ing too import@@ ing file staff ( if you are a domain ) , while this category should be imported in the third dialog box , which categories of the imported file are to be imported and what categories comply with these in your database .
in the fourth step , you can get the categories of the imported file using the categories of your current database . an example for this is to be seen on the image .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you want to watch pictures from different image groups and see a picture with your friend on it , you may wish to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you &apos;ll find the different steps ( 1 ) Fest@@ ing information about your pictures , through ( 2 ) searching and watching , through ( 3 ) advanced themes and adjustment possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . it was extended and today , it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book it is talked about images , but often it includes videos with one .
&amp; Photo@@ Album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copying to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; photo album ; remember the folder , where your pictures are stored and uses this in future Star@@ ts . if you want to start a different folder with images , you can start a different folder with images . for example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings for photo album ; set up ... to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; Photo@@ Album ; in the following section of the user manual you will be explained by different settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access the preview options and the options for the viewer . for each attitude you can call for a detailed assistance to the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been described you how to set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for any existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up whole member@@ groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all groups of a member .
in view the settings that you are available for taking the list of members . in the left @-@ list box you can select the category . in the left window h@@ emisph@@ ere you can configure the list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; Photo@@ Album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . find information on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules are used together by several applications , it may be possible to test the modules with &amp; photo album ; you should always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album / demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I can be very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; photo album ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you share features with various applications .
the greatest difference between &amp; Photo@@ Album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : this kind of order is not supported for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sim@@ ulates &amp; Photo@@ Album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; the current album , which meets the current view , thus shows all images that shows you the picture preview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to the current album , &amp; photo album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here are &amp; photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then every entry in this category is an album for the module .
or there will be the category you &apos;ve specified in the settings dialog by category for virtual albums , for example , if you are using the category persons , will &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so whether you have chosen to add people to view this module .
since some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of the modules . start the settings dialog , and choose which modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you can start &amp; photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window that you can browse through your image . at the moment , you don &apos;t have any information about your image databases . in the section we will not show you any information about your pictures . in the section we will see you at this window , which shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; photo@@ album ; this is the possibility to see each image with remarks . this includes information about the persons , which is shown on the picture , or for a larger number of pictures , may be shown simultaneously . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and brow@@ ses , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in you can see three lists with a text box by selecting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; as you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the shift of images within the list : for example , if you have a family party , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown , so that the names used up are post@@ pon@@ ed to find persons more quickly and assign them .
if you prefer to see an alphabet@@ ically sorted list , click the symbol for sorting after date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture , you may wish to edit all the selected images and add these images with notes . simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the upper right above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles , and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a special symbol , a special symbol is displayed .
in context menu of the note dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also make an entry into a category and place there in order to make this entry into a sub@@ category . attention , this assumes that you are currently sorting out your categories .
you can move the individual elements of the note dial@@ ogs by form the vest that the upper edge of the frame form , click and move . you can also make your own window by moving it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the layout of the window so to your needs , click on the button Options ... that allows you to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also view a frame completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and then window a / out window . this process will see you in the picture .
if you are looking to view images in your browser , you &apos;ll get an overview with thumb@@ nails at the currently selected pictures , or all images you can &apos;t see the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle button on the mouse , follow it .
if you drop an image on the back of your desktop , this picture will be set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this image viewer will be displayed . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the imag@@ ery . simply select the images from which you want to delete and press the menu Edit menu . now , select the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; Photo@@ Album ; you can also use this problem for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images anywhere you can find on your hard disk . in the picture , you &apos;ll have to view the images anywhere in the database . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; Photo@@ Album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , on which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the images are displayed ; for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are displayed ; you can also view these images from the image viewer .
as you see , you need to copy this function to copy files from folders and copy them back to the CD . if you want to avoid anger , how to avoid h@@ enc@@ e@@ ering your pictures , please buy a bigger hard drive to store all images .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to remain a little more privacy you want to watch the pictures so that you may want to see for others un@@ accessible and click on current view , you can also see all the pictures you want to see for everything except current view .
in this case , you have laid out what images should be hidden in the case of your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , making all the pictures you have blocked , hidden out . if you want to see the images again , click on lock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also possible to specify a password which needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set this password , simply select password in the menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please note that this picture protection is not very secure . for one of these images on the hard disk and to the other , everyone can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml , which allows you to read out the password as un@@ coded text ; not very familiar to deny the look to private pictures .
the reason why you can spend all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and hours talk about hours that you want to look at some point . for this reason , &amp; photo@@ album . this is why you can preview them from the preview as described in .
the viewer you can see in . it shows course the picture , but additional all information you have shown on the image , like who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the top part of the picture you can see , so you can easily configure what information is displayed and elsewhere . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . so the appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser doesn &apos;t show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene would have chosen .
if you have loaded several pictures at the viewer you can jump between them and return by using the buttons ( high and picture ) . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer you can run this as a slide show . then you can get a new picture after a few seconds . how often a new picture can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus the di@@ ets by pressing C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability to view &amp; photo@@ album . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire room on screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can go into the picture and go out into the picture . with the mouse button you can re@@ zoom out the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t into the middle of the picture . showing how a Zoom rect@@ angle is marked and displays the result of ZO@@ OMS .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the equation , the ZO@@ OMS is set to ZO@@ OMS , so that every pixel is equivalent to a pixel image .
note that only zo@@ om@@ operations are working with videos that are in and out @-@ zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
you can turn the images from the context menu . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make remarks on the current image from the context menu .
if you have seen pictures , you can take a picture with a person whose name you may have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can check the picture and configuration dialog of the picture to mark this name . but you will be able to mark the picture and see more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to see what photos you want to start on paper . to see what photos you want to start with the pictures and see them as good or bad , while you see one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer will give you the opportunity to view images with characteristics when you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that press the appropriate letters . in view , see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these will be available in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you want , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and characteristics can be displayed in the view view . if you show categories in D@@ re preview , then you can press features to the images , simply press the characters for the feature , after the image has been selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you are allowed to paint &amp; photo album ; on the picture .
the painted box will not be saved with the image but in the database . on the way you can reverse your mixture later .
in view , you can see a picture on the painted . to switch on the painting mode from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply put the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; do not have to rule the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should absolutely be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the TV screens .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all accommodation objects are already selected with the object .
to add a new item in the object tree , select the item you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following pull @-@ down menu will allow you to select the right position :
by del@@ eting either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click on Apply to Apply this amend@@ ments . if you have invalid values , you may click the input errors and return to suit or cancel the changes with dis@@ rup@@ ting .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter a user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object by means of help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the self @-@ view view .
press a preview in the self @-@ view and a small example of the scene will be selected using the selected texture . if you want to select a sub@@ ordin@@ ate element ( for example , a texture within a texture Map and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shi@@ fting by pulling the mouse inside the window .
each object has an visibility level as wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed if they are selected or the Vis@@ i@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the scene selected in the tool bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window system or if you need another arrangement , you can also specify multiple shut@@ ters and switch between different orders .
to anch@@ oring a window with or under an existing view , drag the beginner to the upper or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to assign several views to another , drag the host@@ ile in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map leaders in the top .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views , which are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to get a view from the anch@@ oring point or click on the small to the left top of the arrow in the early water bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for each kind of views . new views are woven , you can anchor on any location .
the current window view , you can save with window arrangement ... save . it will be a dialog displayed in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program must be installed properly . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 up to date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry to the scene .
a RE@@ N@@ DER mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini @-@ files . it determin@@ es the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can specify as many RE@@ N@@ DER modes , from a fast preview up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the icon The RE@@ N@@ DER or the tool@@ bar icon or in the menu View RE@@ N@@ DER modes ... the following dialog is opened :
each RE@@ N@@ DER mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the mode of mode .
in the card size , you can add the width and height of the bl@@ ender image . if you wish to render only a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the picture section to ren@@ dering the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the properties that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you can use a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the RE@@ N@@ DER features can be found in the user manual at &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rot@@ ated with only one ray each pixel , there may be different mistakes . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ c@@ effects in curves and lines , besides , details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally , pictures look better with this feature .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connect to P@@ ov@@ ray ; this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as default is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive , because every pixel are always split up and adap@@ tive , because every pixel is continually expanding and adap@@ tive by the calculated value of the calculated color value .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray re@@ jects a ray pixels , then both pixels will be adjusted to the given threshold of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 points will be charged with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 R@@ ays per pixel . if the difference between the colours , the pixels will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be followed individually and to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ess is set up with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it is calculated very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this cardboard box , you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the proper rays have no object taken .
open a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . when &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import the scene file and select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the complete command @-@ cat@@ cher of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window appears to list all messages .
if you do not support code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; in order to import objects to the scene , check the code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also insert the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
click Add &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , which opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation of the displayed object . here , place the path to your document and the version . versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported here .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you enter files , which is not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the square for the view pane in the camera view and window type labels .
you can set the points of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wireless set @-@ down menu . you can adjust the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values arise an accurate wire model and therefore a better lamp for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the details level separately for two directions .
when you cross up high detail shots for extended projec@@ tions , all projec@@ tions are used . extended projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
if you are crossing a wall , a wall behind the objects will be rendered . the wall is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern from two adjustable colours .
if you are searching the floor , a floor underneath the objects will be rendered . the floor is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern from two adjustable colours .
if you activate Cant@@ abri@@ an In@@ flu@@ ke , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for the ren@@ dering of scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be adjusted . accurate information about the parameters can be found in section RE@@ N@@ DER modes .
on this page , you can change existing shut@@ ters or create new window orders . in the window direc@@ tives , how to create and store window orders .
the drop @-@ down window system configuration : shows all existing windows regulations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing lin@@ ations shows all existing lin@@ qu@@ ities . a new arrangement can add to the button add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can be added to the button add and select selected views with the button Remove .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with bottom map , you will receive a map card view together with the previous view and the view not ancho@@ red in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start with no more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you can create the ultimate scene in this guide , you should be very popular among beginners : a ball on a plane .
but you should read the following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain that you are only using a black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to the ren@@ dering as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert a light source , your whole scene lies in the dark and you will only get a black image .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window order :
take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation so that you can expect an appropriate performance what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry Edit . so you can now see a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ top view shows how the camera views the whole scene , which you create . in particular , check the scene from the camera &apos;s fourth wire @-@ top view ( see right below ) . this is the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new record with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the content of the object properties properties in which the various parameters of the camera will find . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
do not change anything in the basic settings of the camera , but you can change the camera in view points , with which you can change the camera in view points , with which you can change the focus of the camera . just click on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you are pressing the button or press the space button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree are read@@ mitted accordingly to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could set a Qu@@ ader ( In@@ sert your body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s a comprehen@@ sible method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as bottom :
a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and press the button call or the space bar . in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view also displays the level , although at the moment only as a limited infinite . when you ren@@ ew the scene , the level stret@@ ches out to the horizon .
if you are looking to see the object tree exactly , you will find that you can open the following parameters for each new object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shi@@ fting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the list of object properties .
in this scene , you should get the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , so you can get some of these parameters . choose shi@@ fting and adjust the values as follows :
first select the ground to introduce its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a few times in the moment .
in both cases , a dialog box will open where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select the name in the property tree . you can see the name in the self @-@ view ( name = ground pigment ) , with one click on the button you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pigment only shows a matt black material , because you can still enter the layout of materials at any time with a click on preview . enter the colors for the pigment . also , there are many options again , but now take the easiest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , just click on the button and then call the preview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ ew your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , you are not the Far@@ ben@@ . which you have expected . in the color list , you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal font color and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already simply run this step , because you have already understood the basic working methods of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . put the value for a radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the space or press the button ) , so the ball contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball will float above the ground , since you have shifted the floor for a unit down .
of course , the Ren@@ dering now gives a strange result : as already seen before , the ball out appears like a matt black material . put on the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material as already in the ground , give the ball a pigment than color :
select the first object and change the name for example in ball pigment . click on ball pigment , then select insert and set the values like this :
but you can get more interesting effects when taking time to adjust some finish characteristics :
then change the values like in the following screen shots and click on Apply button or press the space bar .
the settings brightness and reflection are already visible in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what ways you can &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much , which you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a RE@@ N@@ DER method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ dering hypo@@ thet@@ ical rays comes from the perspective of the viewer . the RE@@ N@@ DER is calculated and has broken the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as an atmosph@@ eric effects , such as ne@@ b@@ ula . so , the scene is adapted for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will not see a camera without watching the camera . without a light source you see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in default file dialog you can select a file you have previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
always open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it &apos;s stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes have been rejected since the last time .
you can only select this menu entry if you don &apos;t have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last reverse order . this menu entry you can only select if you use editing pane .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing configuration .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to produce rough surfaces without changing any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it &apos;s common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for texture map .
basic body is simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens of or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object colour to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser which you can select images for viewing .
pictures can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return button .
you can adjust whether every image will be displayed in a separate window , or if all the images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . if a matching fil@@ ename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and Sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the work of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two others , Short@@ cuts for the browser and Short@@ cuts for the browser , the key short@@ cut can be specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background colour . the default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , the next picture is enabled , while you can see the current picture in the folder while you select the next picture , and it &apos;s especially suitable for a slideshow .
this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when referring the name of the last open folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show begins this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so up that only some of the file types will be shown , which may also display the program .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen . this option is enabled by default .
specify if the slideshow should start with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the interval between the change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of rep@@ et@@ itions is set to 0 , the slide show is set to 0 , until it is canc@@ eled by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
click here to change the short@@ cut for the various business cards of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the card slot for the display windows and Short@@ cuts for the browser .
with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the file system with file folders and files in a window .

in the area of exposure Indi@@ cat@@ ors you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator was chosen . you should display colors with what you are supposed to display in contrast . sub@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and expos@@ ing a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions to the selected images . you can also view this in which you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a single application to scan images that do not make more than pictures to scan and send out .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that do not make more than pictures to scan and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save a dialog for storing or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures before storing it .
you can check the status of your scanner at the s@@ ane project page by selecting the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projection ect@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with command ski@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in the terminal , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not concerned .
in order to can@@ can one picture , the user can only start a sc@@ oop and then scan the scanning range for the final scan . the Vor@@ sch@@ aus@@ can is started by the preview button .
to improve the image better , the user can zoom in the image and out of the current selection out . it can also adjust the zoom as well that the complete preview can be displayed in the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read by the scan button .
when saving a preview show in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below , when saving is pressed , then the image will be stored and sch@@ lie ? EN leads to a break and you will return to the main window .
by button Settings you will open the same named dialog in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , to save before saving . in this case , the option has to display a preview . if this preview can &apos;t be requested , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way how &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images stores the dialog box . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite will open the dialog in front of each image , then you will need to save them with a generic name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without a file name .
this setting defines what the images are stored in the config option without using a fil@@ ename . if the images are stored according to any scan , this folder will be used as standard for saving dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically save images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for storing . the automatically stored picture gets a numerical suff@@ ix of any time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can customize to store the image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button help leaves the K@@ DE line with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button opens the K@@ DE over dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; button Settings shows the dialog for Settings and Connect can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used to set up a list of the short@@ cut and their function . here , you can set up a list of these short@@ cut and their function . you can set up a list of the mouse button in the player window and select the Global Keyboard . click on the right mouse button in the Player window and select Short@@ cuts ... select .
you might need to set up existing multimedia keys so that it will work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; dumb@@ bells are working . this way , you make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Center .
Amar@@ o@@ &apos;s D@@ CO@@ P interface has many general functions , which are usually used in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts , and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function can look &amp; b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to Amar@@ ok , Amar@@ ok also has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed due to a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog , with the user to know why a script does not run .
start of the &quot; Cor@@ und@@ um &quot; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the scripts of scripts / templates you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can easily find it as a basis for your own scripts . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ o@@ ok and manage Amar@@ o@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each K@@ DE installation should be attached .
most of the script languages may enable remote control of external programs and commands . usually , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is used in this way . here is an example of Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason scripts can continuously monitor their standard input and respond to events . of course , a script can ignore the events as well .
configure Weber &apos;s script to view the setup dialog . to store the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ ok sets the folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script might now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P features more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ disk signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integer values between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ izing menu subscri@@ ptions : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le &#93; contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu can also be found . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script script d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script post@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before and Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ated or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to complete , e.g. clean @-@ up work . for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok@@ s script administration can also install the script packages that can be downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be seen with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which allows the user to clearly recognize the archive with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , so the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension of amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining memory modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and mount the link to the wi@@ i scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ o@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player für &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and still is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily drag the music in the playlist rather than you need to work through endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting browser and the quick release you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the play@@ lists browser is just right for you . and if your choice is still difficult , choose the dynamic mode and the intelligent playlist will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used as you can listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ discover your music !
normally you have to enter and install Amar@@ ok in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ o@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not comp@@ ile any difficulties if you encounter problems , please tell them in the &amp; k@@ de ; Mail@@ ing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; as most applications have several options to activate or disable the compilation time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
certain depen@@ den@@ cies must be met for some of the compilation options , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section .
activated de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should be full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
Player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed .
use voice activity : this function is only available if it has Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option switches the experimental function of the mood .
setting up : this function is only available if it has Amar@@ ok ; it has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thereby the used color scheme is changed for the mood of the mood .
specify voice files in the music files : this function is only available if enabled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on the storage location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / etc .
external browser : allows you to select the browser by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if a browser is needed .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
playlist by moving , stores the current playlist automatically when referring to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; activate this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist .
relative paths for manually stored playlist : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , out@@ going from the memory location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored .
current piece can be visible when the play@@ lists window causes the play@@ lists window , to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
when switching to the context of the context , automatically displays the context of the context , as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can customize and customize the appearance . the section is sub@@ section in three parts .
in the fonts section , you can select the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select fonts for the following areas : play@@ lists windows , player window and context browsers . press on select ... so you can choose a font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme you can define the tor@@ so of choice and can specify a color scheme . for this , use the color selection for front and background colour .
playback on the start results , that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; after program launch , playback was automatically set up with the piece on the spot , with which they have stopped at last end .
the on @-@ screen display window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog you select the font color for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow can be displayed in the O@@ SD .
our own colors will give you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color button opens the dialog for color selection . if your colors are not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the input box display shows the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by inser@@ ting plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available space holder and what it means .
the screen is intended for X@@ inde@@ ama users . so you can define on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers activate additional settings in this card card .
the card collection will be used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for collection .
here you can select the folders that you want to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section contains also check boxes for inser@@ ting how to use the selected folders .
sub@@ titled sub@@ folder : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the re @-@ crossed and their sub@@ folder to search for music .
change changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary modifications to your collection .
play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection command ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part of the Collec@@ ting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , you will need to set up the MySQL setup .
the MySQL database server is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it is used to enter the database on which the MySQL database is set . after that , the database port is entered , under which the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use user name : and password : to specify the data needed for the connection to the database .
the card last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m a . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations concerning the current part .
here , enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the split pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar perform@@ ers call : after activation this setting is retri@@ eved &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters on each piece played . note : you can use the list in the context browser . note : you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok does not need the k@@ deli@@ bs package so otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included programs , for example , or Amar@@ o@@ ok ; we have written some of it , for example modules or scripts ) . we &apos;ve compiled a small guide on how to get k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions like e.g. O@@ SD sets the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will not work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will be ready for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will perform an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can view the file off the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and then hang on this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and then hang on the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and let the collection rest@@ art again .
suppose that Tag@@ li@@ ad is important for reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report these errors to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it &apos;s a bit mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if , e. g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this leads to the editing of met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , then disable the machine . if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens onto a crash ) . if it is a commonly occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many program data as UTF @-@ 8 can write in met@@ a @-@ info , but not as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; file does not exist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; error while writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be re @-@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s are always active in the status bar ( Rand@@ om smo@@ ker / rep@@ et@@ ition / Dynam@@ o playlist ) . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the status information on grey and semi transparent . please note that in some cases , you can click on a symbol up to three times in some cases .
if you get this mistake : amar@@ oc@@ app : icon look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ x@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be displayed with ld@@ d &apos; , amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you might need to remove any col@@ li@@ on@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust that Amar@@ ok first finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems clari@@ fy on the easiest way by experts in their Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please enter there only one error if something is located on the correction of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; only a single playlist . how do you come to music ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left side and open the file folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start@@ up window was converted into the statist@@ ic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for ass@@ essing the users while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate the pieces , in the playlist , the evaluation column should be displayed . click anywhere in the new selection box to specify the rating for one piece . here you can also use the Short@@ falls Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the pull @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there exactly as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the tool bar of the playlist , directly next to the add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click on it .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el is missing to you . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and re@@ install Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new . look again to lib@@ ary , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the Equalizer can be found in the context menu ( accessible via the right button of the mouse ) . in addition , you can find it by the menu bar in the ex@@ tras ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one of the back@@ end independent base , therefore the actual question is supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty much every conc@@ ei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may be ! perhaps you will use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux which will not be supplied in default ( for pat@@ ent@@ ate reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input bar
launch the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the g@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mixer . it can be used to use audio mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. oss@@ ner ) .
this doesn &apos;t do that media should be de@@ coding . you do not forget to send the media first . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you want a decoder with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can yield directly to AL@@ SA exactly as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . check the Sound server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ iti@@ veness ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ e@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s to create a styl@@ ed play . read this bug report . the sound of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you .
either do you use the Arts drivers , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ t _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller buff@@ al@@ s.@@ yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stream Dri@@ vers , crash@@ es &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . register G@@ ST @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg files , comp@@ ile and install it . then you can then delete G@@ ST @-@ files ( you can find the module file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please tell them below bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ . if you have a whole list of proposals / wishes , send them the best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

the playlist by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the wid@@ est play@@ lists of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many functions that are in no other player . however , you cannot shake off from the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right , the playlist is easy to use , and even for advanced users .
the context @-@ browser doesn &apos;t show various information regarding the current part . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows are later recovered in detail .
if you already have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may have shown that the sub@@ windows start@@ up . the information displayed there are now available in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; besides , information can be collected in the statistical window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music menu provides information about the just running piece , and the musicians and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window will show information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpre@@ t and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to im@@ itate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z Database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information on the current piece . watch here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its evaluation .
to view cover pictures in the context of your context , the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece . the images can also display any name , but images with the word front in names are preferred . the context menu will also display cover pictures , which are either embedded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next area , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be instantly played .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this performer . this area displays the five highest rated pieces of the current perform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can adjust which information can be displayed in the music window . with the right mouse button , click anywhere in the bottom window and select from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last range , albums of the performer , list all albums of the current performer , which you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you &apos;ll see the content of the album .
you can click all the pieces in the individual areas to start immediately with playback . you can also click on the right button on it and then choose from the context menu one of the possibilities to add the piece or album to the playlist .
in the sub@@ menu text , the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites . as soon as you click on the text box , you can download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script runs , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit menu makes it possible to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it &apos;s no running text script needed .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing perform@@ ers - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or gen@@ res are left out there .
group@@ ing perform@@ ers / album - First , the pieces will be arranged according to the album . if you want to see a further distribution according to their album , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below various artists .
group@@ ing perform@@ ers / year - album - Sort by interpre@@ t and then after the year of album in desc@@ ending order ( the latest ) . if the year is unknown , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection will be alphabet@@ ically sorted by each other . the interpre@@ t will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / perform@@ ers - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them to artists .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpre@@ ter .
with the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at your choice .
with the last button you can change the settings for collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will change your collection automatically as soon as you own something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the tool bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves right in the list view as well as in the tree view . references to use this movie can be found in the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a drop down menu , with its help you can filter the last@@ ly added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different time windows from the last 24 hours to a year . besides , you can also select your total collection so that the filter is practically shut off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you get the following options .
loading - This is the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the current order to play .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double click on an entry , you can reach the same effect .
set the pieces in queu@@ e - this function adds the selected pieces into the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
as playlist , save the selected pieces as playlist . they are asked for a name to be stored under the list .
transfer to Media Player - Add the tracks into the queu@@ e to transfer to the media player . more details will be found in the Media Player browser section .
all pieces of this interpre@@ ter burn and burn to CD - Therefore , the selected pieces will burn to K@@ 3@@ b and burn either as data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be shown .
metadata ( for n pieces ) - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Apply files to the tr@@ ash@@ can ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a compilation called the selected album as a compilation , where it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
change a compilation selection - Change the record mark@@ eted album back into a normal album . then the album will no longer be displayed under the associated interpre@@ ters .
the play@@ lists browser is quite easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist page contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection which have never been played .
even even intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click on smart play@@ lists to open the dialog for creating a new intelligent playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ menu media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you have to go into / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ; if you have to use Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ; you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the playlist and drop them on the list . if the transfer is complete , you &apos;ll end the pieces on your iPod . when the transfer is complete , you &apos;ll end the drive train for your iPod .
under the tool bar , there is a search area where you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you can get a address box , with which you can get music from a given URL . if you like for example , tar : / home / mi@@ ke / music .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z can now access to music in the file . you can now let the music from there enter the playlist and let it drop .
if the playlist is more than in the window , the tra@@ ilers of files can be very difficult . in the case , the drop @-@ up of the Shift key can be helpful : in this case , dropped files will be inserted at the end of the list , and not at the base position .
the playlist can be loaded all of you to the play@@ lists . you can enter the order by entering the mouse to the desired position and drop out . over the playlist , you will only enter the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the way back , until the text box is empty again .
if you enter separate search terms and search by spaces ; search for entries , search for entries , search all entries , will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you are searching for entries , search for entries , containing either the one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found which contain one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you are looking for entries to search for entries , then join the search term with ge@@ ese : Mike Old@@ field . after entries are searched for entries , not as Mike Old@@ field , but for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or small . for example : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you are looking for a piece that does not include a specific keyword , sign a minus sign before the keyword : -@@ some searches for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations following each other . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is looking for all things that either Mike Old@@ field included , or having a higher rating than 50 and not the comment bath included .
you can specify the query string of entries by press the CTR@@ L key , and then with the right button of mouse click on the entries you will receive a mark with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played .
the tool bar of the playlist is located at the bottom edge of the window . you can add buttons for some functions of the playlist . at the left side you can find the playlist to save , playlist and pr@@ one mut@@ ates .
next , the buttons are back and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore any changes to the playlist .
in the centre of the tool bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the collection rate can be set with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool bar is menu . he opens the same menu as you see in the Player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are still many other buttons available for tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ aming and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and select tool bar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the play time of all pieces . besides , the status for random mode and playback is easy to change by using the mouse twice in the respective display area .
you can also de@@ activate the status bar . then disable the flag bar in general settings .
the context menu can be accessed by a click with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking the playlist to menu . via this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alis@@ ations plug@@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover pictures . you can launch it by selecting actions in your collection browser .
the cover management contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can select all the albums of a performer in your collection by choosing the Interpre@@ t on the left side .
with the View menu you can choose which should be displayed in the cover management . choose from :
the queu@@ e administration received your big entrance in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control of the playlist . this number represents the order in which you play a number next to the title . this number represents the order , in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
to manage the queu@@ e in the queu@@ e , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also add the pieces in the playlist and select the context menu in the playlist . then you can change the pieces in the queu@@ e .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details of this follow later ) .

&amp; C@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program is burning audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one pass ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text format of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; has all functions that also choose &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually cho@@ oses &amp; cd@@ record ; usually , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality while bran@@ ded audio CDs .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for handling audio streaming . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder @-@ modules .
mad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers of layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
LA@@ ME : a widely developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . LA@@ ME is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FLA@@ C decoder module and an external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to dec@@ ryp@@ t WMA files to burn to an audio CD burning .
So@@ x : a program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio Encoder Module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully featured car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , to create , mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections , can result in the different recording level of the various albums , which can be played differently according to sound levels .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : it is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically play all videos in the base file of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ load recently opened projects . the related sub@@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be asked , otherwise a new file name is asked .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folders and fil@@ ename for the project file .
stores all open projects . that is the same as if you would save data for every single project .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and has not been saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what had to happen . you can then break between Save and Chang@@ es . you can also break between Save and Modi@@ fy the project .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any stored project , which should be done as if you are running for every project file .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , what should happen to happen if you have entered file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select from the appearing dialog files to add to the project . if the current project is a data CD , the current project will appear in the base file of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; open the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , allowing for burning the medium . burning dialog can only be opened when the project contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can change many projects related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What &apos;s that ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only be included in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you are not using this function , so that you can see the files already available in the medium , so that you can see the files already available in the medium .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project will be removed . all other files don &apos;t remove files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD . alternatively , you can also use cl@@ oning if you want to copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also make use of a DVD to another medium . in addition , you can also use a copy of a DVD by copying / c@@ ops of a DVD with the help of copying files . in addition , the target medium has to be big enough to absor@@ b the entire ( vide@@ ot@@ ape ) data from the source media in the original form .
open the dialog for Del@@ ete a CD @-@ RW . so you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format that &apos;s deleted completely by the contents . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose the choice between writing modes and incre@@ mental .
a previous CD image is burning before . the dialog asks you to burn * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported but you need other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
a previous DVD image is burning before . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source that can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously announced DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears to be used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , body settings and even options for changing the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the pic@@ kl@@ ed medium . this information is shown in the content view , and include features of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom edge of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
to@@ g@@ gles the folder view or folder view . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , there will also be a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and unlock the drive or exit of the medium .
switches the content view or off . the content view allows selecting and pulling the files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head of the head view is a narrow range , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head of the project has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key direc@@ tives for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands selected in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment .
this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . therefore , system administ@@ rators are needed , therefore system administ@@ rators are needed , therefore you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you can use general program settings . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you should work immediately . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and for fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in scope of functions , so it &apos;s rather your taste and the type of task that you teach you .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make sure you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; start to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then give something like the following in the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program mixed , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features to create new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project approach , one can receive a project for the new project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can obtain a project about the command line : # K@@ 3@@ b -@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ j@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ j@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ j@@ ect@@ interface that can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
for cre@@ amy folder ( Q@@ String nick@@ name ) , cre@@ ate@@ following ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String parent ) , add@@ ur@@ anium ( K@@ URL : : List URLs , Q@@ String parent ) , remo@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) . ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) , Q@@ String ( Q@@ String ) , Q@@ String ( Name ) and offset sp@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String ) )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then add files into the new folder :

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ j ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Excellent for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data into WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many co @-@ files that these WAV files will need to be installed as from the Linux distribution ( if they have been installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD are read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
are in a second step of these WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading out &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre ( for OGG ) or other enco@@ ders have already been installed , so it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile it yourself . however , it is not necessary to install anything itself . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which code reader / file format will be used ? the book Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction to the encoder , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is not provided to cra@@ ck the audio data ; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection . if not , you can avoid the copy of copying protection . avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while arran@@ ging only one time ( the setup dialog has to be performed so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , after a suitable configuration , it will be explained to the comprehen@@ sion of a single &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble on the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which codes are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from Free@@ D@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a brief list of the main window commands . on the page step by step , further information , such as this program will be used as well as wallpaper photos with descriptions of the program .
the CD@@ DB application on the CD data is set up on request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . )
starts reading and - if a encoder was configured in the Settings tab in the Settings icon - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so the selection can be read with any other encoder than the default . it is to be aware that the encoder was configured in the Settings dialog in Settings dialog .
opens the file manager so that a read file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the kind of messages ( such as protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; end ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; with different card cards ( like Encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . you must go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes key quality , encoding and compression rati@@ os and helps with choosing the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG likes today a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences will generate much less important , as both enco@@ ders are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but no open license issues
+ high up to very high sound quality ( for high bit rates ) , but compared to OGG mild quality in deeper bit rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG billing is available .
MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard@@ disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR Joint Stereo , compression rate about 11.@@ 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a track . good pleasure for music by yo@@ ungst@@ ers , portable devices and auto@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ ds . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely don &apos;t want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that can be entered manually or exported by the program automatically from Free@@ D@@ b via the Internet , are available as a list of parameters . you can transfer / used to create folders and file names as well as the features of the music files .
in connection with co @-@ programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or assistance to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title ; if MP@@ 3@@ s can be coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ res must be added ; the result looks as follows : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; parameters which can be used ( = button labelling in assist@@ ants ) :
this is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : to read / enter the audio CDs that you can download / enter the information , so that all others can download it instead of yourself in the calcul@@ ator . it is to be aware that only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the u@@ ber@@ ship ) : it &apos;s not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no one or less worth@@ less , so the information can be added to the music company damage . all information can be used anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; it is active a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of Free@@ D@@ b , it can be used with another ( f@@ ake ) address as the system used in the system . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used by calling the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . when using Free@@ D@@ b , the ge@@ ographic column should be used to use Free@@ D@@ b . this saves a bandwidth in the network and re@@ sembles the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org offers a current list of refle@@ ctions for the online delivery of &amp; CD ; you can download the complete database , or ( usually monthly created ) only the updates of the database .
which reader program is used to save pieces from CD &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to do it , search in the source code .... It was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this has not been done yet .
to store the selected WAV files , the encoding and the desired file format can be selected . when opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab card to set up the code . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the code package must be installed from the Linux distribution to be installed before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . further information on Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the section Wel@@ fare Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many reasons . check the device name for the CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) , try to run both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could be a clu@@ e on what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still un@@ sure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will make enough information to set up those areas which you want to do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to create everything and our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample words ( tags ) .
it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages to your Linux distribution . at least , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd contains and that you have scre@@ aming on it ( eg ; by copying something into the con@@ jun@@ c@@ or ) .
the first section covers basic configuration of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; something which is probably being done only once and
the second section describes the advance to read a &amp; CD ; what is to be repeated for each issu@@ ing &amp; CD ;
here we determine the using code for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 @-@ 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the program running Free@@ D@@ b to download the CD &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with any issue of a &amp; CD ; change if the matching settings are found .
the device name is delivered to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link on the real device name of your disk . if this doesn &apos;t work or if more than one CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed , so helps a view to the file / etc / f@@ stick and an attempt to use there available entries for CD @-@ ROM and / or DVD drives .
the card General Settings . there &apos;s no much to do . here you can specify an additional conversion . in our example , everything will be shown so c@@ low@@ down / typ@@ ed as shown in screen shot .
only in case of incomplete information , so you will be informed if data are missing to test@@ ify to keywords ( tags ) .
the card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and allow the &amp; CD ; data will be automatically downloaded via the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b machine .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet , so he can access the Free@@ D@@ b server .
the second drop down is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are un@@ happy with the database record and the resulting directory names / fil@@ ename or tag records , they can easily change . the directory or fil@@ ename is changed with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter all manually , select the selection box and Free@@ D@@ b will not use it . however , this is more than 620 MB large , it is worth considering whether this is worthwhile to use it . at least the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . this is Settings for the Data In@@ quiry , For the Call of the Free@@ D@@ b Server via the Internet . how does the system know which data will be received via Free@@ D@@ b . read the section about Free@@ D@@ b . do everything as shown in screen shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and looking to a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load will be distributed between the computers . however , this setting will work as the first try .
both work equivalent to the server , but there are more luck with the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ D@@ b server . the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from screen shot . ( make sure that folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously ir@@ regul@@ ating pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time when using only an existing drive ? does not know the author , so it &apos;s just trying .
CD ; after reading out the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
custom folder for temporary files : if you are crossing the folder , then the path / folder can be specified when only space on another drive is available . if the field is not checked , the files will not be checked if you want to do this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
everything as shown on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under any circumstances have to be bl@@ inded to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned earlier , it is sufficient for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is approximately 224 @-@ 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the reached compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage usage .
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted if needed . in the event of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in screen shot . some comments for future use just outside of this example :
number of simultaneously coded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad @-@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , more than one WAV file can be de@@ code simultaneously .
this is what we have just finished the basic furnishings of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading a &amp; CD ; if you have smart the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section , as the process of reading the &amp; CD is described , we have created MP3 files . the folder structure is based on the Internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ D@@ b is going to be picked up . the process of which is described in this section has to be repeated for each issu@@ ing &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
since we have a &amp; CD ; you don &apos;t have a little bit different than that for one &amp; CD ; with successfully out of Free@@ D@@ b . so you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of access@@ ing them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; you can find this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not been done , now the &amp; CD has to be put into the drive window , which has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in screen shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identi@@ fies and can be read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done then you are searching for questions and answers by help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully by the Free@@ D@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there &apos;s a window appears , and you can select the database entry that fits best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query by Free@@ D@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; ) you can also choose this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but you will need the internet connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot , the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Current titles &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for each comments on ini@@ di@@ vin@@ ell per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the Free@@ D@@ b data , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD @-@ editor , so you can not only check with the artist and album names ( for example whether all words are beginning with big letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; maximum allowed . this option will have a look at the Tab &apos;s Settings section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be supported by all codes or file formats . check in the aid to the Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to obtain more information .
simply select one entry , which obviously inci@@ de with the style of out@@ going CD ; this is not important as we give the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Edit@@ ors will be back again and you will see that the fields for the album are already recorded with the entered data , which we have entered for the first piece . simply enter the items of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the part list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected will be read out . just a simple click on the line switches or use the button to select all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection out the reading process , this window appears to be confirmed . then click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and how it runs out .
click on the tab on the tab on the job window . it &apos;s in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer , which you have not installed yet . pieces that were not successful with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list are marked .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target file are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you tested if you have typ@@ ing on the folders for temporary files and the target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 in the format MP3 . therefore , read and code in parallel . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behaviour . the only thing that seems configurable using the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the used calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem during simultaneous reading and encoding ( of however , two different parts ) .
now the last title is read while a different piece is coded and a third order in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the encoding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; today , if you get familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy here . most distri@@ butions do not contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is already a pre @-@ compiled package . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is aimed at people whose source files are compiled and not designed for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are searching for help as the program can be customized to fit your needs , then this is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best , read the step by step example of the options and settings . it shows photos of the various maps of the settings and includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still am reading right ? even if only the help menu has been clicked on the first time off the program , no audio CD from this program ( especially if at the time of the program starts any audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no E @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t stop this hand@@ book . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ at ; may it do . at least the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion .
strange if we managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; K@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides other he has real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke playback of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX and MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it relies on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support act on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing colour , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of every MIDI channel through emphasis of the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop allowing you to drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows to drag on K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or texture ) . K@@ Mid automatically evalu@@ ates the method used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; end up a song while playing a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , whose help you can select the required song .
you can also send a file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows let it also work with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in tool@@ bar , select the entry down from the menu item or activate the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several tracks , they will be added to a collection and then play back afterwards . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; you play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle button and proceed to the regulator .
if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click the arrows on the left and right of speed change . to get the original pace , double click on the speed LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu piece , thus breaks the playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ ei@@ ps , others use Lie@@ dt@@ ter@@ rest@@ an and again other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust that events are supposed to be displayed automatically and even better : the Event ni@@ p is automatically determined that you have to manually set a song , so you can &apos;t change anything manually . but if you have the option to change this file , you will still have the opportunity to change this when you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , choose from the menu settings the entries of text events or song events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are played by the series . in this section , you can use the collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find in the menu collection under the Point Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then the name for the new collection . this collection will be included at the beginning the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the def@@ endants at the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when applying the application this collection is not stored . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to add a song in the collection manager . there , in turn , you can add a song by using the button . it will appear in turn you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection , a piece will be added when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) to the active collection .
when upgra@@ ding to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece is activated and emp@@ tied the temporary collection , the collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must select the collection manager , select the collection and the required song and then click Rem@@ ov@@ ing .
you can select the order in which the songs are played out . if you select the series after playing the menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be specified .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list on the Karaoke text .
to continue to jump a song , choose the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow button right .
to reverse a song to jump back , select the button previous piece , the entry predicted piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection of the collection and click the button .
temporary collection can &apos;t be dropped . however , this doesn &apos;t matter as it does not appear when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it &apos;s not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events in events that the syn@@ thesizer under@@ stands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thereby can be played a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no software to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications of playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP message , which may appear as often as desired . but it is necessary that each occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; assist you for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , the patches from General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that GM cartridge will not change in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that you don &apos;t need to play on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which is like a gun shot . to do so , do the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP message :
so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( fabric shooting down ) , it takes you patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the concept drum @-@ patch of the patch is meant , for each note a different type of perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ists ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) is not the one that means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some keyboards have it ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a given channel or instrument .
as in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP message , the sequence of lines is very important , as their presence . you have to generate 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key maps are mainly used to form notes on the per@@ kus@@ sions channel . look at the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to transfer some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , make it easy for CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have percussion on a given channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP message has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , you will need to use the keyword name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this canal . in this case , always Patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ ver@@ sions patch on the per@@ kus@@ y channel .
the value for P@@ itch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Ratio indicates the value of P@@ itch ben@@ der events . if so , a MIDI file is converted with the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the Map file will not be dec@@ imal ( dec@@ imal ) .
this setting is needed because GM will be used to play a keyboard , which will play a tone higher with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a tone higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find them in the menu on Settings , Point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole number of cla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this manual , you see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a given channel . for each channel there is a select list where you have changed a tool , the button is no longer green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views , in order to view the played tones below the point can@@ al@@ view : settings
the temp@@ o @-@ LCD shows the speed in which a song is played , the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a music piece . it contains notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to be very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t vibr@@ ate , &amp; k@@ mid ; however , a typical MIDI file needs approx . 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not desire to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
enable the automatic add to the collection before adding . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can double @-@ click the arrow keys from the speed button to slow the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; desktop with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I must play when the collection should be played at the end or I want to play a file simply into the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window , and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn the automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection of opening files .
for example , suppose you have to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. . just imagine the automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard I anim@@ ates that , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my Hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a little time . as Hob@@ bies have programming , MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download the MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you are simply happy to make me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have sound card , you &apos;ll need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; if you don &apos;t have sound card using the MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VI@@ SU@@ AL . if you don &apos;t have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .

&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play files from M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; has not yet been finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed if information is displayed in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to send the preferred links below the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category of continuous playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ arch@@ ical level . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category is copied and the play begins with the wrong entry .
the categories &apos; updates s &apos; , television and long play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it by using a editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML contents of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to be selected from the menu , select the playlist , or select another category .
all changes are lost when working mode left or another group is selected without the playlist .
as a result of the ease of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation starting with start and finish can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation will not need short , it will be automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ ted by opening an other source , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ ated ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &apos; in@@ defin@@ ite ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ ly ; &amp; gt ; / h ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; / / ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path runs from the M@@ Player and the cache size of data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the issue of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special reason for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages it is possible to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the settings dialog by K@@ DE .
the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a consoles to start and search error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if no error occur here is the back@@ end output within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order to always use a given baking dish for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ eme should play on all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards either by using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , the device can be used to use the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , from which one is selected . ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB input .
since the V@@ DR includes support of k@@ m@@ player only X@@ video , X@@ video should also work ( probably this type of playing video equipment under Linux is the only that works ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to work for the X server . therefore , this is why the video file must contain the following configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally they are used by KM@@ players for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ al , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , source source , source source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ ex@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
are there indications such as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after joining the device . it is absolutely certain to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom will be shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ led k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last stored value , only the first time will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + creating graphical user interfaces and network support and will be used to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ;
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional translation application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it will probably be taken back to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or t@@ et@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Distribution included . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD are used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions , enabling easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; -@@ website included .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - independently of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users can hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions about the documentation should be considered . if the support for this project or documentation should be made , the contact about the k@@ ile ; -@@ website must be made .
step up or at comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; attached to or extensions , this should be addressed at the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; - environment for use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; - programs . furthermore , offers the possibility to use , comp@@ iling and consider@@ ations for this . conclu@@ ding , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn more about Kate and its possibilities to learn the manual of Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter of &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right equipment : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . how to use is the found@@ ational &amp; tex ; easy to use , can also use a wh@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; macro to use a less demanding but realistic nar@@ ro@@ unding is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
in addition , here only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given here , it is not the ultimate book . for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. DA@@ LY , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
similarly , as other identification languages contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to with the most general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text @-@ gra@@ dient with the command \ \ &apos; document@@ aries , the mission begins with the command \ \ &apos; begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ Documents { document } .
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful feature for the quick generation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ r ) offers some options for the creation of the document . there are also some of the document related settings .
document classes : hereby , the type of document is weigh@@ ed : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; 2 &#93; &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Pro@@ jec@@ tor &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : hereby the character encoding is set . modern systems are increasingly used to use UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . if UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for the correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this list contains the most often used add @-@ packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they can only be selected in the check box . &quot; &quot; &quot;
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always be used when desig@@ ning German texts .
new users are now not worried . only a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; c@@ ile ; - as well as other source code editor - the emphasis of the used commands , att@@ itudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by contrast , a simple problem is not closed on the screen . however , a simple appearance of the output file has not been closed . however , it is saved by the modest appearance of the output file .
with automatic simpli@@ fication of the environments ( e.g. \ \ ) , { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the added line to the command ( e.g. \ \ by { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in volume settings ; setting up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most abundant and sub@@ marine element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on each side .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI @-@ file is created , ski@@ pping &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle button of the mouse in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the appropriate line at a lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI @-@ file contains a description of the format document and other information such as the font collection and is also available in addition to PDF the available output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for view , transformation and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and services .
when using the cleaning technique , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file is clicked on an element in the DVI and once on an element in the DVI ; file is clicked on the exact opposite . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was clicked on the corresponding spot in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
Master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a Master document , work with other integrated .@@ tex files simpli@@ fies working . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted for project Settings .
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless errors in the source code ) are displayed .
file recovery : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file will be opened onto the surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no appeal by &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes place . after quick installation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when looking at the Edit tool bar , the three large selection box should be developed into the document . the first selection box has been developed for rapid integration of document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The Available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the division are :
the drop down trend is to include articles such as keywords , vehicle notes , or references . these options are :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selecting a selection box ) .
when using quote a list of sel@@ ective entries is displayed . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x files , this works only if the file is needed to create a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ land is used for the definition of the scrip@@ ture and the main text , the fox notes , etc . there are the following texts of the writing :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection options are available : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and fixed settings . 2 . the document can be written by the reason on the basis of the document .
the brackets for the command \ \ &apos; document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this document may also occur in the text .
once the above source code was entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the volume building or a button .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
if the document must be failed , it should be searched for logging levels . when using quick installation , it should be started automatically . if it is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that will be treated differently than the rest of the documents . for example , a report with the font color 12 is created and only a few south @-@ east is to be a different font . the order \ \ sco@@ ops and \ \ VER@@ Y { environment } is to be des@@ i@@ rous of a written form within the vicinity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only within the area ( from \ \ ) , { environment } to \ \ &apos; , { environment } ) , there is no liability ( number ) for the changes within one environment .
there are many options for the ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , toler@@ ances , sau@@ cep@@ tions , etc . must be added to the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ &apos; begin { emp@@ le } : this command is for the short@@ print and is as long as possible until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ t } or any other environment . a single word in one sentence can be ital@@ ic with a \ \ emp@@ le { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quotation in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ assumed { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ &apos; { quot@@ a } .
after writing the sw@@ amp in the sw@@ amp with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language is displayed , then follows a step @-@ step guide on the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the wiz@@ ard a bit text was entered , a few adap@@ t@@ ations for the better legi@@ bility of the document should be performed . at this point a quotation , some places in the fat and c@@ lich@@ é and a poem to use , should be seen in order to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E can be turned back to the Editor ( internal viewing ) . with an external viewer , its windows must be closed .
once the DVI ; file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and fun .
DVI ; is a spacious file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ v ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the readers of some drivers of the computer , there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screen TVs .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - by clicking on DVI , you can print the document by using file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correctly set ) .
the tool bar encouraged the transformation of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion into some formats can begin in the tool bar .
the preferred search encour@@ ages direct jump from the editor to the extended position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; c@@ ile ; provides the appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binding files . only modern under settings must be set up ... tools designed in building .
in order to replace the pre@@ dat@@ or search , the mouse cur@@ sor in one line of the source cont@@ ex@@ ts must be clicked on . the jump to the corresponding spot in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is then performed .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; with one click of the middle button of the key in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; k@@ ile ; attached and to the appropriate line ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; as text editor must be set up ... editor )
should use quick installation of &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer do not allow an error . should a bug be displayed , this is displayed in the logging file or in the news window .
the records file blocks the error source in the source code . in the editor , the pop @-@ file La@@ Te@@ X errors and errors will appear on the errors . the log file must be clicked on the error in order to log the error in the logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the faulty line .
once the button is clicked on the tool@@ bar button appears a window to select the template used for the document . the pre@@ set options are :
for selecting empty document , a document can be re@@ written either from the ground or the assistant for the quick creation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be opened or a new file created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting the file template created by document ...
when creating a new document from a template using file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings C@@ ile ... Settings .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which fonts of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering document world . typically they will be used as following : \ \ &apos; document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the command in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps should be completed : &quot; &quot; &quot;
when creating a new document , the template may be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for , following one on the Internet and the steps described above .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; a text editor for the reading and herr@@ ing of many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for the book &amp; Kate ; can be made directly out of &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn more about Kate , the manual is to be picked up to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found directly with the reading of the chapter by &amp; Kate .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands can be called a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; you have to find a description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with slide button to accommodate the &amp; tex ; which means that in this way click on the \ \ par \ \ Documents \ \ par \ \ par .
when pulling the text with dr@@ illed lin@@ ker , the selected text will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with dr@@ illed switch , long @-@ sided parts of the spring @-@ texts can be selected in the editing window .
&amp; c@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the various types of source tex@@ tures . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are emphas@@ ized by another colour .
many assist@@ ants can include an additional type of book@@ marks within the text . the entries are highlighted within the text . the entries are highlighted in the text or last jumping stamp . this diving stamp is also highlighted , so that it is automatically en@@ listed in the first input of a character .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspects at using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate , have been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; used for many environments and groups and therefore supports many environments and groups and therefore under@@ line the following commands for the text selection :
for a complete paragraph ( batch of lines containing on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning should not include a text with complete lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning in &amp; k@@ ile ; therefore , is that the flows are separated by two empty lines .
use the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an extended meaning , as this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a clean ( * ) command and an additional star ( * ) at the end of the area .
to the place of a part of the document may be removed , and by pressing the key de@@ f . &amp; Kate ; offers the key signature C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . under editing , the following commands are added to the instructions of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit areas of paragraph .
it has already been clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands , under Edit environment , offers a wonderful simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ , { setting } is inj@@ ected at the end of the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of veil@@ ed ambient commands can quickly be lost . this command will close the last environment , so that the sh@@ red@@ ded environment structure is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; c@@ ile ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from Edit surroundings .
with this command will be used to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the wei@@ rd clamp .
with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the pin buck@@ le .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded connection of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when entering a lot of scre@@ ened groups in brackets you can quickly enter the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open group &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this command pin the last open group , so that the put@@ ty structure of the &amp; tex , groups cannot be dist@@ orted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple host@@ esses are used as a reference mark . for the purpose of the beginner , the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the end of the beginner , the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for the end of the beginner , the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for this case , the signs will be used for two purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic configuration of the double beginner can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and will follow .
they can also be used to see specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ig@@ lia or French ) , and with that German or French host@@ esses . there are also many other languages available .
at the dr@@ ation of shift ; space to meet &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not just a hur@@ ry but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close to a tables environment , close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ by a close @-@ sided line breaks off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or Custom environments . these can be added under settings ; setting up ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users have to assign the columns to tables in tables and thereby assign them to each E@@ t @-@ character ( amp ; ) ; seeks to encourage this . although this tab@@ ulator is not to be added to the door , for this tab@@ ulator is not to be added , for some spaces for the table of the current tab@@ ulator .
even though , &amp; Kate ; a good source code for use was built in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to extend special commands ( mostly for a &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) three as needed and the other two are designed for automatic processing . all these modes can be set up for different work@@ pieces under settings C@@ ile ... materials are set .
at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ begin { environment } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added the command \ \ &apos; { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when filling the rings , the last letter of the input will be removed and you can understand it . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are stored by selecting a command . alternatively , a jump to these positions is possible , so that a simply jump to these positions is possible , and the desired parameters can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; set up various settings for these lists . there are different colors lists for these lists ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as sequ@@ el to the general language used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command mode is not given for the completion of environments . it is always used to ensure a large list with environmental consequences . on the other hand , environments are used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; on the other hand , the environments will be used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for author@@ isation of the environments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when calling the complete view mode , the menu click on the complete area or the key means , the command to open the environment automatically , and appears to be \ \ assumed . after that , the environment will continue in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and can only be termin@@ ated by entering the input key .
after this is accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; acknowle@@ dges that it is a first \ \ item command to be filled with .
under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; set up settings for these lists . this mode uses the command @-@ list of the re@@ mun@@ eration mode for the User &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; c@@ ile ; supports custom lists of ab@@ ut@@ ations , which are instantly set up by l@@ Ã ¤ t labels . the lists can be set up in settings . as an example of a shut@@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , is included in the file L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L typ@@ ed the letter L and the word of complete dis@@ mis@@ sal view or the key signature Str@@ g + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste will be replaced , the letter L is replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great authority must not be helpful . however , it has been noted that many wh@@ ites are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; for all the words written already written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can be set up in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings . here also the sw@@ elling value for the display of the adjustment can be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the complete processing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / c@@ ile / ml / c@@ ile / complete / mode / personal / mode / personal / clothing / personal / clothing / personal / mode . mode stands for improvis@@ ation ( down@@ turn ) , Dictionary ( was@@ p ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog graphics form is designed to include graphics as simple as possible . to learn the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and respected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS @-@ files are not as known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for sign@@ age and new arrangements of pages . will the PDF output be re@@ arranged , so you can convert the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools new and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf will be converted to a PDF file .
in order to receive the result of the work , the source code has to be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed in the menus creating comp@@ iling , creating and create view .
for the compilation of the source package for the viewer as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 3 , by pressing alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and by pressing Alt ; 5 the PS file is used .
when using the command , a viewer will normally be called for the comp@@ ile . should not be used an integrated viewer , each new window will be opened every time .
a new project will be submitted to the project ... Hier@@ in will be asked for the following information for this project :
when selecting the file name , the relative path has to be given from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r file extension .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows for the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed in a vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet evol@@ ently developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; nor include .
first of all , the scripts environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile are said ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :

many people often work together in a sort of hier@@ arch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; quantitative assessment ; support team members and this can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Properties dialog .
the name and email records are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identi@@ fying .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team manager and Sub@@ project leaders .
the user can look for himself out of the list of te@@ amm@@ ates that he is . this is done by pressing the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etz@@ e button . the current selected member ( their identification ) appears wis@@ ely after you are : lyrics .
nick@@ names and setting of your own identity are important for messages and comments . see comments on comments .
besides the overview of your team , there is another advantage through the recording of the team members : it can be an event for the information to the team manager , if something is done . see in for further information .
event actions may be promotions , if something specific is happening in the project . an example would be the drawing of the opening and closing of the project , so how much someone is assured , or the sending of a message when a file is assured , or a script that will be added to the CVS if it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page configuration configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address selected in the receiver list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a Team@@ - or Sub@@ project ladder . see in , we@@ i such managers .
remarks are special comments in the documents . they differ by normal comments by following things :
note : you can either choose the editor record from the editor @-@ context menu or read the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by the note text .
comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case the nick@@ name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nick@@ name of the project leader Sub@@ project leader After the range and sub@@ project leaders , should be led in the corresponding unit and sub@@ project leaders , as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of big or small lettering , but space for the cl@@ amps and the box : do the note invalid .
&amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic is supported and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting language .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are covered , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using quantity Quant@@ a ... to be called . alpha dialog covers a few pages which can be treated after one another .
the behavior of &amp; quantitative ; concerning tags including car completion may be changed . the entries are :
large / minimal description of tags : large / small size added to automatically tag tags . tags will be inserted , as described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small description of attributes : large / small size added to SCM attributes . normal large / lower friction means , the attributes are added as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if attached , is optional for tag , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
Un@@ optional tags automatically shut down : as above all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and finish day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding coding during the ti@@ ghtening .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . by pressing the standard , the default filters can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other way as open open files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting is transmitted from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected , but this setting is transmitted from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; created regularly backup copies , so that in a power out@@ age or crash when the next start@@ up of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . this is not a backup regularly , according to the set time , created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or own view ( or the documentation in a box pioneer ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings back to the next start while the user interface is useful when the user interface has changed by changing the MDI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ cks / hin@@ ge from views . it meets the --@@ stress @-@ layout command parameter .
the warning section provides the possibility to deplo@@ y war@@ nings of war@@ nings through h@@ anger from non @-@ en@@ quiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be used to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the syn@@ dic@@ ation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . regards the various modes see .
here is a par@@ ser and the structure of the structure , which represents the figure of Par@@ ser @-@ des in the document , in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse click on the Struc@@ tural tree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following action is possible , which can be solved by clicking on the structure with the mouse buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the field of structural adjustment settings , the visibility of knots on the tree can be opened automatically and how deep in a modification of the structure is to be opened automatically , empty spaces are in the text , whereas blank groups are found in the current document , no element has been found .
the area for laying of Ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded by editing a larger text , each can be divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; this means , it may be a valid group for PHP , which indicates the if@@ cla@@ se abbrevi@@ ation something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications of third page , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , best known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following includes :
address : the path to the Plugin , if it is not in a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is made to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plugin does not deny the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the load when this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct , if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the bug@@ ging was completely revised . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bug@@ gers , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Debug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin implemented , which enables various implementation of plug@@ ins .
currently only a plugin available , support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ anti@@ - l@@ us ; entry .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the following options , beside the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , you can change the specific settings .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the contents of super@@ vised variables . usually appears in the left dock .
a view that lists all holding points , with line numbers and conditions . usually appear in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , produced , or she shares the plugin with , on debit needs . this action is opened by default when a project is opened , which needs a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal case does not have to be observed .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gger session Star@@ ts the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the bre@@ ach according to requirements .
send a HTTP requirement to the server in order to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with using a browser to look the current document . this requirement is displayed in the viewing de@@ bu@@ gger edition .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the exec@@ uting of the script and running information on the monitored variable . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution continues , before a debit requirement has begun , the script will begin using the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script file , without information to super@@ vised variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script has been given , the execution proceeds as soon as a request will start .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script without going into the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger shows the next order in the script , where possible in functions and includes errors .
has the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over and walk to the next , as if there is no current one .
opens a dialog , where a variable or expression can be entered , the monitored value will appear in the variable screen .
with this dialog you can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to adapt to your needs and how to help and qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
document type E@@ diti@@ onn@@ ets ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative ; used to provide support for mark@@ up and scripts . its simplicity and flexibility are made of &amp; quantitative ; you can use &amp; quantitative ; easy , user friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; B &amp; DT@@ EP ; s consists of two parts , the tag folder and tool@@ bar . tag files are handy , symbolic @-@ oriented and instructions faster into a document than one user ever could .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be ordered manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . short , one &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; quantitative ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; itself . tool bar enable a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without a risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the read language and version , so existing . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared if they are necessary , or not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in the individual . everything about the possibilities and limits will be displayed in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type , nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the daily class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type of Method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
yes , if yes , the day has an common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that &apos;s a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . additionally , it specifies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains further tags that should be displayed as this attribute is to be displayed and etc ; This is a only element type element .
are the source code used for filling the attributes in tag editor and in the attribute tree to
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative ; will be used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name within &amp; quant@@ a l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method@@ ology name . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . can be empty or -@@ tag@@ ame % , that means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an only element type element .
specify the position of an attribute of an tags within a dialog box . this day can occur only once in a dialog ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the element is empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in the dialog ( for example one for every &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this element is an only element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files have to begin with a &amp; XML ; declar@@ ing : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly glu@@ ed and closed .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is to be presented above in &amp; quantum le@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; windows to start and checked Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . however , the verification takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ a l@@ us .
following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ ename for this day XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , an example for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP will be described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ loading .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &apos; string &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also pretty simple and there is an editor to access via DT@@ D . with this option di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with following entries are created :
&#91; General &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; quantitative ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D ( / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
a action can be set up with Settings ... Create . click New Action for the same dialog :
this promotion is assigned to the keyboard . by clicking the User Defin@@ ed , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with a button the current short@@ cut is removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the Det@@ ect settings and in the execution of this action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action sty@@ p . using this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it &apos;s not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of document ) . even the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
first you need to specify the script and the interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified pa@@ ws are allowed , it is recommended to find the % scri@@ pt@@ dir . $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / scripts / apps in its path : $ PAT@@ H / share / apps in its path : $ PAT@@ H There are other specific variable , which can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in the event of a local document file file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; only one instance works , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; quantitative ; external script is used .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the included methods , a script can be evaluated by &amp; quant@@ a l@@ us ; at the default input . in the selection box , you can determin@@ ate what is to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected part of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the input , the output of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; application &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output , written to the standard issue ; error messages can be done to the standard issue , by default the value is set out : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the mark@@ er .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select the settings .
the parts of this window are quite self explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the right tool bar .
complete all and , if the day attributes has and you are planning to activate a dialogue &quot; day &quot; when available , so that a input when using this promotion is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should note the action in conjunction with this symbol ? if we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; uses 3@@ x@@ 32 pixel as standard , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 to change this , select Edit sizes .
please note that the created symbol is not only helping you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
with regard that the tag start is called , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ alled , this symbol is a &amp; lt ; starting the day in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and put them away with other tags , so there &apos;s still which , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to tool bar , or it should set this for better overview through some separ@@ ators in several groups . make sure the tool bar is selected among settings . make sure the tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( on top left ) for my tool bar . after choosing the element to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds to the tool bar .
for example , I want to preview quick access to the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add to tool bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar might believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by trying all symbols to make sure everything works .
secure in the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created im@@ bal folder but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder , so that their tool bar ( s ) will be loaded if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the men@@ tion@@ able extension of &amp; quant@@ a l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ ati@@ fication language that you like most . therefore this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could test &amp; qu@@ anti@@ qu@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory if anyone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we &apos;ll need to let the first part we treat you .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ one , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.@@ g . # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 1.@@ html @-@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in documentation . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so much as :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level Elements Top element = PHP 4.2 , # Get@@ ting started , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Introduction , ... Basic syntax = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax = basic syntax = basic syntax .@@ html ...
note the # vor Get@@ ting started and Language Reference . that shows that it is a sub@@ folder in a tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess tel@@ egra@@ ph ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it out .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced to a file ( and consistent on the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ; res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ files will be replaced .
the section of doc@@ r@@ c _ fet@@ ch _ array function is designed for example when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts written for the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function , the documentation should be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connecting lines .
a simple list of two separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of PHP ; ) .
you can now save your file doc@@ r@@ c directly to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quantity / apps for local and global use . then create a folder ( as if you have doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c , and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that this well and worth it is to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation is used to use by the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have been working on the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners , or else who will be sent . at different places , there &apos;s an e @-@ mail menu including DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ D ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archives , from where all other &amp; qu@@ anti@@ us ; -@@ users can download it and only available when our team needs them as correct and useful for publishing , it is guaranteed to make use of a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources guarantees , for our team as well as for future users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have completed multiple keys . in the dialog New Resource , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the Upload will start .
the up@@ loading can also instantly upload the tool@@ bar DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and can be started in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installing , investig@@ ate &amp; qu@@ anti@@ fung@@ us ; in the case of problems , it may be canc@@ eled . if the integrity have been given correctly and the resource is correctly signed , a notification appears with the st@@ ating the author of the resource .
it is possible to work with XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; quantitative assessment ; however , it may be time consuming , because hundreds of day files can be needed in everyday XML format . there &apos;s the easier way to convert DT@@ D automatically into an DT@@ D package .
the transformation can be started from the DT@@ D command and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
objective name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ itions : the string that will appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of DT@@ EP after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; quantitative ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore , one must first create these concepts at first , without their understanding and qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefits brow@@ nish .
in &amp; quantitative assessment , the operating range is divided into three areas : global , local and projection . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone who is qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . from tool bar about actions , everything is marked global , in the joint file structure of &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators different tool@@ bar , actions and samples in the global tree to ensure everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system available .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be all done by &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool bar with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ it the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ ing Pan@@ e , the Bau@@ mania with information and tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for detailed information about these areas .
you can click on the right mouse button , to get an account menu with the current mouse @-@ mouse button , such as close to the current , other or all cart@@ ou@@ tra@@ ps , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS repos@@ it@@ ories to the current document .
right mouse prints lead to a further context menu on the edited documentation , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , processing under the mouse po@@ inter or open the file , if the string indicates a file below the mouse po@@ inter .
at the top of the Edit@@ ing window , the tool bar of the editor will be shown . at present the tool bar is shown as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of tool bar , the tool bar is adapted to the new features and related user needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of tool bar is really light . if they want to insert a single day , e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to insert it into your document , then you can enter the data for this just added day . if you want to insert several attributes such as anchor , you can fill different fields in a dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate to &amp; quantitative ; to navigate , they are able to open and through . in the presentation with flash@@ es , documentation , project templates , documentation , attributes , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quantitative tool . this view shows all files in the project and allows you to remove all files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as removing , removal , up@@ loading or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed cont@@ ex@@ tual menu .
another possibility of qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open .
templates can be divided in three categories , depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the user and templates in projects . more to templates is found in .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of integ@@ rating in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can use the information available to a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script can be started to send or send by email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed on the position of the element . by the Right click of an element it will open a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresh@@ er of the tree .
this tree appears among other buildings . with it man@@ quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . changing the content management system allows the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation for the web technique for your development . there can be pre@@ packaged documentation for &amp; quantitative assessment ; it can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be customized , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ oons at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information system : the mess@@ aging window and the problem window .
this box leader features information about each in Quantum a running script . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this box counter shows all errors in the start@@ up of the current document . &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so that exists ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative ; tool bar is extensive extended and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate @-@ e@@ ite of tool bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed air @-@ archive over &amp; K@@ mail ; if they get a tool bar in an email , they can secure it &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any others secure and charge !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; for this , auto conf gives a number of options that can be handed to the configure script . to understand a complete list of options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
if you &apos;re having trouble when starting &amp; quantitative ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . you should also make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H because of its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative Web development optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide variety of power functions .
during effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ a l@@ us started to deal with a close idea : what if &amp; quantitative ; an independent , ext@@ endable Mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would make it an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done !
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it into &amp; XML ; it should be qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it should be suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to which the above needs must be noted that &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based on why anyone else has developed ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; - odo@@ urs is not just this all possible , it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative ; so to expand as they need for their need .
&amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web development to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can be improved with virtually any task . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted promotions , scripts and tool@@ bar ; you can expand &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us , without any other scrip@@ ting language . ( more about it in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been developed for rapid web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is to help help : / Quant@@ a ( either enter this URL in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or help the help center : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you can open a file that is not found on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for future use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder , only a bug is reported .
converts when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , special characters included , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ att@@ ing assignment .
convert text from clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; - description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . it is primarily used to add &amp; URL to the anchor tag .
switches the block selection or off . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script will be error messages !
seek a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or used with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
evaluation and setting of the problem repor@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure .
displays the symbol column on the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries and next , depending on the cur@@ s@@ ors location in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents will be group@@ ed by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored on the file .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the repository .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . it allows for copying device files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
charges the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded any input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
att@@ itudes such as &amp; quantitative ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quantitative assessment , you can find details .
charges a project tool bar . these are kept in repository / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu , if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens up a dialog to add a new tool bar . this created only the names . actions must be saved through Settings . tool bar are stored by tool@@ bar tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to store the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool bar from the sight . del@@ etes it from disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
in order to send your own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ team , so the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar .
allows up@@ loading of tool bar to the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
charging a &amp; DT@@ D ; you can or anything else made and convert to the &amp; quantitative ; own acc@@ ord format .
loading / re@@ mot@@ ely dischar@@ ged of entities out of the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities out of the &amp; DT@@ D ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not available , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog , when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tag , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific under@@ men@@ tions .
activated / activ@@ ates the intelligent insert of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; quantitative assessment means that this day is contra@@ di@@ cted by means of tool bar .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins listed above listed above listed below . click on a activated plug @-@ in activ@@ ates it .
choose the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available application schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
select the type of line @-@ looking ID . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; tidy by external application tidy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over can sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card display mode , which is also the default value , or the sub@@ menu mode , which is the representation in &amp; quantitative ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . with selecting a job , the corresponding sub@@ windows is activated .
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main window , respectively .
changes in this dialog affects every application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
judge the behavior of the Edit@@ ing window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate . you will find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or which add and change the series .
this should create a help according to the environment &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely liz@@ ed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantum ; -@@ development in financial form , find here the way .
the fields are self explan@@ atory and should be completed the best from above , since example after the execution of the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Properties are being adjusted .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , the file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository .
here you can access the server address of the machine where you want to access , except one processes local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , default settings are used . depending on the setup , it could be necessary to adjust .
this is the folder , where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative Path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be configured instead of the standards .
this is the folder , where the tool bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by standard tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be configured instead of the standard .
this allows to add files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . several files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . at ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go different .
go @-@ in , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is based on new , not an@@ ni@@ ak .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the folder and you can make a precise selection according to coup@@ ons .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by h@@ h@@ aken or , by removing the tick , cl@@ oned out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be uploaded to the menu Properties in the Men@@ üb@@ aum in the menu Profile or using the Shift Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings match those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder ) , which are related to project related operations , such as project folders .
supple@@ mentary option to top , also files which are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view that will be loaded during opening the project . in addition , more about project views can be read .
thus , the required de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be configured using the Options button . in this case the de@@ bu@@ gger can be described .
in the window of profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be configured ( see in ) as well as the display of a tree view for each profile by showing an own tree view for each profile .
in the windows configuration team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as an mailing list . see the details .
in the sub@@ menu event configuration , you can change event actions and add these actions , change or delete actions . event reactions are executed if a particular event occurs , such as the She@@ ets of a file . see in the details .
by default , the qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project , which was open , we can &apos;t influence this behavior .
to open a different project , select the project ... from the Tools menu or the icon Project Open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; quantitative ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management offers free access to the files in the project . there , files can be managed in the current project .
folders can also act , but missing entries open and opening up with ... in the right button of the mouse click on the button menu :
here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will disappear to prevent removing .
the password is kept in the core memory and forget with programming . this possibility is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the record does not save in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name , to which the files will be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will function .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed k@@ io Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this doesn &apos;t have to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service not on the usual port .
depending on your rank@@ shaft , this is either a time saving function or a danger . use it after your discre@@ tion . the password will be stored on the plate , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in plain text .
one project view is just a set of files and tool bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple num@@ b of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the updated files and tool@@ bars .
the views can be stored in the project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ a l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows modification of &amp; quantitative ; to their own working methods .
as already mentioned above , tool bar in &amp; quant@@ a l@@ us ; best on the tool@@ bar menu . use and add @-@ in . the addition of tool bar is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool bar and symbols can be set on either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , a new tool bar can be set to ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars , which can be displayed in the dialog , where actions may be displayed on this or other tool bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will remove action and action are displayed , that are self explan@@ atory .
tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings for tool@@ bars ... and settings can be set .. .
templates are in essential document skel@@ et@@ ons , code schn@@ itz@@ el and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates as a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any existing folder to the system . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations which one imag@@ ines the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative templates ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are normally added in documents using global templates ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be made by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple framework for the purpose and organizes a simple framework to be efficiently . some examples can be found under global templates . see in for more information about templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is added on a template , but the same text area will always be included in the documents by a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the template area under global templates . see in for more information about templates .
as the name says , these templates are for whole websites as templates . you are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder structure . currently there are no examples of qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
create a document structure following you ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As a template to save as local template ...
once that has been done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look under project templates .
select text in your document and click on File As a template to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only in a file folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and inser@@ tion about the file tree of kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files tree view , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be stored in the repository , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can create header lines and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep some things in using projects very deep in mind .
the template structure in the sub@@ menu templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as above .
to specify the behavior of a folder you can click the folder with the right mouse button and to select the properties in context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ inded , as soon as ter@@ restri@@ al attributes is t@@ act .
this is enabled by default and suitable for everything except the regular file . if a regular folder would be adjusted , it would be explicitly activated in this path unless otherwise it would appear as if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably be found in a trunk file .
allow preceding or presented text for templates in this folder . this might be general header and foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents to a folder with special header lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , you have to include Con@@ text menu ( on it , press right mouse button ) to add folders or copy templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which can be accessed via the menu View . the first mode replaces the editor @-@ editor in two parts : the code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it displays a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and when needed to source code editor , in which the changes made in the source code are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , on a document , which contains PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; it is still not possible to change this behavior .
the second mode just works like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are displayed in the code editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor is already active , this mode is already active when pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation interval between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code Editor is adjustable via Settings Quant@@ a .... In choosing V@@ PL ; you can automatically select between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation may be adjusted . basically , the recommendation is : a small range for fast calcul@@ ator and a large range of fi@@ r for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing features can be selected using the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called for the reduction of the suspension code . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document itself , for example , keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of desig@@ ning pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with buttons below the list or delete a change via the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS styl@@ ing by pressing the file button and choose the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is like in a word processing , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by means of return or remo@@ del@@ aste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inser@@ tion of tags will be made in the same way , as in the source code editor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is to be aware that the inser@@ tion of tags in previously existing exact tags cannot be removed , e.g. if a anch@@ ors day , surround with text , each other surrounding tag should be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some tool bar like the tables assistant or the lists can be disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release , the tables or lists of tool bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool designed to study styles . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ list@@ ics , search for specific elements is possible and the design of the style can be prosec@@ uted .

there are many graphics tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions had been made and at the same time changed much text in many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result had numerous conflicts with merge .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places , where perhaps only the change had changed . the result of this change was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; able to display the differences in one line and changes to white characters . later many more useful functions were added later .
if you want to quickly compare text , copy it into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and co @-@ operation of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost a full file browser .
3 @-@ way merge will also be fully supported if two persons can work independently in one piece of co@@ d and make changes in the original file . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the image photo shows three source files at the merge :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to complete and merge to complete folder . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences in terms of present colour monitors . if you often have to review co@@ d , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in some number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the summary on the left side of the column on the left . ( no longer if any one changes the rec@@ ess . )
if a file is equal , and the other one differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ files .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily write the file by using only the fil@@ ename of the first file . example :
sub@@ folder 1 folder 2 sub@@ folder 2 sub@@ folder 2 sub@@ folder 2 sub@@ ner@@ 1 folder 3 folders 3 folder 2 folder folders
opening dialog enables manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ ename , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last open file from the drop @-@ down list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files .
via the button file ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , select the same or merge file , for B and C , select a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
when inter@@ fer@@ ed , the input field is active for target and can be handled . however , it is not necessary to upgrade immediately a output file . you can also get this step later when saving .
the set button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board . the comparison begins immediately . in opening dialog you do not have to select files , you can simply connect the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also drag and drop off : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from a editor and let it fall on a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains a file such as many similar functions . if you &apos;ll need to figure out how similar these functions are , it would only have two relevant files to upload them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can easily copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can remove any material from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the release of text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and lower@@ ing text into another program as out@@ crop and add @-@ in ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such case your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each word window , the information line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C is optional too long ) . ( if the path is too long ) , leave the mouse for a while on the line . then a little relief window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , the default color is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well .
links to the text , the column is displayed . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . among some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line , which separates the merge column from the text , is interrupted at positions where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dot@@ ted on broken lines .
the results window ( in the comparison window ) also has a info line with the inscription : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; read@@ more &#93; when you have finished the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ b@@ anded , saving disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to next dissolved / un@@ occupied conflict for the remaining conflicts to find . )
if only two compar@@ isons are to be used , every difference is also to be manually solved .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group will be shown in all windows , and the first line of the group will be displayed in the windows . ( this is also highlighted by the color background color . ) This group will be highlighted by the color background color for the current section and each on the left will appear black bars .
sometimes there is no further line in the batch by automatic coll@@ ision or by manual editing ; it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case ; it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps to another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , or in a marking which you might copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ ization appears ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . use c@@ auti@@ ously with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignore the Options , ignore or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . when you use in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys on , right , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . in addition , you can also click navig@@ ating to navigate .
in the eye window you can also use the other keys to edit . using the inser@@ tion key , you can switch between plug @-@ in and transfer mode . ( default is plug @-@ in mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section merge and the ed@@ itable output window was declared ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / former conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / Str@@ g picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Figure ) , or to the next / previous conflict , even after manual release , therefore must be classified as conflict between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you have to automatically copy the copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ insert ) . if this option is activated , the option is carefully copied and manual copying . be careful with this option but you could acci@@ dentally write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line inputs are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ in @-@ feed type \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use the line spl@@ itting of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of last files used will automatically be saved during loading and re @-@ established at the next start . ( menu In@@ sert &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a type@@ face with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialogue also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but they should not use it . )
if you enable this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the chosen font is not supported , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered by default . on these systems the button will automatically set up an un@@ just colour .
if this option is activated , when pressing the tab button , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator @-@ character is inserted .
when entering or press Return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line will be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , any choice will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . then manually copy the buffer to the clip@@ board .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
in comparison of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step will not be ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage copy &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; and a line @-@ slide show &apos; \ &apos; . usually , it can store files with different sizes in the page @-@ on page , but then they could be different with different sizes in the page . if this option has to be disabled , this option is de@@ activated . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; -@@ &apos; ) are ignored , but the differences are displayed as white characters .
by default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively looking for smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effectively for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic res@@ ume mode , this setting indicates how long the results of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ occupied conflict is going forward .
automatically solves all the conflicts in white mark by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection ) . if you need this only from time to time , then use the functions W@@ ähle A / B / C for all un@@ conscious white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in the chapter for scanning folders and execute a merge . look for details under documentation to directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and an older version exists , the original version is Suff@@ ix .@@ original file , if already a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original file , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must finish and rest@@ art@@ 3 ; this option is active in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is being globally tuned over the control centre . )
the following coding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if enabled , this option is used to set the top setting for all entries .
about the sel@@ ections for encoding appears a brief reference , which is the local coding . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a pure inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted , as encoding for each file can be individually adjusted , even files with different coding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define prec@@ urs@@ or commands , you may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could handle 16 @-@ bit Unicode . ) With this option one can define the encoding of the issue of processing operations .
switch this off to supp@@ ress the changes of changes in white characters in text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignore or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences between two of three files will be displayed . however , you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . according to selecting from A &amp; lt ; gt ; B , A &amp; B ; gt ; C , A &amp; B ; gt ; C , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; B ; gt ; C is displayed with the required information .
sometimes you would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply browse the less important window . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
arrange the same window by side or each other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to carry out the files . a simple click starts to merge the merge and uses the fil@@ ename of the last source file as default for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge file , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will first be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which means exactly your requirements . for example , you can use this function for instance .
when reading a file it is handed over to this external command . ( see above ) , the output of the command is only used during the line command . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds precisely to your requirements . every input line has to have an associated output line .
the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when set up the di@@ ff results , but most users don &apos;t want to program it . however , good news is that in most cases be used or per@@ l entirely enough .
for example , use this command line command to convert the input string to the input string : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; . the \ \ &apos; s added text converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add bare string files . all following the same pattern to change $ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ _ BAR _ change \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \
while you experiment with sed experiment , you may start to understand and perhaps you may like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a complete processing command for line ab@@ rup@@ tures . ens@@ sed it / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; is a suitable matches , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi @-@ deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several objectives at one time . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the translations from each other . example :
instead of sed you can use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; Aller@@ dings are different with per@@ l some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the prec@@ eded &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for viewing and to merge . the further operations only change the data that the line @-@ ab@@ rup@@ tly @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus seem to be seen .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the Z@@ eil@@ tron pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you cannot notice certain differences or destroy important data in the worst case .
often you need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and combine with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and collapse .
... doing each object a proposal to merge together ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and displays the sim@@ ulated changes without it really ,
... leads to selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files . you just need to specify the folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders can be merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start together , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder you &apos;ll find a little news window about the current progress . if you cancel the file , only the files are listed below .
when the scan of the file is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by using the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory contains two functions . all sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can open all folders .
when you double click a file , the file will start immediately and it appears a comparison window .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the type of file is different in other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case the interaction can not be selected automatically . if the merge will be started again , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their whole content is identical . then , file is the same color . by folders the age is in@@ significant for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colours of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the synchron@@ ize mode is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders were synchron@@ ised , and if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; directories &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option is synchron@@ ised , then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary promotion , so after that both folders are identical . if you have an entry ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user can see only B ) as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders can be merged and select the option of new file instead of merge ( in@@ secure ) then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if the files are different , but the same date will be different , but the date is identical . if such errors cannot be removed , the merge file will not be started .
while the merge will run a file after the others . it displays status column , when the merge result was successful , and according to other messages , when something unexpected was complete , you should change the last review and see whether the status is ok everywhere .
if the settings dialog is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resol@@ ving conflicts is only shown if three folders can be compared or merged . )
you can result in either the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all clas@@ hes actions ( also in all sub@@ missions ) , you can launch the merge .
please note : if you have not given a target folder , then in the three @-@ file merge mode , B will be used as the target for selecting a two @-@ file merge , A and / or B is used as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries must be specified in the folder , too . there are some options by typ@@ ing certain entries . check out these options for un@@ pleasant surprises :
to secure all the entries : select the directory entry / proceed in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) to perform only the current record : select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types exist still invalid , a message appears on the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options guide , Sim@@ ulating and break .
choose Sim@@ ulating if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; then carry specific actions with all entries . if a manual operation is needed ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select / proceed or press F@@ 7 . if you are not saved , an appropriate dialogue appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will proceed with the next entry .
if &amp; Cas@@ ek@@ 3 ; on a mistake , you see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will try to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue to skip the cause of the problem , you will have the opportunity to try out another promotion , or solve the problem in another way before continuing the problem .
if some entries have been compiled individually , re@@ members &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and then carry out all the entries again . even if the merge changes have been reviewed or not saved , these entries will be taken up again .
the Settings menu of &amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ) has now created a section called directory merge with these options :
only files which match the indicated pattern will be displayed in the element tree . a valid plac@@ eholder feature : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value is * . folders do not need to match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the element tree . it can be submitted more than a pattern , using the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the element tree . it can be submitted more than a pattern , using the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS . many autonomous files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be selected specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ esystem a file is selected as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
with links on files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . when the option is enabled , the files will be compared to the links being disabled . this is de@@ activated in default .
in links to folders : when the option is switched off , the links are evaluated as normal folder and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions ) , a link may lead to a junction and dec@@ ryp@@ t and dec@@ ryp@@ t . ) This option is shut down in default .
execute a complete analysis of each file by and displays statistics @-@ columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if they do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , you may compare it faster , only the chan@@ ges@@ et and the file size will cost you a certain level of security . please be careful with caution . please use this option in default .
similar to confi@@ d@@ ment date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered to be identical if you have lost the amend@@ ment date . please use caution when copying the change date . please be careful with caution .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared , and no target folders will be selected . in this mode , the results of the merge file are selected , and the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is displayed in the default settings .
if there are differ@@ ing differences will be proposed by copying the newer file as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , for it is provided that the other file is not changed too . ) This option is checked in default .
if a file or folder will be replaced by another version or deleted , the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original file , this will not only be deleted without any other backup . this option is switched on in the default .
normally , the file merge mode remains visible with the merge of individual files ; you can turn off the window divider with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can turn the menu window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file by using a double @-@ click . however , you can also use a single file directly , without having to save the folder , the status will run properly when you run the file again and the file will not run once again when you start the folder .
however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : read new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open to local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively , or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spac@@ ing &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes , due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . there is a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then , a link will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to process per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , devi@@ ations or change of change from the original . ( note the option confi@@ dential . ) ( This is only possible in local files ) .
the main reason for use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP directly start the built @-@ in differences viewer . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then choose In K@@ diff@@ 3 part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a K@@ Part , it accepts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original file from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch starts to restore the missing file .
in the kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that it does not work if none of the original files exists . also , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file .
if &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; as a part is executed , it supports only the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge operation or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is Com@@ mit ) there is already . also , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can result together as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff @-@ tool collection .
I use GPL programs for a very long time and have learned a lot that I saw in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or would go so .
you probably have compiled the program from the sources and you probably not find the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default setting , configure the resources on / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find further information on this subject .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is identical , the line will be treated as not identical . if it is not identical , if it is not identical to any other , this is this is the K@@ is .
the editor re@@ members any difference in the files where it begins and where he ends . this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design an extra file format that could save this information .
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is l@@ aded ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; published and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does it mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the game Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 functions ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms with no K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes using htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the source package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base file of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are un@@ safe , see further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have problems with comp@@ ile . if difficulties are encounter@@ ed , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt removal ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
note that files are identical in all folders not appear in the file structure , and thus not in target folders .
( in the current version , you have to read the folder with the updates to these options . )
only entries are displayed , the differences will have shown that identical files will not be copied to the target file . if the target file does not contain these files , they are missing after the merge file . ( the behavior will probably be modified in the default version . ) This option is displayed in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . understanding differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ preview of all virtual work areas . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the working areas to finish it or post@@ p@@ one it . this works both within a desktop and with multiple .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even elsewhere .
with the middle button of the mouse , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both within a desktop or other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has added only the two entries , and the name of the application and the name of the application as well as the entries are min@@ ed , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and finish . the commands confirm the following :
maxim@@ izes the use window on the full size of desktop . only appears when it was clicked on a application .
use your application to select the selected Virtual Desktop . only appears when clicking on a application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle button on the desktop and also on other work areas .
if this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual work surfaces are displayed .
enabling this field to display the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual work spaces . it is displayed together with Name , are provided with ordin@@ ated numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , running programs will be displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to allow the selection .
here is the view of the program window . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the window window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; top window can be determined : classic &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in some other window managers , only shows all virtual work areas in a horizontal and vertical series , which is very good for the display at the side of desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display and move the windows as icons or with their content and move it out outside the control bar .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering from the repe@@ al Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain@@ s . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with mouse em@@ ulating . this requires little practice however .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain that comes when clicking the mouse and helps you use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also look at pain , which should be related with your computer , if this is not done yet .
to clear it once : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that will arise when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by moving the mouse , us@@ eless . and , as with all ergonomic tools , the result may differ for each other .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
if the intelligent move is activated , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling in pressed mouse button . the intelligent shi@@ fts requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this we@@ aving time must be stopped after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
if intelligent shift is switched on , the turning point is set ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is adjusted , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after supp@@ ress the mouse button , before the mouse hit the mouse again , if no cause of the mouse is made .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now this function is enabled by clicking on the right and back , followed by a pause , a click on the right button . a click with right mouse button . this movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move the response time to sh@@ orten the response time ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the Sound System and here the rider &apos;s sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation here , to find out how to launch a program automatically .
sets the settings back to the values that were set when opening the dialog . have you already pushed the button , the settings will be reset to the press after pressing the dialog .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with pre@@ ference . in particular the intelligent shi@@ fts should be used first . if you want to get used to the automatic mouse click here , you can later make intelligent shi@@ fts .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to decrease the response times by &amp; k@@ de ; at lengths of sounds necessary .
first , you should feel aware of which positions a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , do not lead to un@@ seas@@ oned reactions . therefore , you can park the mouse to such places until you would like to use them again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse , that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you must take out the mouse ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse different . but it should be clear , if you see the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are attached to the sides of the hole into which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or your fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if just a shift start was started . if you are in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation couldn &apos;t end more by the release of the mouse .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists to carry out a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; restored and you can work as usual .
problem : when you enter text , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool tries to run mouse clicks and put mouse clicks on a different spot .
work@@ around : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor location where you want to make it . so you can use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop . safe zones for the mouse button are &amp; eg ; grey surfaces around the tool bar and menus and the tit@@ lebar of windows .
I try to work with smart shi@@ fts , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent shi@@ fts is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes his time to select it possible to copy it into the clip@@ board and to add it back to the clip@@ board or to add any other promotion , with which you will probably have problems with pressed mouse button . but there will be some advice to them . here are some advice :
do not use smart shi@@ fts , if you just start with it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . select text instead below and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this way , where &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is playing a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when intelligent shi@@ fts start . later , you can also use intelligent shi@@ fts without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test Enlargement for &amp; X Window ; installed . that should be the case in most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button just as soon as the mouse cur@@ s . this program was developed for people who suffer on the RS@@ I syndrome , which prepar@@ es the actu@@ ators of the Mau@@ st@@ ion pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it can also be configured to configure a particular time that a pulling procedure starts before the mouse has started . in this way , pulling and dro@@ pping with your mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the dum@@ b user can let her computer speak for himself .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk show sentences .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command a later used for voice output text . further details will be found in the description of the dial@@ ogs .
on the second page , select the default text manual . you can select the passages often used , without having to type it . the passages may be made of course .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ lds . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can interpre@@ t the word lists with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only spell words must be included in the Wor@@ lds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; it is clearly a input field for the scanning of your phrases ( the lower white field in screen shot ) and a main memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field at screen shot ) .
if you see k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the phrases you want . any spoken sentence will be attached to the main memory . you can select from it that will be spoken .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two maps , speech output and settings , the page Wor@@ th@@ enters and the K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the voice card of the voice output , enter the command to enter the voice generator . in the selection box below the input field , you specify the character encoding as defined by the text generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be distributed as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be distributed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to voice your voice generator is of course . you can find this command in the documentation to your language generator .
if you are using the kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth is used as the first attempt to transmit the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . if this is a stand@@ ar@@ dised interface for voice @-@ over@@ s , the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action following the selection of a text passage , set out which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the texts folder or in the text box .
with the choice of so@@ ar , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added to the main memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage will initially be entered in the input field .
with the second drop down of the editing window for text @-@ pass , you can specify if the data password register should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
save the book , save the book . if you select changes , the password book is not saved . select Save &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the word clock data is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ al page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ lds . in the main window next to the input field , shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list can be more than a dictionary . with this drop down , you can choose the currently used dictionary for Wor@@ lds .
with buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or export it to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the selection box the language for the dictionary .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation . the frequency of the individual words will simply be determined by counting the letter . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add only the written words into the new dictionary .
using this option , you can combine the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together , and how these can be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , put a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re@@ issued notes automatically in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main range of the window for processing texts are two divided . in the upper part , the text box books are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key signature , you can only change its name .
items like new passages or books add or delete fonts or books you can either get via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text @-@ pass@@ holes or passages can be changed by pulling the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field is selected , this will be used otherwise select the selected areas of the processor .
the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if in the input field is selected , this will be used otherwise select the selected areas of the processor .
the currently active sentence is spoken , if text is in an input field , this is used otherwise select the selected sentences of the exp@@ eller .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed by default on the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sophisticated left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with exec@@ utions on the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this flag bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar with entries will be displayed with entries . the bar is positioned directly under the tool window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sophisticated left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another location .
probably you have entered the order for the voice output not properly or incomplete . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up settings and enter the order for the voice output in the voice card . ( see Settings dialog for Language Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a language issue system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use Festival for free and res@@ ell without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is believed that the festival is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a voice generator designed in &amp; Java . currently it supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and res@@ ell without restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to show an example of the command line for the command @-@ line output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder / us@@ r / local / fre@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech output is then possible with one of the three command examples : &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the third example , the option must be switched on as the default input . ( this is the recommended example for application of Free@@ T@@ TS ) .
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , receiving H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ st and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax swallowed up the last character of the text , so an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / / / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ / / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ / / local / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option will be switched on as the default input .
the speech dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; - Contin@@ ue language service which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice @-@ over@@ s . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the voice command is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to adjust to &amp; k@@ mouth if possible .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a use with the people who cannot speak , text by the calcul@@ ator . there &apos;s a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can re@@ produce new issues again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found by help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL in the address line of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start c@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the speech output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a utility by existing modules that allows any application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) ; it is a common use interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . users also offers interesting options .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; be embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
the speech output is performed by the program speech @-@ k@@ cher , which uses different background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows creation of language expenditure on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ dbus program .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta ( SM@@ ML ) .
the speech output of &amp; k@@ de ; , a application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
application with &amp; GUI , for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts of it .
a module for the editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file cannot be read entirely or partially .
in addition to Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ops ; in the k@@ de Acc@@ essi@@ bility Mail@@ ing list . here you can find the list via htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ .com / list@@ info / k@@ de Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will need to install and properly setup program @-@ files . see also
on the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card printer will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card is displayed .
most of the T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , such as well as various variants for a syn@@ thesizer . a fully furnished combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume and speed is also referred to as a speaker . you should at least use a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise , the program speed @-@ covers are otherwise used .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several printers for the same printer .
if you click on the card master spokes@@ man in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card printer will be displayed automatically , if you start ct@@ ose , and yet no speakers is set up .
all the configured speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear above in the list . the upper@@ most speaker is used for voice @-@ over@@ s when there is no pres@@ enter .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to shift the speaker in the list below . the order of the speakers in the list determin@@ es its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girls voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new Sp@@ ok@@ es@@ man is on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can already use it . go back to the card map , and check whether the voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , therefore , you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create text files to create and manage text records . see .
if you have set at least one speaker , you can open the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map maps to open this map . here you can set up some general options .
mark the check box for activ@@ ating the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this is the start of the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text mot@@ ions and allow text applications and make the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; get de@@ activated .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ aler ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; keep on , if the field is over@@ flowing ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the reading is complete .
with buttons in this row , you can start text mot@@ ions , susp@@ end , stop and record again .
with buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or read a text file to preview . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be adopted on all sides .
the card assign@@ ments will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card and cross there language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; you can proceed to the text of the displayed web page . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then , select the text that will be read before . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ ten@@ ders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can proceed to the text editor . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run the text that will be read before , and then select the text from the menu . then , the voice output should begin .
this also works if &amp; Kate is embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Not@@ ice is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you informed about the events specified by you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various kinds of messages ; for example , you can notify you of any kind of messages when your nick@@ name comes in , in which your nick@@ name comes forward . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then proceed to the IR@@ C news text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ ice , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in menu Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Not@@ ice can vary depending on application .
filter for string tools offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it &apos;s a good example . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is sent to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b out of the news that can send by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since this can be accepted as provided . read also .
filter are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in fil@@ tering the text is handled , before it is sent to the program speech @-@ fre@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to choose incorrect words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select appropriate language and actors or to deal with certain errors of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ fol@@ ks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Screen Re@@ a@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; output has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the updated jobs will be continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and holds the issue of news and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning again .
News have the next est priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . while you &amp; eg ; you can find a long text on a website . &amp; k@@ de ; alerts are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text records . every order , which you assign@@ able from the card card , is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text records . text applications are intended for the issue of longer texts which have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen re@@ aders . when applying the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such prescri@@ ption , this edition will stop and end .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ pris@@ als . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , text@@ books as well as to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and transfer it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
string plac@@ er replace parts of a text by other text . the resulting parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expres@@ sions : - ) by text or for form@@ att@@ ing messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better stand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker distribution boxes , you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program , send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice for example , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters have adjustable rules , according to which it is used for voice @-@ over@@ s . if the filter does not apply the text , he continues to change the text by the next filter .
if a text contract , a warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send them by all activated filter , which have been set up on the page below . the processing by filters will be shown in the order from above .
this displays the list of the furnished standard filters . if a filter does not cross , it is not enabled and is not used . filters are then moved from the top upwards down@@ wards .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of fil@@ let , and the below settings are displayed below .
if you have to set up a list of words or regular expres@@ sions than compar@@ ative patterns , these patterns will be exchanged in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding spare text .
specify a name for your filters . you can select this name as desired , it must be distinguished by the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in column agreement and replace it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is displayed in the displayed sequence from above .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to save the current list , or delete a list from the file to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter will only be applied , if the spokesperson for the text order is one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also hold multiple languages when using the mouse click the &amp; C@@ trl ; key pressed .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ ent@@ a . example : conversation , K@@ mail
the application ID programs provide you with the program q@@ dbus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must allow you to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ dbus . the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 may only be copied .
the string bag filter will only apply to the text if all the conditions are empty with an entry in the box . are all input fields empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when compared to words , the animation filter uses regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ . words ( spaces ) must be limited to both sides .
in this manual , you can find no guidance for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; used in the pack@@ ets package .
&amp; XML ; - trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is an W@@ 3C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ for@@ med@@ ness XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c relief program must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific nar@@ rator , which is set on the card spokes@@ man or for a speaker with certain properties . you can , for example , can specify that text from K@@ mail should be read from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filters , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker will be selected by the spokes@@ man for the text , send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the text on the card box speakers you can write the selected nar@@ rator .
if the text is entered here , the filter will be used if the text contains the given regular expression . it is based on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; used by clicking on the button to get help with a click on the button .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
put the properties of the speaker &apos;s required by you . when the text shown above shown the filter conditions , the speaker will be selected to show the desired requirements . click on the button to view the dialog box selection .
use this buttons to save or load your microphone settings or delete all settings .
the speaker distribution filter will only apply to the text , if any conditions apply with an entry in the box , apply Apply filter if you need to add at least one condition .
the language @-@ voice API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer to give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language issue API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice @-@ output via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Speech .
text of text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you can .
open two &amp; console connections ; windows . start a kt@@ ops in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re@@ shap@@ ing filter , but on the use of the module for festival pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone to work with that S@@ able at all . if you don &apos;t have to use this voice at all , then make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c will be installed and to find on the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or points of pun@@ ctu@@ ation seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that all pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only che@@ eks . what can I do against it ?
make sure that the encoding encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . can there be problems with certain characters or words , you may possibly be fixed by a string be@@ et filter . see .

the language syn@@ thesizer , used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license you can find in the associated documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that own a license .
if you have access to K@@ DE source code Archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility with &amp; kt@@ ts ; find it in the folder . besides , you will find the source code from k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages on the site htt@@ p : / / Speci@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and I@@ so@@ ber .
KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched at the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , drag the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information , which are not included in this hand@@ book .
the program &quot; speech @-@ to@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for using another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , you can get in touch with the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters is not mandatory but Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including package k@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; speech @-@ fol@@ ks . &quot;
if you get the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; get here from the source text for k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility or download the program created every night of the program created with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if speech @-@ clo@@ ver works properly with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; this is the first release of the program of the program . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g is designed to be developed directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sets . the user can go pun@@ ctu@@ ally or sat@@ in , repeat the issue or cancel .
if there is an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set up the preferred speaker for the issue , for example , if you want a female English voice , this will automatically select the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker cho@@ oses , see you in .
if you click on the card button or click &quot; Apply &quot; to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card printer display is shown below . for example , the module for festival interactive is shown below . for details of the modules you can find below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable program . if the Path to Festival in PAT@@ H is included , you just have to enter the festival .
choose the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . in favour , this setting is made automatically . generally speaking , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , adjust volume , speaker speed and sound height of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a number of controls and this gray is displayed , the voice will not be displayed by you .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark the check box , these voices will already be syn@@ thes@@ ized on the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( for larger storage usage ) the first set will be faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have a spokes@@ man ( or don &apos;t forget to click ) . see .
if the check box is marked , at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window will be displayed . otherwise , only the kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to show the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this way , you have the possibility to survey or otherwise control the device .
here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of phrases and the just mach@@ ined movement . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card speaker .
with buttons in this row , you can go on in the order that is selected in the list below , or return in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be taken over to the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed but AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio card instead . see also .
only text files are listed and managed . editions of Screen Re@@ a@@ ing , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
choose the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module compiled or kt@@ ops ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , select at least one module , select the PCM device here . see also
adjust the audio speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to the double normal speaker speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program So@@ x needs to be installed .
please click on to use the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all the PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in case of doubt , select standard .
on this map card you can set up special actions which will always be run when the text contract is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Screen Re@@ a@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; output has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the edition of the Screen Reader has been read , the received orders are res@@ umed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
war@@ nings have priority the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts the news . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just make a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; even someone welcomes the room .
if a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text is interrupted . if both conduc@@ tive sound are active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card only apply to normal text applications . for messages , war@@ nings , and the issues of screen re@@ axes , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ not@@ ebook messages can be found , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the flash@@ ing map appears .
check this check box for reading the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Not@@ ices to switch off . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; read no alerts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read out .
use this buttons to add events to list or delete events . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message sending &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in a IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , will be ignored .
use this drop down menu to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following selection :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the features of the required microphone station . standard select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speakers as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if there is a certain event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option the action is to carry out under standard ( all other events ) .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the above noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button to save the settings for a file . use the button store to store the stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on delete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is an W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice @-@ voice . this standard includes brands for controlling the voice and the pitch . also brands for control of pron@@ unci@@ ation , for example Ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations include :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice , which is used in the SS@@ ML issue .
if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog not be set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is commonly spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE @-@ PU@@ BL@@ IC &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE , PU@@ BL@@ IC &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama Bär . who has slept in my bed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bear ? &#93; &#93; &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . this can only start with the pre@@ fix , since only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not all the text order . so , you can also cancel the full text or withdraw or cancel , even if the speech syn@@ thesizer is not supported directly .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will automatically add a pro@@ positi@@ onal sign filter . you can change its settings or add further set @-@ mar@@ gin@@ alized fil@@ tering , but beginners will not use .
the easiest way to learn how to activate the microphone selection through drop@@ outs . switch on the box menu , which actors &amp; kt@@ ts ; select some features and check out how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you need to set up some more than one speaker , otherwise the filters have to be eff@@ ec@@ tual .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then , faster with the advance can start , since only the first set has to be processed and not all the text block , which can take a long time ,
you can then cancel texts on the card card or cancel , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ level detection filter will automatically be set up when you start kt@@ t@@ gr for the first time . it can not be shut down only . don &apos;t change anything at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
compare with a regular expression of detection , compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal phrases and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the typ@@ ing . note that the standard set @-@ level detection filter controls the character string .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally well , and there are several voices and languages supported . for many voices , you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help with this you will find in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . German voices are subject to limitations .
this voice puts the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a c@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 bit@@ - ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; that allows managing network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be called by selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to manage the users the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for users :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; displayed . the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting neither control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network networking settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t have to install . physical devices and their drivers have already been fully installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is shown and setting the network features .
in most cases , driver for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing and set up . network units will be added later , the drivers must be loaded after the following files , corresponding to the kernel version :
the network settings will be loaded if the network settings are selected in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings this one tries to automatically detect the platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release date . by selecting the setting non @-@ again qu@@ eries , the definition can be permanently hit . in the next start@@ up of the network settings , this selection is automatically pre@@ set .
changing the network settings can only be displayed in system administration mode . before , all options can only be considered , changing settings are not possible . in system administration mode , you can click on the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in system administration mode . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button , set up the device in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Extended Settings dialog .
the TCP / IP settings for the system can be operated using a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information will be required for any system start and therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , will be selected according to the system .
the Manu@@ ally can be carried out without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration must be specified . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ ates network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values given in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address will not be used within the network . entering a TCP / IP conflict , you can determine if the desired address is already used in use . in the case , the network administrator should be requested .
network appliances can be activated or switched on according to your needs . activ@@ ating a network device , activ@@ ating from the list and clicking the interface ...
network appliances can be activated or switched off according to your needs . in turn , an activated network device is carried out by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
establ@@ ishes the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name due to the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer only calls for IP addresses . if the computer uses htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the player name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS entries can be set up in the list with buttons , up or down@@ under in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... you can add a DNS server to the user computer . it will be added to the dialogue New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group computer to the name resolution you select one entry and then click Edit button .... It will be displayed to dialog Edit .
the list named IP @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily on bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server .
usually , the list contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . this will still be replaced by IP in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click &quot; Add &quot; The dialog New also to add .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has several alias names , add button adding several times and enter the further alias name .
choose an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog of the Computer dialog will be displayed .
if one of the following tasks are executed , then the list of the static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in Module Network settings are not effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command has to be removed .
the website of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distribution ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and inside a single panel ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should accomplish this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be discussed in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files are discussed .
this area can &apos;t replace more information about IP networks . this app@@ endi@@ x contains only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network .
today , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been dis@@ continued to spread it . this description is therefore currently focused on the common IP@@ v4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator can be assigned to a valid IP address . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when placing a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected to avoid IP address to the global ( internet ) network . the addresses from table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be done by adjusting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask will usually be set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are included in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard Route ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for the IP address .
the network address 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 can be reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 is an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which operates as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified by DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections to find another content than specified there .
for &amp; SuSE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; N@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first target was to answer a surface for tar , which provided the ability to answer a question that my wife took : how much longer does it take ?
before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; N@@ dat ; trains the tape and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; you don &apos;t know if the tape is form@@ at@@ ted if the tape is form@@ at@@ ted .
recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; looking for the matching index on your disk . can this not be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the index index is to be created .
if everything has gone smooth , the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the tape appears . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the band .
before throwing the tape , first the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; N@@ dat ; gives you a change in the symbol for the band to realize the integration of the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be kicked out without risk .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
one band cards need to form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not have to form@@ at@@ ted the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; this procedure does not have to be form@@ at@@ ted before you have to form@@ at@@ ted the tape . floppy tape drives are usually not form@@ at@@ ted for DA@@ T drives .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the date the volume will automatically be integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup , you need to select the secured files , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved by this file or folder .
mark a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
check files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the She@@ chem menu ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog for backup will open . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog for backup appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive . it will only be checked out the selected file or folder .
check the files in one of the archives in entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
once the test procedure started , the dialog for Chec@@ king Settings . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the dialog for Chec@@ king the dialog , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the testing process and the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can access the restore , the files you need to be recovered . this can be done in two ways :
choose a file or folder in one of the archives which include the entry for the tape drive . it will only be restored to the selected file or folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click a file or folder in one of the archives and choose from the menu restore ....
once the restore process has been launched , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the dialog for Rest@@ oration , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of re@@ formation as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to re @-@ create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band contents . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ build the index on two types of the band :
this is a safety profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a secure profile :
the current work folder , where the backup should be done . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the newly elected work folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , are the file being stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are stored on other file systems , you can separately put them under backup files . every entry is considered as tar regardless of the other file system .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used since the last incre@@ mental backup file . only the files have been backed since .
the name of the file , which is used to set changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons are supported ; and lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the belt device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command converts back to the drive . some drives are necessary before reading or write operations .
if the option is switched on , &amp; k@@ dat tries to lock the cast at the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work on all band@@ drives .
if the option is switched ON , the sol@@ dering of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically shut down the tape . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , you tried &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no @-@ all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you have to tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , you have to inform the block size for your band@@ run .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only display a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The volume ID . the format of this string is name : seconds , the machine name is form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is passed since the ep@@ och has been form@@ at@@ ted in which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archive that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup job . this symbol is only active if a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for un@@ used users who can &apos;t know where to get information about your system or where the system provides information on the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ systematic log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; helps users to understand what your computer is doing in the background . the program is used for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the various protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; k@@ systematic log ; experienced users to provide quick access to information about problems which appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , some advanced features may be filtered and analysed directly with their help .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ systematic log ; a number of useful functions . among others include :
support for many different types of log files , for format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and sam@@ ba
many other functions also include and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screens , &amp; k@@ systematic log ; functions are available , with their help you can filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file and are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tempted &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all , you don &apos;t want to open it , and it will open itself instead of a small message box , and it will probably not open with system administ@@ rators . the protocol files usually have no just@@ ification for reading the normal user .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or following strings . in the default setting , the list of the log file will be displayed automatically , so that only log file will be displayed in addition to the filter line . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter search term .
you can also select a different entry at this point . in addition , select the fil@@ ename of the filter search then only with entries in the selected column , and carry out in the filter bar the name of a process , so shows &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default settings and helps you identify the key protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a striking colour as protocol stack . the colored display of protocol @-@ lines can be shut down setup dialog .
if you are looking for only a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , this allows you to examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to activate new lines in context menu of the main window to show all new added protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ menu , select a protocol to display them .
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; has a dedicated website to htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you find further information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ systematic log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well known ( and listed below ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section shows a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it is rapidly developing the standard for controlling the program start @-@ up of the system in der &amp; Linux ; this is because it &apos;s easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD inputs .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( for example , because I do not know about it : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it without having a re@@ installation and new form@@ att@@ ing . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it also differs from BSD inputs , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you would like to run on a different run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should now lie down under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do not own this file , even if you don &apos;t want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default run@@ level is listed in / etc / in@@ itt@@ any . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change the default , then you can change / etc / in@@ itt@@ off by hand and then you can repair it when you rest@@ art the system and execute the following :
but how does it all start the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l enter r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like this :
you will notice that in this folder no right files are located . instead , each entry is link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it &apos;s a argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scrip@@ ting by hand on the command line as follows :
this would keep the htt@@ pd servers . in@@ it reads the name , and when it includes a K , the script will be called stop @-@ stop . if it includes a S , the script will start using the argument .
some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server Run@@ level , that can only run htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . I also could have a user @-@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other po@@ inter is easy to not tri@@ vial , simply drag an entry in the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start at this level ( or stop it ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen when you remove an entry from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen when you draw a record from the scope of availability .
note : entries are moved to copy these into a new area . to add them to a new run@@ level , you have to select copying from the menu Edit or from the Con@@ text menu , and even if this entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion .
the sorting number of a entry can sometimes be calculated sometimes . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the ambient entries , before you can try again to add the system service .
note : there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so use caution .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working ranges ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous one .
to move one entry into another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it in the desired run@@ level with insert ( C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry , press the button button to change the features dialog . use the dialog button to accept the dialog button to accept the changes or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation to be executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the Standard Run@@ lev@@ eling , and now the machine starts continually . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input -@@ button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they will not be executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in this distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the species , such as system services in this distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of this distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution system : please check if all the configuration files are available ( and also whether they are in the right @-@ list ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) are simply complete without any message , if their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the section adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you have to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of tool@@ bar or record stores in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy use . the main window consists of two maps , user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the required group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group features .
some card cards will only be displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you can make space limits ( Qu@@ ota ) for user , a card card will appear on which you can change individual settings . other cards are displayed if shadow passwords , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d will be installed as in BSD UNIX .
the card password appears where shadow passwords , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD UNIX .
this card will only be activated and initi@@ alized for at least a built @-@ in file system ( Qu@@ ota ) , and initi@@ alized ( see file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , data limits can be changed for each user parameter :
this parameter can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system will be selected using the array of space system .
the map cards inform groups of the selected users of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user is owned , can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ ology field . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by select them in the large field .
the Group dialog features a list of users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select from the user or group or click the right Add button of tool@@ bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group will be analog .
with this module , you can add , remove and change the boot passage , remove time to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , change and more .
