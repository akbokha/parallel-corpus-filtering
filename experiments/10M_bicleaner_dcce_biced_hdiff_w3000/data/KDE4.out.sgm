<seg id="15">At & fsview; reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of size of the entries is specified. so, large files can be easily detected if they can be seen far below in the file's hierarchy. so, & fsview; as a graphic and interactive version of the UNIX & UNIX; command you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; an entry in the Treemap account represents a rectangle that represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation use the rectangles and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched by color mode, can either be depth for easy detection of shading depth or the picture of another file member such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various features of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can specify if sufficient space is available at all, or if sufficient space is displayed by the sign of the Treemap. in addition, you can specify the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In display algorithms for Treemap should generally be kept, that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & fsview; this target will not always be stopped. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to split the area of an entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation is left. it is always beneficial to the areas such as rectangles that rectangles; the best methods are to be square. the best methods of this case are lines, columns, or recursive role.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera will also be used as a disk drive. the camera will also be used as a disk drive. older cameras can also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digib2; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera lenses. gPhoto2 is also a free, further distribution protocol for digital cameras, a widely distributed protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial line for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port, this connection is now obsolete. & digiplug. supports this cameras and guides the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support, so that the thumbnails could not be read from some libgphoto2. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2. if the EXIF support could not be done in libgphoto2. if the EXIF can't be used, or the creation might be very slow.</seg>

<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location. if you have enough photos, then you will be able to organize subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. if you can download a folder for pictures you will print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like versioning the photos, archiving, working processes, constant access of images on different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will be and you will not rearrange your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. they will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata in the settings page of the metadata in & digial. this ensures that EXIF data and IPTC data can be stored into the file, then you can then select the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens when you want to change what? to this, & digiplug The metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are the main ones of course.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work, as you should now select the keywords, labels and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that the same attribute will require and then set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now let us talk with keywords, keywords like other programs often, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogised images from another source with embedded sampler, it is not a problem and can easily place the tree in the tree; it can easily be done by connecting a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are being done by & digious; updated while the trees are pursued.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata is outgoing. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool for Cataloglyze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to just see your photos simply, you want to share it with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then start to see some details, people, space.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the landestal place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. Wow! one starts to dream, associations, the historical time span is again present, you may even hear the silence. the label thus has changed its perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others, consider your photos may be more important than the image itself. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to help him to understand Him about the motive which you move is to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if the strength only has to work with an inscription for themselves alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug, you can save as much text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8) as an inscribing. if you can even export your images in Web-galleries, these labels will be able to tell you to your wishes and / or the title of the web-gallery. you have to tell you a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was earth not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation drives already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to use geolocalization can already be lost. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can view your journeys by shooting with geographic data. and you can also view the photos on the site. you can also export the pictures from Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice the copyright to remove limitations about the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is mentioned in the setup page of & digial; information is requested:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should have your name, or the name of the person that has been created. if it is not desired to protect the identity of the photographer, then it can no longer be changed. after that, it cannot be changed. this field does not support Tramas nor Semikolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonymous with author): associated with the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples can be as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. as this is a note to the author field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publishers (synonym for providers): use the bidder field to identify who the picture offers. if the photographer is listed for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed below. if the picture is a stock photo here, the group / agency shows the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright section. anyone who has no protection against abuse. anyone who has no more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator. this is the solution to this problem only by low interest. for individuals, this protection is very important for individuals. for professionals and half professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each image. & digipie; in the near future, a module for staples processing is available.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, panel failure, power failure, ECC, transmission errors, aging the storage media, recovery, redundancy, dessert, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs on the road or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper shots or negative. in this section it is about problems with so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Roll Ontrack, the biggest data recovery firm in the world, has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, this cautious might have to be treated more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece has a life time of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your heart space room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording tools. the best DVD recording tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so, it's about choosing the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to fault, even if you have just been writing a control function to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and the control sum. despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there's a cheap program called IsoBuster which seems to do wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; however, it is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to gain the format war against HD DVD. a dual-player Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual player DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs, of course also applies to Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good capture device to high-quality media in a non-propriated format. please read the media with a description, date & author labels and afterwards on a clean, dark dry and protected animals protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers keep your statistics for itself. your manufacturer's manufacturer include a new disk, but not the data. Google is providing a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives at your disposal: dismisstudy</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon, during the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C, the most common error situation, SMART can not determine the most common error. some of SMART are unable to determine the immediate failure. these are particularly Lesefehler and publishing teeth. the expected lifetime amounts between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a current failure, but these losses can usually be produced without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices are not too much easier, this can take a difficult damage in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these anomalies may cause severe damage. thus, protect motherboards and other defects, therefore protect themselves from the inevitable that leads to loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most popular protection against electricity points is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of energy seats and rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug bar. but remember that not every plug-in line contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. they should also ensure that it protects the protection against lightening and protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since there is an overvoltage of any cable to your computer, you should also make sure that all the peripherals that can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage spills which also include a phone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for coaxial cable of cable modems and television.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and they are also very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from smaller swelling into the power lines it will not really help you. even a failure of few seconds can cause the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore it can be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically save battery energy. this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system. if you want a UPS to keep the same quality requirements, you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of battery and the supplied software may be interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that your hostile system is exposed and comparing your safety in current problems with the costs at avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used as well as your computer with it. at the end you should always think of all cable to trenne before you stay in the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. using the right configuration, you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular deal with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, however, it is very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you must send data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suited as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but there is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-Community 23hq.com are available online. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available, in the case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 a year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data protection, web solutions are very secure. transfer errors are automatically adjusted by the TCP protocol and in the large companies offer a backup and a diverted memory. therefore, they are desastersafe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system zfs and btrfs set up the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you have occurred when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have destroyed a photo and that's no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is much more secure data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transfers losses, as they generate interferences within the data stream. normal file system errors are unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not especially affected by transfers, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems appears to be one of two candidates who can cope with record errors in low level and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon also for Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used for use and is also available for Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss during notebook and 46% with the job systems. Notebooks are the proportion of theft 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most increases. it is limited to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source filesystem are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to provide the common filesystem support here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigating process is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are removed from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while technology is further developed, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and space characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deteriorated for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit of 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so you do not have any data loss for data loss. so do your data frequently be affected by a data loss. thus, secure your data after a plan and test this backup before using any thing as the reinstallation of your operating system, exchange records or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your backups on an external SATA drive. if, one day, a flash, you're lucky when the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster defeats locally and destroys a lot. forget planes alone: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole space or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disaster prevention means always not local storage. get your backups up the stairs into the neighboring house, your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above already mentioned is a common cause for data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be secured. it is a snapshot without history and constitute a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential assurance.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can make the original status at any time to recover such a backup. this backup will only take a versioning system next with the exception that it is just off and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool which you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only the difference of files that have really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you to recover enough time to detect and restore losses. at the end you come to a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. each additional dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Subjects: metadata, stored IPTC data, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, relocating images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years, that is roughly the time span that you are truly interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you have to consider all what is said today with caution. unfortunately, there is no other option to enrol with caution. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible, the more easier is to rate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and safekeeping technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is a specialist pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us assume that you have planned to put the scalability with a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this range and store it onto a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command if your new record has been detected by the system, but do not hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC # source; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate at MBPCI; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and travel FS & dollar; residu2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if no software can read it, then you can create this yourself. this task is easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, they should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard of GIF. however, it can store much more. it can store much more. it is capable of backup XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, but it is a relative many administration information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format we would recommend to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. it manages images in high quality or stored in a container with a lossless compoidm (deflate), but it's very large files. with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negative file format is a licensed and open picture format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed because of the needs of the camera image formats. DNG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon as well.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology; a combination of XML and RDF; it is a combination of XML and RDF; it is a combination of XML and RDF. it concerns the file information with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive the original size of your photo, mostly in the raw format. however, the metadata must be stored separately from the metadata file and the picture file will be displayed, so you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application-purposes and business models. on the DCMI activities, work on architecture and workshops, standard conferences and workshops, standard connections and connaissful efforts to reach a further acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures are on the camera, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your primary archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered processing, you can use external programs. if you re-edit the pictures back with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under circumstances from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export it only then in Webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera-interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digial. in the section Add a photo to an album you will find a description as you already have on your hard disk. but the camera interface makes you many advanced settings for importing images to your album cover.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, connect it to the camera to turn off the camera to the display mode and switch it. a further description of the camera will be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you launch the camera interface, this will take you to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a pre-thumbnail appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras do not display the thumbnails for any file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information about each entry. using the features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog features file properties and the camera information, which is stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab Metadata shows the internal metadata, such as EXIF, Manufacture, GPS, etc. of the image. these information are the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of & digial; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on the button is the click on the button downloading and then download the photos from her camera to a single album in & digial; for downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to delete the photos from your camera before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, download the button downloading and then download selection. download the button selection is available as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera supports this, a new option is available to download. in this case, the new pictures were available with a star in the incident. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the buttons available, download a dialog, with which you can download the target album, in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be displayed in section My albums. select the list of albums from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After finishing the target album, press OK, and & Go; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from your camera. you can delete all by using the button. if you want to delete it all, then you must select it first and then delete deleting.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to delete photos that you have deleted from the camera; you should be fully deleted if you want to delete the photos in a & digial deposit box. if you want to delete the camera system completely, you should read it more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often not used as filenames for the photos frequently. the filenames can usually be recycled, if you load photos from the camera in the same album, so it may be useful, the date and time to which the image has been made to incorporate the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirrors the picture and for date based subtitles. if you use this latter option, it will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three additional options to be performed before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from EXIF data into the IPTC range. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% d% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file name in lowercase. or in uppercase, if you prefer it.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digiplug, is used for a photo, will be displayed below the name, displayed the camera in the preview. its settings for renaming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera's next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digial; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic turn during shutdown. not all cameras are available. in the sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information embedded in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is switched ON, and when your camera does not deliver this information, the photo is set off. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the button rectangles and choose the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made available, at which the photo was made, at the disposal of the picture. all images are loaded onto the picture album. all images with the same date are available in the same subtitle. all images with the same date are available. in the sidebar Meta-data you can read out what information can be embedded in the photographs.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case it stores & digiplug. if you want to change this, you have to disable this option and select the option Date-based Subverbs at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is button downloading. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; will then be uploaded to which you can select the files that are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, it asks & digial; you, where the pictures should be loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear and press OK to start the uploading. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means that the data can be displayed in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic absorption of GPS data to map. environment plan, military, police, architectural office and property makler can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten your photo, where exactly the photo was made, you can click with a click to view the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious location, or just send it to this aspect, it is good to provide the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 is supported by many GPS data fields such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, about a reprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to geographic information (manual) and last beyond manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few who collaborated with GPS receivers or by sending the data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: coyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done by gpsone or GPSBabel. however, you have to save these data in the GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the geographical allocation.</seg>

<seg id="288">IPTC actions save the data into the respective IPTC field. this way, the metadata must permanently appear in the picture and not only in the database of & digial. these metadata is also available and can be imported into & digious data; imported without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images save as embedded labeling (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos, with the labels included in the images. thus, your labeling can also be read by other images, they will be overwritten by the letters written by the digial code.</seg>

<seg id="293">The settings of the lightbox of & digial; can then be set on this site if possible. some pictures have switched on. some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have a number of images and the synchronous mode, you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better clearances.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can use the tool bar, when using the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are displayed here. in the image processing the mode of application can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling it is meant that the pictures are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color formations. please read this article in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG-files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: 1 low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF-files option, you can use the deflate compression salons for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality because the deflate algorithm is loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting-free JPEG 2000 files you can lossless save. even if you are writing the loss-liable setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than when this paragraph was not supported yet, however, metadata was not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digial versions, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it's rapidly becoming a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default reference is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option in ultraviolet light. if you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option draws a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white comparison of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a solid color balance, which was shot on a white map that was shot in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors, this option will get more details in four stages. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top shlichter, so the parts of your camera will begin to consider a shimmering white in the settings. the setting colors are generated by some unusual results, as it shows the nickname in various rose tones. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing parts from the plants.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally not as fast as green and red. & digicraw are therefore trying to reconstruct the missing green and red shark. of course this is a question how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option to construct a level, it is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each picture individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminance value to your liking. you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digial; and, to keep the time for humility, should not be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">One demoosaicing algorithm is a digital image process that come from a complete picture of the partial image sensor that provides many cameras and provides a matrix-coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbreach.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiw; and Dcraw provide three alternatives at your disposal: Bilinear, VNG interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm created by DLevin, but it produces colour artacts on the edges. Bilinear was interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can put the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a colorability correction, as it is carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color formations and gives instructions how they should be given again. there are also LCMS and & digious; information such as the color formations of a color space in the other, so the colours are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions, when a picture is opened in image processing / color administration module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile File Following the folder, such as / usr / share / color / color / color / color / / or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digial; examines this folder during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">The ICC profiles stalls are available here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles, everything can be changed later when opening up the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color scheme view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colourfully not administrated the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be attached to the camera lock and model you are using. not all profiles are contained in the same way. currently, dcw Gamma is not corrected for conversions at 16 bit depths. this means that you must perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile, with which you can emulate as your image has to be given back as your printer has a smaller paint area as your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated, instead of depend on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile for them is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here's a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion makes the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for Portraitand S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & kde; illustrated and image processing is supported; many modules have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of available modules. then you will see the list of available modules and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond that you will find some also in the context menu of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shortcuts for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu below Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) via KIPI modules can be found at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide settings should simply be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the outputs, normally there are 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes switches or out, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics appear on the left hand side a list of all the time supported cameras. on the right side, a button is automatically linked to identify the camera. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, USB- and USB / FireWire-mass storage are supported here.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom of the bottom, you can set the path for USB and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera. this field is only active if you have a USB or FireWire mass storage camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / Camera or / mnt / kgs, where you can mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, you need to connect the camera to your computer and turn it up in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if & digiplug got; the camera will automatically detect. if not, you can set camera model and port manually after your camera is set up in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of confirmation of &gt; pictures in the trashcan display, you can set up the dialogue of & digibbin. in the deleting of a photo in one album, you can find more details to delete a photos and delete an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can still be shut down by & digial; if you use the option to use changes in the right side bar without consideration. otherwise, you need to apply changes to the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the welcome screen at & digial; starting to start, it accelerates the startup process of & digial.</seg>
<seg id="334">At the start of the new photos, after new photos you were looking for new or deleted albums / photos. this extended the start time of & digial. if something from the base file was deleted, it will ask you if it should delete it out of the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digiplug. select the main window to your liking. these settings can select from the toolbar settings. a preview of available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digial; find further information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digial; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button on the thumbnail and selecting the entry menu / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digial. so, they are not part of your distribution. you will find further information about the KIPI modules in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A flag line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current file number, and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar for fast access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly produce a copy of your picture before you change it. this you can save save as possible.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not stored the photo, you can restart the original image by using the Edit menu or restore the button Recover of the tool bar. then you lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last stay.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of imaging can be reversed and restored. the latest action can be reversed by selecting editing pane, or restore editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should choose the shortcut short, Ctrl; -z to reverse and specify Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the toolbar button for a moment longer, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will be reversed either.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword in the tool bar, picture up or the entries in the menu file. if you've made any changes on the current photo, you will ask if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">In the picture you can go in and out in that you Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the memory menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: enhance the expansion factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen saver displays the picture in full screen mode. you'll get to the normal view in which you want to use the Esc button. if you don't want this, you can call this at the settings dialog of & digial; you can see this from the digiplug. see the section for arranging the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">When you want to print the current image, you can print image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or full sentences. all images from your selection can be printed out from your selection and choose from the menu Export printer wizard. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digial window; main window has a side bar on the right edge, which provides important information and promotions for the selected image files, also available in image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders will be clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab, the sidebar will appear or disappear again in the edges.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can enter or insert labs with unlimited size. note that the text is UTF-8. that means that all the special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut according to 2000 characters. if you want to use IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented on, use either the button, or switch to the next picture, the labels will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the Apply button there is one button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also read the metadata in the files. this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting, which is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">This section shows a value scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. to rate multiple images at the same time, select it from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords below shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword and a selection box with previously applied keywords; session applied.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is adapted dynamically to the given search word. you can retrench the number of options in search of a keyword fast. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom ends is another relief for typing keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view, and choose a keyword in the keyword tree, and not apply to the whole selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="366">The bar line filter bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar will be used with their album, - date, sample and viewpoints from the right, will only display the quantity of these two. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop you back in the main view. if the keyword is already exist, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection. after that, a dialog you ask if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example shows the main window the images on a calendar day. the keyword filtering is reduced to one calendar day. you have been selected with Strg + a, and then a keyword from the right-right-tree on the selection is drawn and put away. a dialog is asked if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled via settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find out that it should be one or more, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, which is searched in the database, can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can e.g. set a Extended search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options only, you just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why one sets a colorable workflow, the colors of your camera or scanner can achieve a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or engraved colors. with a colorable workflow, you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner which match the colors of your camera or scanner which match you from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color management, then everyone wants to press the results he wants to press. unfortunately, colour scheme is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour management. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your photo-level meets the criteria listed below, you must not take care of colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor of the sRGB color space is calibrated. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other educational issues are via e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So, if RGB works well and makes life for all so easy, then why should one use a different colour space and have to make thoughts about colour vulnerable?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colours we can see, the hufeisenregion, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spheres, please visit Bruce Lindblooms excellently and click on info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to crack my monitor, if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you will need to monitor your monitor using sRGB that you will need to use your monitor on sRGB at sRGB, then you have to either use your monitor on sRGB standard, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool makes five automatic corrections available, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The normalize, automatic, automatic and contrast, from the Menrigate automatic correction try automatically to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled down the actual picture, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing his colour shades. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Compensated: this method adjusts the lightest factor in the colours of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity visible is as flat as possible. it is also only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation which causes either marvel at a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue canal. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels onto the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enlarge: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by switching the lowest and highest values in the highest possible range and a regroup of all values in between. this is only visible when washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white equal to & digial came; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white abnormaly of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white correction is slightly limited since an 8-bit color space is used, so far from the original image, areas can be performed with overexposure. if you work the white aboutcomes in the raw mode, your possibilities will be better to correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is protected by the Pawel T. Jochym protected by copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. click on the menu entry colors white comparison of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The forefront can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the tool can be seen. if you want to see the original white image, it's enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview photos has a red markers. the Luminance of Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right top is a histogram shown that once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful because, even in well lit images, most pixels is very small Luminance values. using a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjusts you to enhance the shadow on your photos or down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then anywhere in the image preview for calculating the color temperature of the white balancing. in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white comparison with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors, when more than a color channel of Pixels is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons stores save and load accurately this. every setting of the white balancing allows you to save in a text file and then load them later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button defaults all filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will be shown as your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding process per color channel of the machined image. 8-bit encoding is well suited for high quality images. this coding is also useful for high quality images. this coding is also available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignments of colour profiles. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be drawn from the colour scheme.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors of audio correction. this tool allows you to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so you can also use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same error. in the manual for the audio correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digial; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, has developed the effect of a short flash light and afterwards the development of the picture was completed. the result was a partial negatives of the picture. the result was a partial negatives of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">Intensity controlled the solar condition. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another increase is finally a negative image that does not produce on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar power effect. the original image is the (1) and it processes (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiation that makes it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name produced for a light-optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvet Mediaquot; and thus, a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvias strongly saturated colors are, but also some photographers, especially those which hardly believe the landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrast stitches. the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the Neonlight. with large pictures, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it's not unusual to change the color counters and the brightness of the photos. you can experimenting with the different color-effects of your photos with the tools in the menu. once you're satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo on poor lighting conditions, you can reduce the saturation problem instead of increasing the saturation instead of increasing the saturation. all alterations you can carry out in preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leuchstrength / contrast / Gamma is the tool key correction for enhancing the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of shavers: in concrete, the three slbers below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, an histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three shavers are clicked on into the side and the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">"" "" "" "the simplest way to learn the control is to move the knob and look at the same as the image changes." ""</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview can be dynamically modified, using the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this drop box can be adjusted, if the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a constant colour, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the upper for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammaize.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three paint brush plates can be used in the preview of the original color to adjust the inputs of the shade, medium and bright tones. Moreover, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values, such as the output values, for example, can be used to create a spreading picture as background while something else is foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as well as loading: with these buttons, the saved values can be saved in the file system and later reloaded. the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three color pids, the input lines will automatically be adjusted for all shade, medium and solar noise. select the colour pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the program for red, green, blu- and Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator indicator controls all color channels to view over exposure pixels and you can view the combined results of all channels. this is an indicator, so you'll see the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the entrants applied to the red, green and blue canal of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, and output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and fixed image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image is displayed. the preview can be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this drop is allowed to specify the canal that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to change between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures with a digital camera, the linear mode of a constant colour creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you postpone a short valves to the right, for example, the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones are darker with a darker balance.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red marking is shown. if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change it will create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. any curve that you created can be saved in file system and later loaded. the file format for this is Gimp Kurvenformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. select the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The check-exposure indicator controls all colour channels to view over exposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you will see the combined result. this is an indicator, so you'll see the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the luminance canal. shade- and sunny tones used with the colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Channel Mixer opens; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color scheme of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Channel Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images. you can edit it from the Colors Channel Mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the edge selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window can be presented to you. the original can be viewed compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red markers. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to indicate the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and building allow you to activate these channels. if you are using Luminance, this is especially convenient for creating great black and white conversion of your photos. try the green canal for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color becomes visible in the color canal and whose prey man looks different in each channel. if that's the case, you can reduce your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the color chips first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any blender setting can save it later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp-channel format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator indicator controls all color channels to view over exposure pixels and you can view the combined results of all channels. this is an indicator, so you'll see the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>

<seg id="457">With the digiplug bag; tool texture you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of it a color picture is or not, you can make it look like an old master, a pop type portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right to the depth or three dimensional of the texture on the picture.</seg>

<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not easy task. to keep the image an decorative border. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye. in the picture frame the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you make the desired frame type for your image. continuously transforms the image with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), depressed it with a nice three-dimensional setting. ideal for a button effect and decoratively add a brick frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the frame width of the frame in percent. value range for width is 1% to 50% limited.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original ratio. this is important for printing images, especially when you have used the tool following a aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can create simple a formulated text in an image at any place. this will also occur in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. the larger the picture, the larger the character set must be adapted. at the end, simply select a frame for the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>

<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should be able to add a copy of the file size. if you want to add your template around & digious; send an e-mail to the & digial; mailing list digip.org...</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you have to put your template folder with the knob base file in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next startup.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for templates has been set a tree view that reflect the file structure of the templates. the selection of a folder will automatically update the templates of templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>

<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template on your image. the picture is then automatically adapted to preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digipøn; introduces three different tools for sharpening. each of you have advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very quick and simple, but creates especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharply. you can use it more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric dst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">This is perhaps the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of the sharpness. elements the smaller ones are combined with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras will normally need more intolerable sharpening than normal cameras for the private use.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, the camera is often applied to internal sharpening. images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners require a sharpening filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening-sharpening. you can call it with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should avoid this though the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases sharpening of the edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, you can focus on the sharpening of a picture. you can reach it by using Refocus. on Refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw a bit soft than it is easier than to sharpening. use the tool to switch to the folder with the menu entry and experiment a little with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp maskeling is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the fillet with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values will generate good results and should be first tried out. an increase of the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the sharpness mask to be strong, rustling and the impression of grats are made close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius looks like many pixels on each side of a edge through the filters. high-resolution images allow larger radio. they should therefore take pictures most in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is placed.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the use difference-amount. it can thus be used for a seeding of the filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the teeth are exempted from the sharpness and therefore has to avoid beauty errors in chokes, sky and water surface areas.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp mascot filters. the original image is the (1) and the painted picture (2). unblurred mascot was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digiplug-in; tool refocussed on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to use the copyright protected-based encryption algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries an image to & quot; refocussed. this is better than trying to sharpening the picture. it uses a better technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. this is the use of a sharp bend. Refocus can usually start better results than unsharp masks. you can start from the menu by calling colors reflection in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding is much better than the Gauß's split. the Gauß's split has a very long tail, which will depend on the originate pixel pixels, which is widely influenced by the original quellpixel pixels, even in most cases, even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. those caused unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular Fill. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should look very unsharp, then on holy icons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation is reduced to the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Robberfilter: the filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values of 0-1 can help you. however, values are very low as 0.1. if the space filter is too low, and eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a useful value is 0.03. a high value is to still contaminate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should avoid this value to 0, to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value to zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the space filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in matrix size can produce good results, particularly if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's focus. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any reverb parameter you have set will thus be saved for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensities on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible, but the later unpleasant artifacts are left behind.</seg>
<seg id="507">When reading and compress images, eg. when JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unblurred masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be causing unblurred measles a bigger neighborhood use as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically clear mascures must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the infinity. for the Viennese filters it is always at least as good as the unharp mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better with the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filtering, on a small focused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color picture has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the focused result is attributable to auto-focus lens lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for sharpening correction in digitization, you can consult a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob's knob uses the sharpness of the range of darkness to produce a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinent makes a customized color for the pupil. in case you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the designed tool designed to remove non-desired artifacts with beispielloser speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Injection algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg-Project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various defaults as a starting point to simplify restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small amount led to a smooth smooth regions of smooth regions and details sharp. a value of 0.9% should get details so that no sharpening should be necessary. please note that the details should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction-dependence Alpha [0.100]: a small scale smooths evenly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film-grain or CCD noise, a high value of similar pattern would produce similar pattern. JPEG Artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor about alles. p defined the relative smoothing. therefore, put this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turmop effect, it needs to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: as often the algorithm is run through. normally, 1 or 2 is usually sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular stepwise as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha small is chosen, then it should also be small to generate a long runtime. so you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel glets and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">We use linear interpolation: the more quality you get by selecting this option is only minor. it doubles the running time. therefore, we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load precisely this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct error correction is comparatively very fast when working. however, it may take a long last time and load a high CPU load after it. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with small artifacts. as you see, it is shown on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. the original image is shown below (1) and the original image is under (1) and the fixed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digious reduction; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing image noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool displays selectable image filter, to remove stains and other artifacts, i.e. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of single-scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensor noise of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you need only the details pane and the Advanced Settings window can stay in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius is controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time the filters per pixel are needed and can be the image hidden on the picture and the color in it is smoother and therefore smaller mistakes can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch to check the filter backwards. if the value is too high if the value is too high when the value is too high, adaptive filters can no longer receive and crafting, or dirt again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response. if it is too strong, the whole noise can be removed or cateraser can occur. put it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak room or JPEG Artefacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the illuminance of the image. we recommend either colour or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either colour or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerant values of the darker areas, which typically are stronger to increase, but it is contaminated, however, the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phasenjitterdamping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius. if it is increased, noise and phasenjitter will appear on the edges. it can remove the noise and phasenjitter on the edges. it can remove predator and is the recommended method.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the reduction, which you have set, can be saved into the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how spatial reducing your life can change. the original image is marked with (1) and fixed with (2). the noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw a bit soft than a picture is fortunately enough to create a picture with the menu entry Korrigating and experiment with the plain list. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digial plans; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photographic files.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film kernels, scratches, compression and recreating images in digital, original or subsequently brimming with digital images and thereby gets the content as it is also the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the textures is performed using another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Franná and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossless compress, it generates some compresses & quot; artifacts; - small standards that are in uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load precisely this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may take a long last time and take a high CPU load after moving. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce how to reduce your photo with a like spacing.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken up with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film baskets on the faces. the original image is visible under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photo taken by a scanner that could see from the scanner lighting and photopapier. the original image is visible under (1) and the fixed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digiplug, tool Hotjam makes it possible to remove any hot pixel programs with a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from JPEGPixi project which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are particularly high with high quality raw materials, because many cameras with JPEG compression is equipped with a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and 'quot; light pixel quot; on a photo with a dark subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button Dark. the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you absorb the dark picture right in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the right dark picture to the correct image. note that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and automatically loads that automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image and the preview can help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filtering with current settings. poor pixels are emphasized in all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter to see. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: an average of the neighboring pixels is determined. the resulting colour is assigned to all defectives from the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block would be used to compose a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim), and then they are used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filename method. all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block is drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixel.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction in a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposing, the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug-correction is a tool for correct the Vignetting, i.e. the exposed corners of an image to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierquot; (shaded) they can reduce the edges and edges of the picture by bringing the light the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But also disadvantages. many Center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 while the aperture filter, which should be impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be able to use the Center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise unsharpening effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposing areas of today's film and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using a equivalent transformation in a picture based without these filters. the tool Vignettierrez correction, the transformation of a CenterFilter is applied to a picture. the algorithm is protected by the copyright of John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three Reglers you can control the Vignetting correction-correction and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density the filter. the default density amounts to 2.0, or randomly to offset the density by a greater degree of Vignetting to compensate it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuch strength, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the Vignetting correction is decreasing the brightness of the pixels. they must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options only, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to adjust a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, so let the values for brightness / contrast / Gamma at zero and use gradation out of the & digial; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetscape correction to be applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetization in the corners and (2) the correct image. a candleprop and contrast correction was also performed in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug came; Linking distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses in photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The second degree of frames covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but falls off on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grades corrects the removed rough opposite to the second degree. if you combine these two, every geometric distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the thickness of the distortion second gravity. with negative values, tonnenical distortions can be corrected and positive values for cutout distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth grades. this value is stronger to the edges as in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the opposite number has the opposite number of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and result in a correction of first grading. negative values increase the picture by positive.</seg>
<seg id="583">Radiant: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrating the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and the next startup as default values are used.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnal and cisular correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best result, perform this correction than any first. if you do a painting and then perform a tonnenical correction, the effect would seem obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction for you, this tool puts you a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it into an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in the connection you can correct the tonnal / cisular distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">"" "if you correct a cold-shaped distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them from the thumbnail to cut out from the image processing or zoom in this dialog." ""</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some images is enough. the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings is the perspective to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnenical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is reproduced under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range from 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters to simulate film grain and film sensitivity. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colour channels are mixed with infrared film, especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the Farbinations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film based on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image of the film was set to ISO 400. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the plants.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digial filter has a simple-used tool to reproduce film baskets on your pictures. this is known by classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, for the sensitivity of the films the manufacturers of large silver-emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film indicator gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want this special, Galerie-like, road photographic, graceful vision especially in your monochroms photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated for control of the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you still need more grains, then you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film-effects applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity complies with ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digiplug filter; filter oil painting generates the appearance of a oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digiplug filter; filter oil paintings gives up your digital images a nice appearance like oil paintings. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better suited for big images. smooth the smoothing or, from the other side seen from the other side.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil paintings effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the working size is marked with the (2) image size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and Glitter 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug filter; filter coal use uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. therefore, their gradients vary slowly but not ideal for this effect. it is helpful to imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (deposit).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon filter filter. the original image (1) and the changed picture (2). the default value of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug filter; filter engraving shaped your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digiplug Filur; Filur is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important content of content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondarken landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the painted picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter assembly you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses righted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave streams 1: divides the image in cells and let it look like it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Waves 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter assembly you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by means of unsharpness effects. additionally it uses protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Fsharpness: wipe the image along the circular lines going out from a center. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of often visible in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial imp: wiped the image by rotating the pixels around a focus. this simulates the sharpness of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Reinforce: wipe the image to generate the effect of unfocussed camera lenses. the object seems to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-sharpness: wiped the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographic, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Sharpness: get the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-images, or add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shakes unsharpness: wiped the image by random shifting of the pixels and simulates the sharpness of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Disclosure: find the paddling pool in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo into rectangular cells and then we created it through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make regentroping on your image. this makes it natural your pictures an impressive appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected by copyright algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Let the drip size allowed it to change the size of the image. because the drip size doesn't automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size and density of drop. Fischaugen changes the optical effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep an area free of rain drops at the digiplug. use the selection tool for the area, e.g. a face that should remain free of charge. if you start the filter shelf, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelf Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can take it by mirrors or rotating in the right orientation. you can find tools in the menu transformer, or transform.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture of residues is simple. the big question is, how can you invent a picture and see the details? how can you invent the missing information? how can you reinvent the missing information? how can you reinvent the missing information here? how can one find a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size and specify the target values in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">To change the tool, use a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. splinine interpolation to enlarge an image. & digial; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain a aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, the size of the original size is the original ratio of the originals.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turmoence effect, it needs to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and load are used exactly to them. any single file for photo can be saved as text file and later be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflate is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take a long last and a high CPU load after moving. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of photo bubbles, by selecting a small paint volume on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear extension to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a common operation, but also a very underestimated tool to allocate a picture. to make a photo you have to create a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. as a result, you will make a good overview as your photo will look after cutting. a new rectangle can create by using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the access point, use the button The Cutting button of the image processing in toolbar and the photo is added (Ctrl; + X). use File As Save or File As in the File menu to save the newly allocated photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the Preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialog, remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool following a aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as high-format or landscape format. in high-format it is always assigned to the larger value of the height and in the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool for aspect ratios uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same as regardless of whether you can use centimeter, Inch or any other physical size. for example, you can see a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below, you can set the max. relationship button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool following a aspect ratio undercut its settings depending on the image-orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool, these settings are stored as default value in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data are reflected in the image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly assistance may include help, so that you can assemble your pictures. these are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. such as the third-rule, harmonic triangles are a way to aligned a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division divided into various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaf blades a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it has been used with ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you assemble your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci row 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618. a composition that is usually follows as a visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides liquid aid lines when you merge a painting. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. in comparison to third-rule, the golden spiral is generating a liquid line of the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">"" "" "" "a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spirituals, also called gold rectangles. these rectangles have been used to guide the eye to the focal point of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this can be just as one without the eye to guide, it will accomplish his job." ""</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derive from the above mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, gold triangles are not equalled to the triangles. diagonal to these lines can be a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to set up your frame, create a effect of the professional photographer's dynamic symmetry. try to place your photo focus on one of the crossings and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal mirror and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonious backups.</seg>
<seg id="660">Using the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. on this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things have turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digial settings; press the right rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slide are set in degrees. using the button preferences, you can reset the push back on 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">At your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line to position. after moving it over an important point of the picture, you can affix it with a print on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is the function transformers out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Alignment option smooths the picture a bit after rotation. however, observe the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out to be a fixation point in the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the upper left: displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the top: displays the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly contaminated. for a single adjustment, this effect is small but two adjustments generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the prospect, you get relatifying triangular holes on the corners. one way to follow this is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The ignition tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part in the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformer scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Push your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical corners. if you press preferences, the angle can be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">At your help a vertical and a horizontal line are inserted. move the mouse to an important point, such as the Lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the line. you can now adjust the toolbox to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have done the calibration, the picture becomes a bit scanned. for a single shooting, this effect is often negligible, but two shrinkages are caused twice as much cheering and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shooting, the image has a beautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut out the image with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digial; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images from your system and, in some cases, from what kind of libraries are compiling from. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digial.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphs; is a KDE program for viewing & graphit; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI-program to visualize graphics. the programs that & graphviz; includes, are linked to the program author and X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few features.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kart viewer; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphics surface with all features of a well-integrated & kde; program to replace.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphs; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. & graphs; displays are free layout programs. & graphics viewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well-integrated & kde; program in a modern and user friendly & GUI. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & konqueror; (such a change in the graph in & Kate; it is a graph recomputed and graphed in & kart viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphene in & Kate; open or to open the graphs in & kgraphs; in a & Kate; -Component</seg>
<seg id="730">Download large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than this nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphs; is a & kde; program that preplaces & graphit; -tool & dot; for presentation of graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the open graph, each in a separate window. at the beginning, when you start & kgraphs; without a argument, the tool bar is open as the icon file and the (empty) list of last open files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have one or more & dot; files selected, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview will be displayed in the corner if Graph's Graph tab is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position in this overview with the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right at pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is restricted in both directions with a factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file is currently in & kgraphs; loaded file from another program, the following window will be shown:</seg>

<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can permanently save your choice but also change them with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">In program start, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph will be split up to multiple sites. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using several pages, you can select whether the parts of the graph will be on one page, and the aspect ratio will be ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by different parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The site Erneut store gives the ability to specify the behaviour, if a file has changed on the hard disk, and eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page opening provides the ability to specify the behaviour of & kgraphs; if a graph will be opened outside of a running session. you can open a default behavior for this case (the graph in a new window or in a window of the already running session) or determine that each time is in demand.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; -Algorithm is the standard for non-erized graphs. in this way, the Kamada-Kawai-Algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm created for unchecked graphs a springspring model layout. it uses the Fruitman-Reingold-Heuristik, and includes a multi-shredhead for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm rearrange the knot circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese in 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog, where you can specify a layout command, which is then carried out by a shell. the command should give the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can give & eg; - algorithms specify special options, or also the graphs with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization is available to locate images of geographically in spherical coordinate system that is used by GPS and Galileo. altitude, longitudinal and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML-file in the GPX format. GPSBabel and gpsone can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Choose the pictures you wish to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to upload a possible correlation through time and localization, you must download a trace file with GPX file, of course data that have been recorded in the same time as images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, the coordinates is performed in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore must be converted to GMT time. this can be done with the time zone. use the time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum deviation for the maximum time variance is the maximum deviation for GPS time and camera-time. the deviation among them are merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have any trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all the pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options of interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have a suitable data. if you know that in reality a location difference between camera and GPS, you can place these limits and press the button correlate to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same location. since the dialog you use the coordinates to the next notice, you only have to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map and can be found. in addition, select this region and increase the corresponding precision. the map must always be selected manually. the map can be always picked manually. the map can be changed manually between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to mount GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages. you can select the albums created as HTML pages. the character set will be coded for HTML pages. the character set will enable UTF-8 to enable the binding internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. these albums are not allowed to select any of these albums. the albums are not hierarchically displayed. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below is the Albenchpreview and the text that will appear in the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider aspect defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is mostly explaining a page. if you click on a picture a new page will be displayed in the image. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images. select a folder with the name KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG File Format, the EXIF data of your original images are also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the standard color depth. it naturally affects the file size. all other settings are explicable.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Reiter thumbnails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for the thumbnails, which are small images that will be displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press off break down the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has generated the pages, the window will not be shut down. therefore, you can click to display whether error occurred during production. the web browser will automatically display at the end to preview the preview pane. press the module to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allowed it to view a selection of images and perform on them basic operations such as screenshots, zooming or shifts. the viewer can be used with short-hand and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG - loss-free module is a tool to change images without blocking your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows for the actions listed below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage it is the file size rises, since there is no compression of the color formations taking place. this can be found e.g. in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-click is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera-click currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Teams under kde-imaging @ ked. note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI metadata editor now has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from a picture to another. then, select the import function to which you want to copy the target picture, so the picture to which you will copy the metadata. the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in a diazau format.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected image to a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slides.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled on the correct size for the selected video format. additionally you can create a background color for the slide show. with this module, it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You need to select the images that are packed into MPEG Diashau. after that, you can create via Extras MPEG Diaschau to start the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected from you are then listed in the portfolio. there, you can also change sorting the images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you are planning to re-create the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds which is displayed in seconds. a lower value produces very sudden, a high contrast is very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. name and path of created file can be determined under the name of the MPEG-output file. if possible, keep the extension.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the film. after you can start all settings your wishes, you can quickly or enjoy a coffee in all the rest and enjoy the diets if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, then you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on one sheet paper together in standard photogram. this is e.g: useful to improve or print on with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your files stored in one of three formats to JPEG, TIFF, or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: don't expect the same results as the software of your camera carrier. sometimes you get better results with dcrawler.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to convert and run the module. the Raw-Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. using this button you can preview the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides, if the camera settings can be adjusted for the white balance. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can continue to edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera has no effect in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and the filename remains immediately and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG is using a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to use your pictures frequently or later, you should not use the JPEG format, as it is only allowed a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that are stored in the RAW file are stored in the EXIF data in the JPEG file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, start the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process, you can also use Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, this is helpful to automatically overwrite the file. however, this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt. a preview pane indicates how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the image file from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of one album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several pictures of a picture collection. it uses the image of images from ImageMagick Pack. you can make the image smaller or larger. in addition, four types of image change will be provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image will be automatically selected, depending on image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio will be changed during this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, marginal size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. there is also possible to change the size of the deselect pictures before. more pictures can be moved on the list of selected images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures will be shown with the images displayed by you. via the button pictures you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the recently selected image will be shown a preview on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images on the picture list and add the list of images to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures you will remove the selected pictures from the list of selected images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open all your e-mail click with button OK. you have to add just the addresses and the subject line. the pictures selected from you are attached below.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't be sure to send many images at one time. most e-mail accounts are constraints for the size of sending e-mails. there is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and once again used until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Choose your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must have to install the Gmail Agent on your computer before download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a set-out file the comments will be added to the images in a text file.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adjusted among the lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG pictures file format and select the original files in JPEG format, then the original extifdata will be added to sensitive images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut you up in search of errors. your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. using the button, you can shoot this window? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module's advanced diazau you will want to see a window with questions like you want your slide show. you can select between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions in the presentation use very elegant picture processes using OpenGL. however, you have to own a corresponding graph card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename of filename ensures that the filename of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. then you can manually cancel the menu with Esc; Cancel reply.</seg>
<seg id="889">The pictures randomly select that the images are shown in random order. so the order of images will not be used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">In delay between the pictures, the temporal distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should, so, before you show the presentation to your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There is more than a dozen transition effects that you can choose from. accidental chooses a different effect during each transition.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a tool bar at the upper left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar, you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the diazau.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left, you can see the current filenames, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI Module is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Teams under kde-imaging @ ked. note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the current selected image, depending on the selected option of the menu, as background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have signed your pictures and videos with remarks, you can use & photo album; through these browses, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the image, in people, places, and in group keywords items are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories, for which you have entered information as you have entered information and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look at EXIF data to look at your hard disk and of course the current views of view.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse to the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images will be displayed on which both persons are visible. by this selection method, you can retrench the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, places and other settings, you can view images to view the images of your area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name. you can save with & PhotoAlbum; however, for each person has their own view, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined itself. see also the image.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images beside the name, select the button, which is located right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category. it has the advantage that you can display them e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of sample words (if you don't have any appropriate pictures).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to specify which image will be displayed for each individual person. in order to view this, you have to select the image for each individual. here you can select the image for the corresponding person. in the image window, you can select the magnification factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image will be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you are in the main window to search the entry, you will see a dialog, which is very similar to dialog for fixing the image properties. this dialog you can see on the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the field label or description, the labelling and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text, for example, you can also enter a date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, as for example 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the pictures according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, however not Anne Helene is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read handbooks, but rather try to test functions, you have the following alternatives to this handbook:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go on the homepage of & PhotoAlbum; and take a look at the quick, the screens and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photo album; and in the first dialog, choose the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; go to the first time, or choose the menu entry / photoalbum. you'll get some example pictures and you can test the functions of & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you'll find it on the homepage of & PhotoAlbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & clphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar is shown here: as the name suggests, this lad will show you data stats about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time line can display you several different time units. every LEICA shows a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture, you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactively used on the following ways: you can select the displayed items preview view from the database (if you select a date, the time frame will always be displayed in the preview window) and the time bar displays the current date displayed when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by holding the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time line, i.e. the time data, so the time indication is displayed. if you select a range, you'll cancel the selection only by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& PhotoAlbum; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, you can create the software in & photo album, which you can create via the HTML menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages have to be created, you have to make some settings. these are split into the three areas of content, layout and destination.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on photo album; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & photo album is created; export file will be created on the viewing site. if you can find information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information can be displayed on HTML pages. so, for example, all images from a party are obvious. for example, all images from a party are obvious. for example, all pictures from a party. note that this setting is not used to hide certain pictures from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the settings are clear, which is why not specifically made.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the site, you can set different resolutions for the images. this way, those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution of 800x600, no more images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer you can change the resolution at any time you have laid down. he can then browse your pictures with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time, browse if he wants to see a picture larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, you specify the various folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, choose a basic file for all of your HTML files, and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved. this folder will be saved and next time you can select the memory location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a KDE supporting protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if the URL is created for a URL, a web browser after the pages have been created. if you select a URL, you should select this folder. otherwise, the web browser should start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created from you are not yet in the final destination folders you need to manually copy it manually. this is the import function to specify the final goal of the files. this is not the subfolder of the files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders can be found.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just setting options have shifted all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will create, whose name you can define into output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're looking forward to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may, of course, want to add a HTML page to view the images. you can, of course, have a lot of time to view the images, shooting location, etc., you will have to do this job yet again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & PhotoAlbum; you can export a copy of your pictures to a .kim file. you can import them into your database. the image characteristics are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the file, or if the file is only a shortcut to save images. the advantage of all pictures in the file is that you can share all the pictures and this file is so independent. the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for two times. first the images are not found in the folder of the .kim file. this is, of course, searches, if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can export via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act as internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">To manually copy the Manually to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copy the copy of the .kim file, copy & photo album; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are regular Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it's usually not willing to compress the files so you simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limit maximum image size. if you don't want to send your friends pictures, since the .kim file would not be very big. here you can limit the size by allowing for example that each image will be up to 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you import a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file Import..., & photoalbum; import database files as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you can personalize the category people who are importing too importing file staff (if you are a domain), while this category should be imported in the third dialog box, which categories of the imported file are to be imported and what categories comply with these in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can get the categories of the imported file using the categories of your current database. an example for this is to be seen on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you want to watch pictures from different image groups and see a picture with your friend on it, you may wish to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you'll find the different steps (1) Festing information about your pictures, through (2) searching and watching, through (3) advanced themes and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. it was extended and today, it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this handbook it is talked about images, but often it includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& PhotoAlbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copying to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; remember the folder, where your pictures are stored and uses this in future Starts. if you want to start a different folder with images, you can start a different folder with images. for example: photo album -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings for photo album; set up... to a window with which you can change the settings of & PhotoAlbum; in the following section of the user manual you will be explained by different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "on the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can access the preview options and the options for the viewer. for each attitude you can call for a detailed assistance to the F1 button and click on the desired option." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described you how to set different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog, which is used to edit already existing groups. for any existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up whole membergroups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all groups of a member.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the settings that you are available for taking the list of members. in the left-list box you can select the category. in the left window hemisphere you can configure the list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& PhotoAlbum; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image plug-in interface. find information on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by several applications, it may be possible to test the modules with & photo album; you should always test new modules with the command &gt; kphotoalbum / demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI can be very different, so it can be that some modules with & photo album; not work. this is the downside if you share features with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The greatest difference between & PhotoAlbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their images in albums: this kind of order is not supported for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">"" "the album" "" "simulates & PhotoAlbum" "" "; the current album, which meets the current view, thus shows all images that shows you the picture preview." ""</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, & photo album; the modules also have a list of albums. here are & photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser displays the content of a category, for example all persons, then every entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or there will be the category you've specified in the settings dialog by category for virtual albums, for example, if you are using the category persons, will & cphotoalbum; so do, so whether you have chosen to add people to view this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of the modules. start the settings dialog, and choose which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you can start & photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the window that you can browse through your image. at the moment, you don't have any information about your image databases. in the section we will not show you any information about your pictures. in the section we will see you at this window, which shows you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photoalbum; this is the possibility to see each image with remarks. this includes information about the persons, which is shown on the picture, or for a larger number of pictures, may be shown simultaneously. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browses, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In you can see three lists with a text box by selecting persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & photo album; as you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the shift of images within the list: for example, if you have a family party, and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people are shown, so that the names used up are postponed to find persons more quickly and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click the symbol for sorting after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each picture, you may wish to edit all the selected images and add these images with notes. simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the upper right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and California are all in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is a special symbol, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In context menu of the note dialogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also make an entry into a category and place there in order to make this entry into a subcategory. attention, this assumes that you are currently sorting out your categories.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the note dialogs by form the vest that the upper edge of the frame form, click and move. you can also make your own window by moving it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the layout of the window so to your needs, click on the button Options... that allows you to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also view a frame completely. if you want to see this window later again, use the button options... and then window a / out window. this process will see you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you are looking to view images in your browser, you'll get an overview with thumbnails at the currently selected pictures, or all images you can't see the thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse with the middle button on the mouse, follow it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the back of your desktop, this picture will be set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this image viewer will be displayed. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the imagery. simply select the images from which you want to delete and press the menu Edit menu. now, select the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& PhotoAlbum; you can also use this problem for this problem. you can also use & kphotoalbum; you can also use images anywhere you can find on your hard disk. in the picture, you'll have to view the images anywhere in the database. in the picture you can see the view of & PhotoAlbum; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, on which the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. for the pictures 5-9, the images are displayed; for the pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are displayed; you can also view these images from the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, you need to copy this function to copy files from folders and copy them back to the CD. if you want to avoid anger, how to avoid henceering your pictures, please buy a bigger hard drive to store all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to remain a little more privacy you want to watch the pictures so that you may want to see for others unaccessible and click on current view, you can also see all the pictures you want to see for everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">In this case, you have laid out what images should be hidden in the case of your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, making all the pictures you have blocked, hidden out. if you want to see the images again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">"" "" "" "it is also possible to specify a password which needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set this password, simply select password in the menu" "" "menu" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="992">Please note that this picture protection is not very secure. for one of these images on the hard disk and to the other, everyone can access the file index.xml, which allows you to read out the password as uncoded text; not very familiar to deny the look to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can spend all your pictures with & photo album; manage and hours talk about hours that you want to look at some point. for this reason, & photoalbum. this is why you can preview them from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in. it shows course the picture, but additional all information you have shown on the image, like who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox is on the top part of the picture you can see, so you can easily configure what information is displayed and elsewhere. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. so the appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here if you click on Anne Helene, the browser doesn't show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you have chosen persons from the browser and then Anne Helene would have chosen.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several pictures at the viewer you can jump between them and return by using the buttons (high and picture). you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer you can run this as a slide show. then you can get a new picture after a few seconds. how often a new picture can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus the diets by pressing Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability to view & photoalbum. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire room on screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can go into the picture and go out into the picture. with the mouse button you can rezoom out the Plus button zoomt into the middle of the picture. showing how a Zoom rectangle is marked and displays the result of ZOOMS.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not zoomed. with the equation, the ZOOMS is set to ZOOMS, so that every pixel is equivalent to a pixel image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that only zoomoperations are working with videos that are in and out-zooming with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can turn the images from the context menu. this doesn't work with videos. you can make remarks on the current image from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you have seen pictures, you can take a picture with a person whose name you may have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can check the picture and configuration dialog of the picture to mark this name. but you will be able to mark the picture and see more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to see what photos you want to start on paper. to see what photos you want to start with the pictures and see them as good or bad, while you see one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer will give you the opportunity to view images with characteristics when you view them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that press the appropriate letters. in view, see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these will be available in your browser. so you can see all the pictures you want, print or whatever you have chosen, so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and characteristics can be displayed in the view view. if you show categories in Dre preview, then you can press features to the images, simply press the characters for the feature, after the image has been selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you are allowed to paint & photo album; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted box will not be saved with the image but in the database. on the way you can reverse your mixture later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In view, you can see a picture on the painted. to switch on the painting mode from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply put the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the icon Rendering The icon Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry to the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A RENDER mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini-files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can specify as many RENDER modes, from a fast preview up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The RENDER or the toolbar icon or in the menu View RENDER modes... the following dialog is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each RENDER mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets you recognize the mode of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size, you can add the width and height of the blender image. if you wish to render only a small area of the image, select the check box below and enter the picture section to rendering the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can select the properties that use & Povray; you can use a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the RENDER features can be found in the user manual at & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rotated with only one ray each pixel, there may be different mistakes. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or stuceffects in curves and lines, besides, details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally, pictures look better with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connect to Povray; this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as default is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive, because every pixel are always split up and adaptive, because every pixel is continually expanding and adaptive by the calculated value of the calculated color value.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray rejects a ray pixels, then both pixels will be adjusted to the given threshold of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 points will be charged with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 Rays per pixel. if the difference between the colours, the pixels will be divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be followed individually and to further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recess is set up with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it is calculated very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this cardboard box, you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the proper rays have no object taken.</seg>

<seg id="1077">So you have just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start with no more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you can create the ultimate scene in this guide, you should be very popular among beginners: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should read the following warnings carefully before you complain that you are only using a black screen. if you use a 3D program, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert a light source, your whole scene lies in the dark and you will only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. please read the documentation so that you can expect an appropriate performance what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to remove this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry Edit. so you can now see a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-top view shows how the camera views the whole scene, which you create. in particular, check the scene from the camera's fourth wire-top view (see right below). this is the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new record with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the content of the object properties properties in which the various parameters of the camera will find. in the user documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything in the basic settings of the camera, but you can change the camera in view points, with which you can change the camera in view points, with which you can change the focus of the camera. just click on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you are pressing the button or press the space button, the wire-model views and the object tree are readmitted accordingly to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could set a Quader (Insert your body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that's a comprehensible method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as bottom:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plane in the object tree, change the name and press the button call or the space bar. in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view also displays the level, although at the moment only as a limited infinite. when you renew the scene, the level stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you are looking to see the object tree exactly, you will find that you can open the following parameters for each new object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the list of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should get the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, so you can get some of these parameters. choose shifting and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the ground to introduce its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a few times in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog box will open where you can select how the object should be inserted. please select the name in the property tree. you can see the name in the self-view (name = ground pigment), with one click on the button you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment only shows a matt black material, because you can still enter the layout of materials at any time with a click on preview. enter the colors for the pigment. also, there are many options again, but now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">"" "if you don't see any color on Quader and ball in the preview, just click on the button and then call the preview." ""</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you renew your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, you are not the Farben. which you have expected. in the color list, you have to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree jedesmal font color and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already simply run this step, because you have already understood the basic working methods of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. put the value for a radius: on 1 (don't forget to press the space or press the button), so the ball contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball will float above the ground, since you have shifted the floor for a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the Rendering now gives a strange result: as already seen before, the ball out appears like a matt black material. put on the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material as already in the ground, give the ball a pigment than color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first object and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on ball pigment, then select insert and set the values like this:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can get more interesting effects when taking time to adjust some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen shots and click on Apply button or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings brightness and reflection are already visible in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what ways you can & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much, which you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a RENDER method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the rendering hypothetical rays comes from the perspective of the viewer. the RENDER is calculated and has broken the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as an atmospheric effects, such as nebula. so, the scene is adapted for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see a camera without watching the camera. without a light source you see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>

<seg id="1126">It's common to use the same file for a bump-map as well as for texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body is simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens of or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>

<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings for collection. note: & Amarok; will change your collection automatically as soon as you own something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the tool bar is a search filter. it behaves right in the list view as well as in the tree view. references to use this movie can be found in the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a drop down menu, with its help you can filter the lastly added pieces to your collection. you can also choose different time windows from the last 24 hours to a year. besides, you can also select your total collection so that the filter is practically shut off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you get the following options.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Change a compilation selection - Change the record marketed album back into a normal album. then the album will no longer be displayed under the associated interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser is quite easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist page contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even even intelligent playlists are possible. click on smart playlists to open the dialog for creating a new intelligent playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired title from the playlist and drop them on the list. if the transfer is complete, you'll end the pieces on your iPod. when the transfer is complete, you'll end the drive train for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the tool bar, there is a search area where you can search for a file. search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you can get a address box, with which you can get music from a given URL. if you like for example, tar: / home / mike / music .tar.gz can now access to music in the file. you can now let the music from there enter the playlist and let it drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is more than in the window, the trailers of files can be very difficult. in the case, the drop-up of the Shift key can be helpful: in this case, dropped files will be inserted at the end of the list, and not at the base position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist can be loaded all of you to the playlists. you can enter the order by entering the mouse to the desired position and drop out. over the playlist, you will only enter the pieces that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the way back, until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search terms and search by spaces; search for entries, search for entries, search all entries, will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>

<seg id="1391">If you are looking for entries to search for entries, then join the search term with geese: Mike Oldfield. after entries are searched for entries, not as Mike Oldfield, but for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for bigger or small. for example: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you are looking for a piece that does not include a specific keyword, sign a minus sign before the keyword: -some searches for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations following each other. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this is looking for all things that either Mike Oldfield included, or having a higher rating than 50 and not the comment bath included.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the query string of entries by press the CTRL key, and then with the right button of mouse click on the entries you will receive a mark with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played.</seg>

<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface that can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>

<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then add files into the new folder:</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudioat; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data into WAV files on the hard disk) and by many co-files that these WAV files will need to be installed as from the Linux distribution (if they have been installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD are read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">Are in a second step of these WAV files (usually one per title) compresses in the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading out & CD; it is used by & kaudioat; cdparanoia is used. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this has not yet been installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggpre (for OGG) or other encoders have already been installed, so it is probably not necessary to compile it yourself. however, it is not necessary to install anything itself. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While arranging only one time (the setup dialog has to be performed so often until a suitable configuration is found), after a suitable configuration, it will be explained to the comprehension of a single & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble on the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudioat; with different card cards (like Encoder, to set the Encoders). you must go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes key quality, encoding and compression ratios and helps with choosing the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'Monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes today a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences will generate much less important, as both encoders are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is supplied with most distributions for free, but no open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (for high bit rates), but compared to OGG mild quality in deeper bit rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG billing is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, harddisk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR Joint Stereo, compression rate about 11.128 kbps for all pieces of a track. good pleasure for music by youngsters, portable devices and autoostereods. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely don't want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that can be entered manually or exported by the program automatically from FreeDb via the Internet, are available as a list of parameters. you can transfer / used to create folders and file names as well as the features of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with co-programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or assistance to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title; if MP3s can be coded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudiores must be added; the result looks as follows: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioat; parameters which can be used (= button labelling in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDb is: to read / enter the audio CDs that you can download / enter the information, so that all others can download it instead of yourself in the calculator. it is to be aware that only the text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc; not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the ubership): it's not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is no one or less worthless, so the information can be added to the music company damage. all information can be used anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioat; it is active a check box (sending an address). for the use of FreeDb, it can be used with another (fake) address as the system used in the system. in this kind of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used by calling the server (this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. when using FreeDb, the geographic column should be used to use FreeDb. this saves a bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org offers a current list of reflections for the online delivery of & CD; you can download the complete database, or (usually monthly created) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reader program is used to save pieces from CD & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used to do it, search in the source code.... It was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this has not been done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the selected WAV files, the encoding and the desired file format can be selected. when opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on the tab card to set up the code. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The code package must be installed from the Linux distribution to be installed before the Kodierer can be used. this is also required for the predefined codiers. further information on Kodiers are in the section Welfare Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many reasons. check the device name for the CD; / DVD drive, the writing and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;), try to run both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could be a clue on what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will make enough information to set up those areas which you want to do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to create everything and our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sample words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages to your Linux distribution. at least, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you have screaming on it (eg; by copying something into the conjuncor).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers basic configuration of & kaudioat; something which is probably being done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the advance to read a & CD; what is to be repeated for each issuing & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the using code for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224-256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the program running FreeDb to download the CD & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with any issue of a & CD; change if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is delivered to the reading program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link on the real device name of your disk. if this doesn't work or if more than one CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed, so helps a view to the file / etc / fstick and an attempt to use there available entries for CD-ROM and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card General Settings. there's no much to do. here you can specify an additional conversion. in our example, everything will be shown so clowdown / typed as shown in screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, so you will be informed if data are missing to testify to keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and allow the & CD; data will be automatically downloaded via the Internet from a FreeDb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during reading the & CD; connected to the Internet, so he can access the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop down is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you are unhappy with the database record and the resulting directory names / filename or tag records, they can easily change. the directory or filename is changed with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to enter all manually, select the selection box and FreeDb will not use it. however, this is more than 620 MB large, it is worth considering whether this is worthwhile to use it. at least the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDb. this is Settings for the Data Inquiry, For the Call of the FreeDb Server via the Internet. how does the system know which data will be received via FreeDb. read the section about FreeDb. do everything as shown in screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and looking to a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way, the load will be distributed between the computers. however, this setting will work as the first try.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, but there are more luck with the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data to the FreeDb server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from screen shot. (make sure that folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously irregulating pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time when using only an existing drive? does not know the author, so it's just trying.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading out the last piece: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you are crossing the folder, then the path / folder can be specified when only space on another drive is available. if the field is not checked, the files will not be checked if you want to do this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything as shown on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under any circumstances have to be blinded to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned earlier, it is sufficient for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is approximately 224-256 kpbs. the reached compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Notice the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted if needed. in the event of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in screen shot. some comments for future use just outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously coded WAV files: with a DualCore or Quad-core or even a multi-processor machine, more than one WAV file can be decode simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is what we have just finished the basic furnishings of & kaudioat; this configuration is used as standard for each reading a & CD; if you have smart the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, as the process of reading the & CD is described, we have created MP3 files. the folder structure is based on the Internet, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from FreeDb is going to be picked up. the process of which is described in this section has to be repeated for each issuing & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD; you don't have a little bit different than that for one & CD; with successfully out of FreeDb. so you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually, instead of accessing them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; you can find this example. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not been done, now the & CD has to be put into the drive window, which has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in screen shot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; identifies and can be read from cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done then you are searching for questions and answers by help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "attention: if the & CD has been picked up successfully by the FreeDb, all tracks of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there's a window appears, and you can select the database entry that fits best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query by FreeDb (on page & CD;) you can also choose this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but you will need the internet connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot, the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the input field 'Current titles' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for each comments on inidivinell per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the FreeDb data, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD-editor, so you can not only check with the artist and album names (for example whether all words are beginning with big letters or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioat; maximum allowed. this option will have a look at the Tab's Settings section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all codes or file formats. check in the aid to the Kodierer in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, which obviously incide with the style of outgoing CD; this is not important as we give the & CD; data anyway. for more information, go to the website of freedb.org and read information about the categories. pop or Rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors will be back again and you will see that the fields for the album are already recorded with the entered data, which we have entered for the first piece. simply enter the items of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from the FreeDb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the part list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected will be read out. just a simple click on the line switches or use the button to select all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection out the reading process, this window appears to be confirmed. then click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and how it runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab on the tab on the job window. it's in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you are trying to work with a Kodierer, which you have not installed yet. pieces that were not successful with a red 'X' in the order list are marked.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target file are not what we typed here in the example. have you tested if you have typing on the folders for temporary files and the target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 in the format MP3. therefore, read and code in parallel. notice the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behaviour. the only thing that seems configurable using the number of parallel processes is unclear. the used calculator with an AMD64 seems to have no problem during simultaneous reading and encoding (of however, two different parts).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while a different piece is coded and a third order in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioat; you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoding of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are played by the series. in this section, you can use the collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find in the menu collection under the Point Organize.... Click here on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then the name for the new collection. this collection will be included at the beginning the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the defendants at the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When applying the application this collection is not stored. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to add a song in the collection manager. there, in turn, you can add a song by using the button. it will appear in turn you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection, a piece will be added when opening (using file opening or drag & drop) to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When upgrading to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece is activated and emptied the temporary collection, the collection will then be added to the open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must select the collection manager, select the collection and the required song and then click Removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played out. if you select the series after playing the menu, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list on the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To continue to jump a song, choose the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow button right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song to jump back, select the button previous piece, the entry predicted piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection of the collection and click the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">Temporary collection can't be dropped. however, this doesn't matter as it does not appear when leaving & kmid; it's not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General-MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events in events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thereby can be played a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no software to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications of playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP message, which may appear as often as desired. but it is necessary that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; assist you for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches from General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that GM cartridge will not change in the right order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that you don't need to play on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which is like a gun shot. to do so, do the following in the PATCHMAP message:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (fabric shooting down), it takes you patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the concept drum-patch of the patch is meant, for each note a different type of percussionists (drum, basins, maracas & etc;) is not the one that means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a given channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP message, the sequence of lines is very important, as their presence. you have to generate 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are mainly used to form notes on the perkussions channel. look at the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to transfer some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, make it easy for CHANNELMAP.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have percussion on a given channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP message has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, you will need to use the keyword name for this channel. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this canal. in this case, always Patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the perversions patch on the perkusy channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates the value of Pitch bender events. if so, a MIDI file is converted with the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the Map file will not be decimal (decimal).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM will be used to play a keyboard, which will play a tone higher with the value 4096, to play a tone higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find them in the menu on Settings, Point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole number of claviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on this manual, you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a given channel. for each channel there is a select list where you have changed a tool, the button is no longer green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views, in order to view the played tones below the point canalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD shows the speed in which a song is played, the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a music piece. it contains notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. this allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to be very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't vibrate, & kmid; however, a typical MIDI file needs approx. 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror; select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Enable the automatic add to the collection before adding. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can double-click the arrow keys from the speed button to slow the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & Konqueror; desktop with my MIDI file and & kmid; in this way I must play when the collection should be played at the end or I want to play a file simply into the & Konqueror; window, and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn the automatic add to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection of opening files.</seg>
<seg id="1692">For example, suppose you have to play the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid.. just imagine the automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! when I hear these songs or see the postcard I animates that, further to & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and layout and content of the Featuresaloges, the & quantitative; for the day shows the rules and information of the & DTEP; itself. tool bar enable a fast insertion of tags in a document without a risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing but folder. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the read language and version, so existing. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declared if they are necessary, or not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in the individual. everything about the possibilities and limits will be displayed in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only element type, nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>

<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog is to be presented above in & quantum leaplus; windows to start and checked TagXML. a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. however, the verification takes place only when loading the TagXML files in & quanta lus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Following an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this day XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2026">A action can be set up with Settings... Create. click New Action for the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion is assigned to the keyboard. by clicking the User Defined, a shortcut can be assigned; with a button the current shortcut is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the Detect settings and in the execution of this action, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action styp. using this action you can use external applications (usually scripts, but it's not limited) to change the document or use it as input (or parts of document). even the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First you need to specify the script and the interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paws are allowed, it is recommended to find the% scriptdir. $KDEDIR / share / scripts / apps in its path: $PATH / share / apps in its path: $PATH There are other specific variable, which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in the event of a local document file file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantum-lus; only one instance works, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantitative; external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the included methods, a script can be evaluated by & quanta lus; at the default input. in the selection box, you can determinate what is to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected part of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "according to the input, the output of the" "" "application" "" "application can also be redirected. there are two types of output, written to the standard issue; error messages can be done to the standard issue, by default the value is set out:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. in any case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the marker.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the day attributes has and you are planning to activate a dialogue "day" when available, so that a input when using this promotion is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should note the action in conjunction with this symbol? if we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & kmenu;, graphic other programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 3x32 pixel as standard, but we need 22x22 to change this, select Edit sizes.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol is not only helping you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard that the tag start is called, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as less, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least be signalled, this symbol is a & lt; starting the day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantum aplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and put them away with other tags, so there's still which, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantiaplus; functions to tool bar, or it should set this for better overview through some separators in several groups. make sure the tool bar is selected among settings. make sure the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (on top left) for my tool bar. after choosing the element to be added to the tool bar, press the arrow keys to the right. this adds to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview quick access to the Conqueror Preview. I will select it and add to tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar might believe that the & Konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by trying all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be created imbal folder but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the proper folder, so that their tool bar (s) will be loaded if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the mentionable extension of & quanta lus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatification language that you like most. therefore this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could test & quantiqulus; -Repository if anyone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we'll need to let the first part we treat you.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = pfone, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations e.g. # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec1.html-1 = tag1.html-2 = tag.html-3 = tag.html-3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in documentation. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation so much as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level Elements Top element = PHP 4.2, # Getting started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Basic syntax = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax = basic syntax = basic syntax .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # vor Getting started and Language Reference. that shows that it is a subfolder in a tree with its own content. there is no known border for chess telegraph (except by reason) mdash, but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced to a file (and consistent on the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative; resourcendfiles will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section of docrc _ fetch _ array function is designed for example when writing a & PHP; scripts written for the mysql _ fetch _ array function, the documentation should be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context menu (ContextList) and the file connecting lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of two separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">You can now save your file docrc directly to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quantity / apps for local and global use. then create a folder (as if you have docrc) in the same folder as docrc, and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this well and worth it is to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation is used to use by the & quantitative; -Repository for use by the & quantitative; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have been working on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative aplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners, or else who will be sent. at different places, there's an e-mail menu including DTD DTD package (DTD) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archives, from where all other & quantius; -users can download it and only available when our team needs them as correct and useful for publishing, it is guaranteed to make use of a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources guarantees, for our team as well as for future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have completed multiple keys. in the dialog New Resource, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can be empty) and with clicking OK the Upload will start.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can also instantly upload the toolbar DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbar, and can be started in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installing, investigate & quantifungus; in the case of problems, it may be canceled. if the integrity have been given correctly and the resource is correctly signed, a notification appears with the stating the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work with XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantitative assessment; however, it may be time consuming, because hundreds of day files can be needed in everyday XML format. there's the easier way to convert DTD automatically into an DTD package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The transformation can be started from the DTD command and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name written in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>

<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & quantitative; after converting the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantum-lus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and full benefits from & quantiaplus; therefore, one must first create these concepts at first, without their understanding and quantiaplus; little benefits brownish.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative assessment, the operating range is divided into three areas: global, local and projection. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantum aplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who is quantiaplus; uses, available. from tool bar about actions, everything is marked global, in the joint file structure of & quantum aplus; this allows the group of administrators different toolbar, actions and samples in the global tree to ensure everyone in a multi-user environment at the system available.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are user specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be all done by & CSS; patterns up to tool bar with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emit the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantum-lus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editing Pane, the Baumania with information and toolbars. please beat in, and for detailed information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the right mouse button, to get an account menu with the current mouse-mouse button, such as close to the current, other or all cartoutraps, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS repositories to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right mouse prints lead to a further context menu on the edited documentation, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), processing under the mouse pointer or open the file, if the string indicates a file below the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editing window, the tool bar of the editor will be shown. at present the tool bar is shown as standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further expansion of tool bar, the tool bar is adapted to the new features and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"" "the use of tool bar is really light. if they want to insert a single day, e. g." "" "if you want to insert it into your document, then you can enter the data for this just added day. if you want to insert several attributes such as anchor, you can fill different fields in a dialog." ""</seg>
<seg id="2091">The installation views (QIT;) allow it to navigate to & quantitative; to navigate, they are able to open and through. in the presentation with flashes, documentation, project templates, documentation, attributes, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, the & quantitative tool. this view shows all files in the project and allows you to remove all files in the project using right mouse click. actions such as removing, removal, uploading or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of quantiaplus; it is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; There are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided in three categories, depending on what context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the user and templates in projects. more to templates is found in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of integrating in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can use the information available to a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script can be started to send or send by email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed on the position of the element. by the Right click of an element it will open a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other buildings. with it manquickly change attributes and namespaces. changing the content management system allows the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for the web technique for your development. there can be prepackaged documentation for & quantitative assessment; it can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be customized, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantum-lus; two cartoons at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the useful information system: the messaging window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This box leader features information about each in Quantum a running script. for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This box counter shows all errors in the startup of the current document. & quantum aplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so that exists) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitative; tool bar is extensive extended and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate-eite of tool bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantum aplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of quantiaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantum aplus; sends the toolbar as compressed air-archive over & Kmail; if they get a tool bar in an email, they can secure it & quantiaplus; like any others secure and charge!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantum aplus; for this, auto conf gives a number of options that can be handed to the configure script. to understand a complete list of options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you're having trouble when starting & quantitative; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. you should also make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH because of its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative aplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative Web development optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide variety of power functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quanta lus started to deal with a close idea: what if & quantitative; an independent, extendable Markup language editor would be? well, this would make it an absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done!</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, & quantum-lus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. together, if you can define it into & XML; it should be quantiaplus; it should be suitable & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to which the above needs must be noted that & quantum-lus; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community is based on why anyone else has developed? thanks to & kde; - odours is not just this all possible, it allows users and developers, & quantitative; so to expand as they need for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantum aplus; enables web development to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can be improved with virtually any task. by means of self-knitted promotions, scripts and toolbar; you can expand & quantiaplus, without any other scripting language.

<seg id="2115">A quick list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you can open a file that is not found on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for future use. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder, only a bug is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting from the clipboard there, special characters included, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert text from clipboard to & URL; - description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. it is primarily used to add & URL to the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection or off. it allows you to select text blocks with the help of & Shift.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; script will be error messages!</seg>

<seg id="2123">Evaluation and setting of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantitative; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the main window. this column allows you to put bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries and next, depending on the cursors location in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents will be grouped by the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantum aplus; projects are stored on the file .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the repository.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. it allows for copying device files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Charges the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded any input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes such as & quantitative; the project manages. in chapter & quantitative assessment, you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Charges a project tool bar. these are kept in repository / toolbars and are only available in this menu, if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens up a dialog to add a new tool bar. this created only the names. actions must be saved through Settings. tool bar are stored by toolbar toolbars or you will be asked if you want to store the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the sight. deletes it from disk. if you haven't saved the tool bar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">In order to send your own tool bar to someone (perhaps to the & quantitative; -team, so the tool bar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of tool bar to the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Charging a & DTD; you can or anything else made and convert to the & quantitative; own accord format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / remotely discharged of entities out of the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities out of the & DTD; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE file is not available, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a submenu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog, when there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tag, followed by & DTD; -specific undermentions.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated / activates the intelligent insert of tags. currently this works only with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quantitative assessment means that this day is contradicted by means of tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu, the available plugins listed above listed above listed below. click on a activated plug-in activates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Choose the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available application schemata depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-looking ID. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; tidy by external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, the changeover can sometimes need time or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the card display mode, which is also the default value, or the submenu mode, which is the representation in & quantitative; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open window. with selecting a job, the corresponding subwindows is activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantitative; main window, respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2151">Judge the behavior of the Editing window. in the documentation of & Kate. you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbar, or which add and change the series.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment's environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative aplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely lized, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantum; -development in financial form, find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self explanatory and should be completed the best from above, since example after the execution of the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project can be completed later with Shift; F7 project Properties are being adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, the file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantum aplus; -project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the repository.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine where you want to access, except one processes local data. either a name (hostname.exemplary .de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, default settings are used. depending on the setup, it could be necessary to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder, where the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative Path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files used for various projects, this folder should be configured instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder, where the tool bar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by standard toolbars. if a common collection of files used for various projects, this folder should be configured instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local filesystem into the project. several files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. at serverside scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go different.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Go-in, if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, if a project is based on new, not anniak.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed inside the folder and you can make a precise selection according to coupons.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hhaken or, by removing the tick, cloned out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded to the menu Properties in the Menübaum in the menu Profile or using the Shift Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings match those in the project assistants and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder), which are related to project related operations, such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, also files which are listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view that will be loaded during opening the project. in addition, more about project views can be read.</seg>
<seg id="2172">Thus, the required debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be configured using the Options button. in this case the debugger can be described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the window of profiles, high loading profiles (see in) can be configured (see in) as well as the display of a tree view for each profile by showing an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the windows configuration team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as an mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the submenu event configuration, you can change event actions and add these actions, change or delete actions. event reactions are executed if a particular event occurs, such as the Sheets of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, the quantiaplus opens; the last project, which was open, we can't influence this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select the project... from the Tools menu or the icon Project Open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If quantiaplus is closed, the project file will be stored automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantitative; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management offers free access to the files in the project. there, files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders can also act, but missing entries open and opening up with... in the right button of the mouse click on the button menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here, different profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button will disappear to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forget with programming. this possibility is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the record does not save in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantum-lus; many high-loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name, to which the files will be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this doesn't have to be changed, except the network administrator runs a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your rankshaft, this is either a time saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password will be stored on the plate, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">One project view is just a set of files and tool bar. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple numb of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the updated files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">The views can be stored in the project or the project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quanta lus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows modification of & quantitative; to their own working methods.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, tool bar in & quanta lus; best on the toolbar menu. use and add-in. the addition of tool bar is treated below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and symbols can be set on either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a new tool bar can be set to rename or toolbars, which can be displayed in the dialog, where actions may be displayed on this or other tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will remove action and action are displayed, that are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Toolbars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings for toolbars... and settings can be set...</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential document skeletons, code schnitzel and files to link. & quaplus; used templates as a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any existing folder to the system. templates have in & quaplus; in about the limitations which one imagines the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative templates; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are normally added in documents using global templates (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be made by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple framework for the purpose and organizes a simple framework to be efficiently. some examples can be found under global templates. see in for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is added on a template, but the same text area will always be included in the documents by a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are available in the template area under global templates. see in for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are for whole websites as templates. you are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder structure. currently there are no examples of quantiaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure following you (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As a template to save as local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has been done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File As a template to save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only in a file folder. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and insertion about the file tree of konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files tree view, select a name for the template and secure it. by default, it can be stored in the repository, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can create header lines and footer or dynamically with & PHP; create, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep some things in using projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the submenu templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps and $HOME / .kde / share / apps. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder you can click the folder with the right mouse button and to select the properties in context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded, as soon as terrestrial attributes is tact.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and suitable for everything except the regular file. if a regular folder would be adjusted, it would be explicitly activated in this path unless otherwise it would appear as if nothing appears, you'll probably be found in a trunk file.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allow preceding or presented text for templates in this folder. this might be general header and footer for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents to a folder with special header lines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have to include Context menu (on it, press right mouse button) to add folders or copy templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative aplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source Editor, which can be accessed via the menu View. the first mode replaces the editor-editor in two parts: the code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it displays a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and cursor appears. then you can edit and when needed to source code editor, in which the changes made in the source code are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor, on a document, which contains PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; it is still not possible to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode just works like the first one, except that at the same time the changes are displayed in the code editor and in the VPL; Editor is already active, this mode is already active when pressing the active cursor from one window to others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation interval between the VPL; -Editor and the source code Editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta.... In choosing VPL; you can automatically select between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation may be adjusted. basically, the recommendation is: a small range for fast calculator and a large range of fir for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing features can be selected using the VPL; Editor is also called, as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is also called, as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is also called for the reduction of the suspension code. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storage of information about the document itself, for example, keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key wort2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with buttons below the list or delete a change via the meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS styling by pressing the file button and choose the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is like in a word processing, by moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted by means of return or remodelaste.</seg>
<seg id="2225">"" "the insertion of tags will be made in the same way, as in the source code editor," "" "It is to be aware that the insertion of tags in previously existing exact tags cannot be removed, e.g. if a anchors day, surround with text, each other surrounding tag should be removed."

<seg id="2281">There are many graphics tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributions had been made and at the same time changed much text in many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result had numerous conflicts with merge.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no evidence on the places, where perhaps only the change had changed. the result of this change was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; able to display the differences in one line and changes to white characters. later many more useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to quickly compare text, copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and co-operation of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way merge will also be fully supported if two persons can work independently in one piece of cod and make changes in the original file. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the image photo shows three source files at the merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& diff3; also helps you to complete and merge to complete folder. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Kdiff3; displays the exact differences in terms of present colour monitors. if you often have to review cod, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in some number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the summary on the left side of the column on the left. (no longer if any one changes the recess.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other one differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can easily write the file by using only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Subfolder 1 folder 2 subfolder 2 subfolder 2 subfolder 2 subner1 folder 3 folders 3 folder 2 folder folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog enables manual typing of filename, selecting from the file browser (file...) or select a last open file from the drop-down list. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button file... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, select the same or merge file, for B and C, select a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When interfered, the input field is active for target and can be handled. however, it is not necessary to upgrade immediately a output file. you can also get this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can specify options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard. the comparison begins immediately. in opening dialog you do not have to select files, you can simply connect the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop off: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from a editor and let it fall on a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains a file such as many similar functions. if you'll need to figure out how similar these functions are, it would only have two relevant files to upload them into & kdiff3; now you can easily copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can remove any material from & kdiff3; only the release of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and lowering text into another program as outcrop and add-in (instead of copying and insertion). in such case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each word window, the information line contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that windows C is optional too long). (if the path is too long), leave the mouse for a while on the line. then a little relief window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, the default color is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links to the text, the column is displayed. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. among some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the merge column from the text, is interrupted at positions where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (in the comparison window) also has a info line with the inscription:, the filename and [readmore] when you have finished the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are disbanded, saving disabled!!! (use the buttons to next dissolved / unoccupied conflict for the remaining conflicts to find.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are to be used, every difference is also to be manually solved.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the first line of the group will be shown in all windows, and the first line of the group will be displayed in the windows. (this is also highlighted by the color background color.) This group will be highlighted by the color background color for the current section and each on the left will appear black bars.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no further line in the batch by automatic collision or by manual editing; it is only a placeholder for the case; it is only a placeholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps to another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, or in a marking which you might copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; summarization appears; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the results window. use cautiously with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignore the Options, ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the images and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. when you use in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys on, right, end, Strg-beginning and Strg-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. in addition, you can also click navigating to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window you can also use the other keys to edit. using the insertion key, you can switch between plug-in and transfer mode. (default is plug-in mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section merge and the editable output window was declared).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / former conflict (Ctrl-Down / Strg picture), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Figure), or to the next / previous conflict, even after manual release, therefore must be classified as conflict between dissolved and unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you have to automatically copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insert). if this option is activated, the option is carefully copied and manual copying. be careful with this option but you could accidentally write the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line inputs are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-in-feed type\, and Win32-based systems do not use the line splitting of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of last files used will automatically be saved during loading and re-established at the next start. (menu Insert &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a typeface with fixed width. (on some systems the dialogue also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but they should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italics are displayed. if the chosen font is not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered by default. on these systems the button will automatically set up an unjust colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, when pressing the tab button, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted. otherwise, a tabulator-character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or press Return, the insertion of the previous line will be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, any choice will automatically be copied to the clipboard. then manually copy the buffer to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In comparison of files, & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines can be found in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step will not be ignored. in this step, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage copy '\'\ 'and a line-slide show'\ '. usually, it can store files with different sizes in the page-on page, but then they could be different with different sizes in the page. if this option has to be disabled, this option is deactivated. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored, but the differences are displayed as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively looking for smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effectively for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic resume mode, this setting indicates how long the results of the selection is displayed before the next unoccupied conflict is going forward.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically solves all the conflicts in white mark by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection). if you need this only from time to time, then use the functions Wähle A / B / C for all unconscious white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter for scanning folders and execute a merge. look for details under documentation to directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and an older version exists, the original version is Suffix .original file, if already a backup file with the suffix .original file, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you must finish and restart3; this option is active in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is being globally tuned over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if enabled, this option is used to set the top setting for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selections for encoding appears a brief reference, which is the local coding. (this can't be changed here and has a pure informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted, as encoding for each file can be individually adjusted, even files with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define precursor commands, you may not work with your codec. (for example, your files could not work with your codec. (for example, your files could handle 16-bit Unicode.) With this option one can define the encoding of the issue of processing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this off to suppress the changes of changes in white characters in text or reviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options ignore or ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all the differences between two of three files will be displayed. however, you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. according to selecting from A & lt; gt; B, A & B; gt; C, A & B; gt; C, A & B; -gt; C, A & B; gt; C is displayed with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply browse the less important window. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the same window by side or each other. this can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to carry out the files. a simple click starts to merge the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge file, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will first be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3, the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor, which means exactly your requirements. for example, you can use this function for instance.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is handed over to this external command. (see above), the output of the command is only used during the line command. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds precisely to your requirements. every input line has to have an associated output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when set up the diff results, but most users don't want to program it. however, good news is that in most cases be used or perl entirely enough.</seg>
<seg id="2352">For example, use this command line command to convert the input string to the input string: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'. the\\ 's added text converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add bare string files. all following the same pattern to change $\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ _ BAR _ change\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\\ '\\'\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed experiment, you may start to understand and perhaps you may like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a complete processing command for line abruptures. enssed it / [0123456789.-] / / g 'is a suitable matches, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi-deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several objectives at one time. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the translations from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can use something different such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'Allerdings are different with perl some details. where used\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the preceded'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for viewing and to merge. the further operations only change the data that the line-abruptly-Algorythmus seem to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the Zeiltron preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you cannot notice certain differences or destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason you can compare and combine with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively compare and collapse.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... doing each object a proposal to merge together; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and displays the simulated changes without it really,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads to selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merge of individual files. you just need to specify the folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders can be merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder was specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start together, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you'll find a little news window about the current progress. if you cancel the file, only the files are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scan of the file is complete, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by using the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory contains two functions. all subdirectories can be opened with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click a file, the file will start immediately and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type of file is different in other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case the interaction can not be selected automatically. if the merge will be started again, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>

<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would be ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be selected specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystem a file is selected as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links on files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. when the option is enabled, the files will be compared to the links being disabled. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In links to folders: when the option is switched off, the links are evaluated as normal folder and recursively searches. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recursions), a link may lead to a junction and decrypt and decrypt.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Execute a complete analysis of each file by and displays statistics-columns. (the number of soldered, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if they do not contain text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, you may compare it faster, only the changeset and the file size will cost you a certain level of security. please be careful with caution. please use this option in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidment date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered to be identical if you have lost the amendment date. please use caution when copying the change date. please be careful with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronize mode when two folders are compared, and no target folders will be selected. in this mode, the results of the merge file are selected, and the results of the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is displayed in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differing differences will be proposed by copying the newer file as an action. (this is considered insecure, for it is provided that the other file is not changed too.) This option is checked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced by another version or deleted, the extension .orig. if an old backup file already exists with the .original file, this will not only be deleted without any other backup. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the file merge mode remains visible with the merge of individual files; you can turn off the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want, you can turn the menu window in the window menu and switch between directory & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file by using a double-click. however, you can also use a single file directly, without having to save the folder, the status will run properly when you run the file again and the file will not run once again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you read the directory again: directory menu: read new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open to local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively, or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spacing &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes, due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder. then, a link will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to process permissions or change of change. therefore, deviations or change of change from the original. (note the option confidential.) (This is only possible in local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main reason for use is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP directly start the built-in differences viewer. in order to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then choose In Kdiff3 part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as a KPart, it accepts & kdiff3; the names of the original file from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the program patch starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that it does not work if none of the original files exists. also, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & Kdiff3; as a part is executed, it supports only the comparisons of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge operation or the comparisons of folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">With the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is Commit) there is already. also, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can result together as the program diff3 from the diff-tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs for a very long time and have learned a lot that I saw in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or would go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You probably have compiled the program from the sources and you probably not find the right prefix to KDE. in the default setting, configure the resources on / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you can find further information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is identical, the line will be treated as not identical. if it is not identical, if it is not identical to any other, this is this is the Kis.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers any difference in the files where it begins and where he ends. this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it's too much effort to design an extra file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big so far. you can always recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is laded; No src lints; published and the text can't be deleted. what does it mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& Kdiff3; used already many colors to emphasize differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and lacks the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the game Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use & kdiff3 functions; you will need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms with no KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes using http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base file of & diff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, see further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have problems with compile. if difficulties are encountered, please report on the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umschalt removal) into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Note that files are identical in all folders not appear in the file structure, and thus not in target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version, you have to read the folder with the updates to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences will have shown that identical files will not be copied to the target file. if the target file does not contain these files, they are missing after the merge file. (the behavior will probably be modified in the default version.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are on one of the buttons, the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already available), they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. understanding differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; displays a thumbpreview of all virtual work areas. it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the working areas to finish it or postpone it. this works both within a desktop and with multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual work areas as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle button of the mouse, windows can be moved within & kpager; movement is possible both within a desktop or other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of & kpager; however, the context menu has added only the two entries, and the name of the application and the name of the application as well as the entries are mined, maximize, on desktop and finish. the commands confirm the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the use window on the full size of desktop. only appears when it was clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Use your application to select the selected Virtual Desktop. only appears when clicking on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved inside & kpager; s with the middle button on the desktop and also on other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, in & kpager, the names of virtual work surfaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Enabling this field to display the & kpager; view the numbers of virtual work spaces. it is displayed together with Name, are provided with ordinated numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>

<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, running programs will be displayed as small windows in & kpager; otherwise, only the empty spaces are displayed to allow the selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the window window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & kpager; top window can be determined: classic & kpager; in some other window managers, only shows all virtual work areas in a horizontal and vertical series, which is very good for the display at the side of desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini-program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can display and move the windows as icons or with their content and move it out outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and set up the switch from the switch... sends the dialog settings.</seg>

<seg id="2511">First, you should feel aware of which positions a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window, do not lead to unseasoned reactions. therefore, you can park the mouse to such places until you would like to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse, that's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you must take out the mouse ball. as this happens, from mouse to mouse different. but it should be clear, if you see the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are attached to the sides of the hole into which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can scrape off with a flat blade or your fingernagel.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists to carry out a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; restored and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, & kmousetool tries to run mouse clicks and put mouse clicks on a different spot.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Workaround: use the mouse to place the cursor location where you want to make it. so you can use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop. safe zones for the mouse button are & eg; grey surfaces around the tool bar and menus and the titlebar of windows.</seg>

<seg id="2522">Do not use smart shifts, if you just start with it & kmousetool; to use. select text instead below and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this way, where & kmousetool; the mouse button is playing a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when intelligent shifts start. later, you can also use intelligent shifts without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest Enlargement for & X Window; installed. that should be the case in most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are set up correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any language synthesizer, which can be launched at the command line in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be incomplete or obsolete. therefore, drag the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. look at the website of ktops;, according to information, which are not included in this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program "speech-tocher" uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthesizer. if you want to expand & ktts; for using another synthesizers, you can get in touch with the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filters is not mandatory but Debian users can install xsltproc using the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktops; you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or newer) including package kdelibs and the developer files for the program "speech-folks."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you get the source code from & ktts; get here from the source text for kdeaccessibility or download the program created every night of the program created with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you can use & ktts; first, check if speech-clover works properly with your language synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops; this is the first release of the program of the program. the kttmsg is designed to be developed directly and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual sets. the user can go punctually or satin, repeat the issue or cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If there is an application text to & ktts; for example, if you have set up the preferred speaker for the issue, for example, if you want a female English voice, this will automatically select the best matching speaker. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; a speaker chooses, see you in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the card button or click "Apply" to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card printer display is shown below. for example, the module for festival interactive is shown below. for details of the modules you can find below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable program. if the Path to Festival in PATH is included, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Choose the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival. in favour, this setting is made automatically. generally speaking, Western languages are using ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, adjust volume, speaker speed and sound height of the synthetic language. if you can't select a number of controls and this gray is displayed, the voice will not be displayed by you.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark the check box, these voices will already be synthesized on the start of KTTSD so that (for larger storage usage) the first set will be faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you don't have a spokesman (or don't forget to click). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If the check box is marked, at the start of kttsmgr the program window will be displayed. otherwise, only the kttsmgr in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to show the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is marked and kttsmgr does not run, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD is reading a text. this way, you have the possibility to survey or otherwise control the device.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all orders listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of phrases and the just machined movement. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With buttons in this row, you can go on in the order that is selected in the list below, or return in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With one click on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other cards) will be taken over to the system section. then click on this icon to show the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts is not installed but ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click on the card audio card instead. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Only text files are listed and managed. editions of Screen Reaing, Warnings and News are not displayed. more information about the news types of & ktts; find in.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If Gstreamer or aKode is to be used for the audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are shown in the list, select at least one module, select the PCM device here. see also</seg>
<seg id="2700">Adjust the audio speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds to about half and 200nbsp;% corresponds to the double normal speaker speed. thus these settings can be implemented, the program Sox needs to be installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Please click on to use the new settings for the running & ktops; -System.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all the PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. you'll need to figure out what device works with you. in case of doubt, select standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map card you can set up special actions which will always be run when the text contract is interrupted by a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of language orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">"" "the" "" "Screen Reaing" "" "output has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. after the edition of the Screen Reader has been read, the received orders are resumed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have priority the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after reading the warning again.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts the news. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just make a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; even someone welcomes the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text contract is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text is interrupted. if both conductive sound are active as well as introductory message, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card card only apply to normal text applications. for messages, warnings, and the issues of screen reaxes, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktops; Knotebook messages can be found, start kttsmgr and click on notifications. the flashing map appears.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Check this check box for reading the reading of & kde; -Notices to switch off. if this setting is not marked, the other settings are disabled and & ktts; read no alerts.</seg>

<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is stated in the list, will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this drop down menu to specify what & ktts; do when an event arrives. you have the following selection:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected custom text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholder:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the features of the required microphone station. standard select the speaker, which is displayed in the list on the map speakers as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if there is a certain event of a particular application, it is executed. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the particular application. as the last option the action is to carry out under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The Event All notifications for the application standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this purpose, you can set the above notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the button to save the settings for a file. use the button store to store the stored settings from a file. if you want to start with an empty list, click on delete. all entries except all notifications are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is an W3C standard to mark text for a voice-voice. this standard includes brands for controlling the voice and the pitch. also brands for control of pronunciation, for example Abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, a further W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations include:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the default voice, which is used in the SSML issue.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog not be set to 100nbsp;% is set, SSML text is commonly spoken very monoton.</seg>
<seg id="2726">"" "&lt;! [CDATA" "" "&lt;? XML version =" "" "UTF-8" "" "&gt; &lt;! DOCTYPE-PUBLIC" "" "&gt; &lt;! DOCTYPE, PUBLIC" "" "&gt; Who has slept in my bed? asked Mama Bär. who has slept in my bed?" "" "said the bear?]] &gt;" ""</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and propositional detection filter (SDB filter). this can only start with the prefix, since only the first set must be synthesized, not all the text order. so, you can also cancel the full text or withdraw or cancel, even if the speech synthesizer is not supported directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional detection filter. at the first start of & ktts; it will automatically add a propositional sign filter. you can change its settings or add further set-marginalized filtering, but beginners will not use.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to activate the microphone selection through dropouts. switch on the box menu, which actors & ktts; select some features and check out how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you need to set up some more than one speaker, otherwise the filters have to be effectual.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then, faster with the advance can start, since only the first set has to be processed and not all the text block, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then cancel texts on the card card or cancel, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-level detection filter will automatically be set up when you start kttgr for the first time. it can not be shut down only. don't change anything at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Compare with a regular expression of detection, compare text with a regular expression for propositional phrases and add a tabular sign (decimalcode 8) to the typing. note that the standard set-level detection filter controls the character string.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; messages, warnings, messages or the output of screen reprisals.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you remove the normal set-level detection filter, you can repaste it by load the file _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card selection menu, you can overwrite the speaker settings for use. the card card will be displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the upper on the card speaker). in other words, there are no intercom properties.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Using the appropriate microphone station, which has all the features of the speaker, does not delete or edit, choose & ktts; this speaker will be. otherwise select & ktts; the narrator, which corresponds to the original properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Choose the properties of the required microphone. if this feature doesn't matter, don't give any part.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check this check box if the property should have precedence over other properties. here you can also set several markings.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when the output is, this will always be used as a priority feature. the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language, if you know, a certain application text is sent in another language as the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the area of speakers that corresponds to the following indicated below, click on the select button, and then apply to narrator, which corresponds to the below.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (no order number is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it gets started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and ktops; however, you have to register GStreamer. at GStreamer 0.8.x, the command GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, it may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I stop music at the same time with another application. if I have a text order, friert & ktts; a message appears on the & console; a message appears to open.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is the problem that conflicts are present at ALSA, which can prevent a simultaneously opening multiple PCM devices. tips for potential solutions you can find on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-projection ect.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for the festival on the internet. I installed it and can't use it in festival but kttsmgr will not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">If you add in the file $KDEHOME / share / kttsd / Voices, add the new voice. as a guide you can use the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL, where you can find the voice to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card box Audio there is a setting speed. with this it works, the program Sox must be installed and on the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers module like Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed. depending on the selected voice, this function is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the talk speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; pre-read. (this is where the HTML is controlled in the SSML code.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; after & XML; (see) or if you are completely brave, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -according to SSML format filter, and set up the audio speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it pretend to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speakers, but & ktts; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the tag Sable GENDER does not work to function. this festival doesn't produce any mistakes, rejects the XSL file to convert from SSML to Saber the GENDER tags. the same applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string bag filter and now I can't go back in & ktops; not more satin, the order is displayed only from a set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, lauresign, comma and semi-label) you can not filter out. use a filter for propositional recognition instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; (www.alsa-projection ect.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the modules for GStreamer are registered by using GStreamer on board and the command GST-register. (HTTP: / / gainamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system also counts, you can't play music at the same time and start a text. Freezes if you want a text order and then proceed further. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">At stand July 2005, aKode supported no real breaks. if you keep a text order in & ktts, the current sentence will still be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program Sox is used for the general attitude of the talk speed but otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install Sox using the command apt-get install Sox. the program is included on most & Linux; CDs are already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded & ktts; as tarball (with tar covered archive), sign up as normal user and unzip the tarball in a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizer, whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally well, and there are several voices and languages supported. for many voices, you can adjust volume, talk speed and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help with this you will find in the instructions that will be delivered with festival. if you want to read websites, you must install the (male British) voice of Rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices, you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code from the festival. German voices are subject to limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice puts the festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early development stage. unpack the software in festival / lib / Voices / Russian /. if you enter the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices msu _ ru _ nsh _ diphone. choose a cyrillic (8 bit-) encoding as for example KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux; distributions do not look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>

<seg id="2809">The displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button, set up the device in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Extended Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The TCP / IP settings for the system can be operated using a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP information will be required for any system start and therefore no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The Manually can be carried out without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP configuration must be specified. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initiates network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values given in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address will not be used within the network. entering a TCP / IP conflict, you can determine if the desired address is already used in use. in the case, the network administrator should be requested.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network appliances can be activated or switched on according to your needs. activating a network device, activating from the list and clicking the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network appliances can be activated or switched off according to your needs. in turn, an activated network device is carried out by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Establishes the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which conveys physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name due to the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computer only calls for IP addresses. if the computer uses http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS resolves this name into an IP address such as 123,45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the name resolution part of the player name resolution allows easy administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified. DNS entries can be set up in the list with buttons, up or downunder in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... you can add a DNS server to the user computer. it will be added to the dialogue New Nameserver.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group computer to the name resolution you select one entry and then click Edit button.... It will be displayed to dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list named IP-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily on booting, if no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually, the list contains some entries, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this will still be replaced by IP in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click "Add" The dialog New also to add.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known host and click the Add button. if the well-known computer has several alias names, add button adding several times and enter the further alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Choose an entry of a well-known computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog of the Computer dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">If one of the following tasks are executed, then the list of the static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in Module Network settings are not effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command has to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The website of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distribution (usually rpm packages) it is enough when & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and inside a single panel; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should accomplish this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be discussed in the second, all of & knetworkconf; change configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace more information about IP networks. this appendix contains only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Today, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been discontinued to spread it. this description is therefore currently focused on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator can be assigned to a valid IP address. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When placing a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected to avoid IP address to the global (internet) network. the addresses from table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be done by adjusting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask will usually be set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are included in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard Route (localhost = the own calculator). the default route is required for the IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 can be reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is an own so-called loopback interface, which operates as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files which are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified by DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections to find another content than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& Ndat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first target was to answer a surface for tar, which provided the ability to answer a question that my wife took: how much longer does it take?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& Ndat; trains the tape and read the prestressing information of the tape. detects & kdat; you don't know if the tape is formatted if the tape is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; looking for the matching index on your disk. can this not be found, you'll be asked if the index index is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything has gone smooth, the symbol for the tape drive, to indicate that the tape appears. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, first the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& Ndat; gives you a change in the symbol for the band to realize the integration of the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be kicked out without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; it can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">One band cards need to formatted before you can use to store data. this process does not have to formatted the formatting at & kdat; this procedure does not have to be formatted before you have to formatted the tape. floppy tape drives are usually not formatted for DAT drives.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the date the volume will automatically be integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup, you need to select the secured files, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be saved by this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Check files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the Shechem menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog for backup will open. in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings, the dialog for backup appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive. it will only be checked out the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Check the files in one of the archives in entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure started, the dialog for Checking Settings. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the dialog for Checking the dialog, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the testing process and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can access the restore, the files you need to be recovered. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Choose a file or folder in one of the archives which include the entry for the tape drive. it will only be restored to the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>

<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been launched, the dialog for Restoration. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the dialog for Restoration, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of reformation as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to re-create the band indexfile using the band contents. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can rebuild the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a safety profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a secure profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder, where the backup should be done. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the newly elected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, are the file being stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are stored on other file systems, you can separately put them under backup files. every entry is considered as tar regardless of the other file system.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have been changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used since the last incremental backup file. only the files have been backed since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to set changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons are supported; and lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using menu item KDat... in menu settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path has to refer to the non-rewinding variant of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is mounted, the command converts back to the drive. some drives are necessary before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, & kdat tries to lock the cast at the tape drive. maybe this setting does not work on all banddrives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched ON, the soldering of & kdat; automatically shut down the tape. do not use this option at Floppy-Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, you tried & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. no-all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you have to tell & kdat; in any case, you have to inform the block size for your bandrun.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only display a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The volume ID. the format of this string is name: seconds, the machine name is formatted on which the tape has been formatted on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is passed since the epoch has been formatted in which the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archive that can manage directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup job. this symbol is only active if a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for unused users who can't know where to get information about your system or where the system provides information on the various protocol files. in addition, & ksystematic log; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystematic log; helps users to understand what your computer is doing in the background. the program is used for unexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore, & ksystematic log; experienced users to provide quick access to information about problems which appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, some advanced features may be filtered and analysed directly with their help.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystematic log; a number of useful functions. among others include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for format of the Syslog server and samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions also include and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screens, & ksystematic log; functions are available, with their help you can filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file and are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tempted & ksystemlog; first of all, you don't want to open it, and it will open itself instead of a small message box, and it will probably not open with system administrators. the protocol files usually have no justification for reading the normal user.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or following strings. in the default setting, the list of the log file will be displayed automatically, so that only log file will be displayed in addition to the filter line. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry at this point. in addition, select the filename of the filter search then only with entries in the selected column, and carry out in the filter bar the name of a process, so shows & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default settings and helps you identify the key protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a striking colour as protocol stack. the colored display of protocol-lines can be shut down setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you are looking for only a specific process (for example in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), this allows you to examine the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command, such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to activate new lines in context menu of the main window to show all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a submenu, select a protocol to display them.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystematic log; has a dedicated website to http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.or.Dort you find further information about the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystematic log; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystematic log; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather well known (and listed below) as & ksysv; this section shows a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init is rapidly developing the standard for controlling the program start-up of the system in der & Linux; this is because it's easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD inputs.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (for example, because I do not know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to make a machine on System V Init without having a reinstallation and new formatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from BSD inputs, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you would like to run on a different runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which will only be started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should now lie down under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do not own this file, even if you don't want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is listed in / etc / inittany. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change the default, then you can change / etc / inittoff by hand and then you can repair it when you restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it all start the right scripts? if you enter -l enter rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no right files are located. instead, each entry is link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it's a argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripting by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd servers. init reads the name, and when it includes a K, the script will be called stop-stop. if it includes a S, the script will start using the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server Runlevel, that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. I also could have a user-level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other pointer is easy to not trivial, simply drag an entry in the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start at this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveling or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen when you remove an entry from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only happen when you draw a record from the scope of availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved to copy these into a new area. to add them to a new runlevel, you have to select copying from the menu Edit or from the Context menu, and even if this entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a entry can sometimes be calculated sometimes. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the ambient entries, before you can try again to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash bin. so use caution.</seg>

<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution system: please check if all the configuration files are available (and also whether they are in the right-list). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply complete without any message, if their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
