although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinary .
like many of my generation I raised up with American movies , American authors have read and practic@@ ed American writers .
in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gray Gran@@ tham in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spi@@ racy of a oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Roberts , who wanted to inc@@ lined his interest .
I was tra@@ pped .
free after Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if it is absolute truth , forget everything else , that is what I would like to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always who you are , and it is easily gaining acceptance in a community of con@@ vi@@ able people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had written a very warm love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me how he turns with his narrow @-@ minded personality .
he never stops in his mind behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he tells us what he feels like a former colleague and publicly declar@@ es his contemp@@ t for Muslims , lat@@ in , Af@@ ro@@ american and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his testimony and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won by the rep@@ ubli@@ can election , was the highest number one ever rated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that support this big@@ lot person , I asked myself ?
I could not have Tr@@ ump and his voters do not get in harmony with people that I had to know during my time in Phoenix .
for example , according to my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alization program , the people from all over the world , a deep belie@@ ving man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps did not agree with the editor of &quot; Cincinn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; with the current publisher of the Cincinn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball , and we spent a lot of hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I lived with Sandy b@@ ahr , who fights their lives for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
it still suits her commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped to get used to the complexity of American life with patience and grace .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , were my ment@@ ors who helped me so much in my career .
these people and those em@@ bo@@ died by them in@@ hib@@ ited my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump his way to nomin@@ ate Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential data , they sent me a stop and the counter@@ part at its restricted vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps due to his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump because they divided either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were prepared to over@@ look such things , almost the heart broke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the ump @-@ voters as a law@@ si@@ est .
in order to arrange people , one of my friends , is exactly what led to us this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who deal with a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes are not taken into account in their communities .
could it be that those voters , of whom are most white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to reg@@ ain control over a country they have disappointed ?
in other words , perhaps they would perhaps say that in this America they are still important ?
maybe . maybe .
however , hardly anyone can forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who is a cruel decision , who comes down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( note about the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; word game of white to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which is as much as Sch@@ leu@@ k@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it has been the great Van Jones , has exactly what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you might have always like , America is always welcome .
for this country chose the son of an Ken@@ yan , whose story as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is huge part of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of that promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , had my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd shou@@ ted .
&quot; do Lat@@ ino have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if anyone who isn &apos;t like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ uman &apos;s country , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new America .
and it is my heart .

out of the mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t spoil their love for music by garbage .
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments &quot; by Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Flickr user O@@ EA @-@ O@@ AS ( CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what about the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very narrow connection with ...
music , who lives with the tr@@ ash
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from nearby beautiful cre@@ ek ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for several years the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a sym@@ ph@@ ony of children and adults , which has an opportunity for over@@ coming poverty , with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students is become the central interest for the parish of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English Newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth always offered a rare hop@@ el@@ ance .
the young band members take their comm@@ it@@ ments to the music group seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI comments :
as soon as they come out of school , they run away back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their big passion .
they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le you day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ bre@@ l , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , which is located practically on the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of Paraguay , on instruments made of recycled polyethylene :
music with recovered instruments made up of local firm waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recy@@ c@@ ler began under the bat@@ on of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez with that parts of waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trumpet , trombone , trombone , trumpet and trombone .
the re@@ pertoire en@@ comp@@ asses classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and by the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , reminds the beginning of :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them are not living with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made of tr@@ ash .
today there is an orchestra which plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the musical performance on : &quot; &quot; &quot;
each year , the world generates around one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the wor@@ m@@ ons - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of garbage to music around the world .
the orchestra also played its music from Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can fight against illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ published part occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of Content .
in West Africa then it was known that the ship had already practic@@ ed illegal fishing in liber@@ ic waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the East African countries were raised by this and little inc@@ lined to welcome the crimin@@ als of this kind to their co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused to sell one of its har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the one time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch the fish .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects crimin@@ als and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries that illeg@@ ally stop fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries , who had exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that work and work together . they exchange information and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project provides support for F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is under definition ir@@ regul@@ ate : what is caught is hidden , so because of it is extremely difficult to locate . so the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by deliber@@ ately mis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and species are protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem harm can have a delicate equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
however , while actions against illegal fishing became ob@@ struc@@ ted by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ dle , and with the information from different countries , these actions happen in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange and discuss lists of existing licenses for example , news on susp@@ icious activity or details that one had noticed during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also pursu@@ es very attentive to the activities of ships , when they move on the open seas , with satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark those who fishing ships in forbidden areas - such as susp@@ icious routes - such that a ship charges his caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such studies may show whether the infected ships have a fishing licence , where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal can@@ ist@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can accept the acceptance of such ships in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships can not sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the prime minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owners , which means that illegal fishing catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally free anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advis@@ er company supported by the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , who lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen , who inv@@ ading eastern African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , which attracts commercial fishing companies from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
among other practices such actions , like sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , speci@@ fying iden@@ tik@@ as@@ ification , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of an un@@ complete control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal fishing and a country could then say &apos; You must not run away my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the closed front works so far .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 studies of extensive ships .
it has un@@ covered criminal networks , which had counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . there were ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found their wing@@ ed ships .
due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that helps F@@ ISH @-@ i to more susp@@ icious ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed further , helps to hide from illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Che@@ f@@ analy@@ st with Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fishing data and provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ort@@ alized by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that links different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal acts with greater precision .
one model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations can actually take influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened its presence with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and display the capacity of each individual trace@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neigh@@ bors , to get a better picture of it , who is doing what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project running in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crimin@@ als , but also det@@ ecting them .
ships which were previously committed without license and had to reck@@ on with consequences , now they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since then fishing boats may buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 found out , inspec@@ tors found there on board towing networks , whose deployment is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice this success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we have now also copying other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa annually , several hundred million dollars will disappear through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries together in 2015 , on the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is to be even more such initiatives in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s recent member of Somalia were able to report his first big triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship travelling under false flag . not only the ship was on board without a license and tow@@ ed tow@@ ed nets that are now forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also reserved in forbidden waters which were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the take of rules against Gre@@ ko 1 they set out a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time , proof that such special , collabor@@ ative working methods to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .

they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for the term Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after Venezuela &apos;s request for the opposition of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venet@@ ians responded , in whose eyes the negotiations re@@ acted on the political and economic crisis of the country to lead them to the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the withdrawal of Venezuela ) can be found in both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments against and against them .
the debate will also be guided in other parts of the country , among others in the Fla@@ ine area Bar@@ inas , in the areas of areas Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally located Bun@@ dest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , what is perceived in everyday life of dental vene@@ ers through a acute short@@ age of food and drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the Opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the office of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the maintenance of a re@@ election was blocked by official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Contri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government statements in a recent article :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate of inflation was estimated at 500 % for the end of the world ( the inflation rate for many as the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ itate its institu@@ tional structures and to close a new government alliance .

the call was commented on Twitter , including this :

on Twitter , pictures collected from disputes , as well as reports of re@@ pression and abuse .
large waves beat the news on police supp@@ ression across the town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , to protect themselves according to their own statement before police and armed decisions of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators attemp@@ ted to stop police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ staat state , T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira have no skirts because otherwise you could not see what many national gar@@ sts did not have !
in the meantime there is an inf@@ ographic on lap , which forms the degree of op@@ pression a day :
thus the dictatorship had supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had provided the validity of the claim after a term procedure - this has now been proved in the eyes of many of the presence of countless people on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your term th@@ igh !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other values do this protest as a further step in the fight against a government requ@@ iring a little bit against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and rather has gras@@ ped critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the markets always take more on frequency and intensity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Venet@@ ians reported the media , they were too hungry for taking part in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated in English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced from his father to watch the at@@ ro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean city Córdoba .
as an adult , Qu@@ ij@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera cre@@ ek in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of bearing the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough .
for 34 years , he retained the family secrets for himself .
in the situation then I believed that was in order .
I felt like a sal@@ mag@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years , you can &apos;t notice that it is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not yet know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ks , and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ian military dictatorship of 1974 till 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander in the prison group 141 until 1978 .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors who was accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ an@@ os son , a man who had witnessed the extent of the at@@ ro@@ cities that he had witnessed as a boy , and he spoke before a German court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has his child and how this child chose a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was a crowd of mar@@ tial arts .
they all called him &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father of him , and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo , calling me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you have rounded off with one of the ERP .
pass only that they will not lead you one day and then I must save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the Revolu@@ tionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolu@@ tionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret .
I was 15 years old and I thought I was fine . for so my father had moved me up .
at the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers which had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university circuits , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simple everything .

&apos;@@ da gl@@ ands the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to exp@@ ire . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the car , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood .
all of it was st@@ ole .
he gave me a small blanket of wrapped pop@@ es , and told me it to be a car . when I opened it , I saw it was a big cl@@ ump in silver .
this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects have been shut down and supp@@ ressed me with an out@@ post .
suddenly he spoke to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw in , and saw a song that was tor@@ tured on men .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later , I found out that they for@@ tified the end of a cable . the other end was fixed to the body of the person who was cap@@ tiv@@ ated there .
she rarely finds a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ threw him with water and sent him a charge of 220 Volt into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was aw@@ k@@ ward ... like a dirty wine .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell of his room came .
I realized the smell immediately and I knew it was clear that the smell of a body in need is .
I never could forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that one person can do so much grief ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra to the area where the prisoners had cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and they were tied to the eye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who were also accused in the process ) and I took the opportunity to cast a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were bound up with the face - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people are silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were buried by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told at home .
next to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were called offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero had a man and killed there .
( according to survi@@ vor@@ s , the civil Society Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial at La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , was also indicted for students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way you came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they got a number assigned to the process of emp@@ athy .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order from above came that they should be laid .
this was a lie - the eu@@ ph@@ an@@ ism - for the shot of the human being and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; Dest@@ ru@@ ction &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
back then in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ fare &quot; - how they called it - was .
but when I was in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs , which one assumes an enemy who is fought against .

but when you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not war@@ fare , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , carried with this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never really like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crime , and I answered : and you , who shot cars on the road ?
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me , and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and slay you .
we don &apos;t need any others !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
as I said in the process , I showed a photo of that at which I wore a coat and a roll pul@@ lover made of wool . I had both my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then at that time accused me accused me to have been a pity on this crime . I rep@@ lied , no problem , they can put me to load what they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was there anyway , to speak .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ ination act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel repent@@ ance .
I have children . if you have children , one can recognize the value of a life .
one develops and realize that it &apos;s wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you are ex@@ u@@ pped during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children kid@@ nap ?
one day , my father brought a girl who had been killed by his mother .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always gave me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have just put them into prison .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but why does their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not have families to surrender their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ ination act that can be done to man .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced back , they brought machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were gr@@ inded and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything remains forever .
&quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimes - among them my father .
the idea , to view my father , was put under house arrest during a meeting .
I made him bl@@ amed because of all the at@@ ro@@ cities which I had to experience in his ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I haven &apos;t killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt internally ri@@ dic@@ ated and asked me what the whole patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended , actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you say s@@ ow@@ as to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you committed terri@@ fic crimes and you forced me as a child to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he rep@@ lied only &quot; Well , then I &apos;ll show me . &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first display .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can pret@@ end that I &apos;m bi@@ ased . I finally told my own father .

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the particle to the order of judgment .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera proce@@ eded against the crimes committed in August 1975 and December 1978 , committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 Th@@ op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity : the Court found life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases , and in nine cases there was free trial .
eleven of the original 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and ra@@ pe by ministers . # Es@@ War@@ head ror@@ ism
all the accused were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Piero De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la in June 1976 .
he taught the following words to the chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court Committee is a historical landmark for all human rights organizations which have worked for the sacrifice for years on justice .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentin@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who had been murdered in the dictatorship of men who were murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial took more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government transferred the country to the state of La Per@@ la that could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organizations .

an translation defect makes older people in Kyoto too &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation defect at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened Center in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a very particularly mis@@ erable translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( co@@ her@@ on sha ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but perhaps also with the rac@@ er rear @-@ like &amp; # 8@@ 212 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was on electronic displays from 1 to 20 September in the lobby and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the mistake was made to the translator Julian Holmes , a local man Ky@@ oto . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holmes &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the defective English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; haw@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropri@@ ately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture was sorry for the translation mistake . furthermore she explained that the error was already in the text , and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told how follows the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people felt thanks to the in@@ adequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News continued to deal with the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents , but are definitely cause to worry .
in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005 , representing a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this means that their share increased by 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents dropped in total , the proportion of victims caused by sen@@ iors in the same period increased .
the named Rep@@ orter brought comments in the article published by the article comments on the Light which show the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via the translation errors won the following comments :
&quot; is this ( &quot; terrible car &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the translation not f@@ law@@ ed , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation mistake . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and in the whole of Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure for this bizarre mistake in English .
photo of Flickr user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
to over@@ end , you need two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transmit it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in case of native language . in general , belief that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language language - mother tongue .
a French native tongue should translate into French for example from English to French - not from French to English .
photo of Flickr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as mother tongue that could make translations into English . this may be attributed to lack of understanding , quot@@ ations , or the relatively low number of native speakers that can be Japanese .
some companies , who have no foreign employees themselves , make translations to make their company intern . then , the Japanese employees , whose English knowledge , will be the best to trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Flickr user Karl Baron .
machine translations are widespread - often with funny results .
the words and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases that arise through machine translations , that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the wei@@ rd English form@@ ations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints , which often uses T @-@ shirts or pockets , are used only for sty@@ list@@ ic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Flickr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be even acceptable or at least harmless . but of large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the City of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source of translations for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and C@@ ens@@ ur@@ ns to take on internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ is@@ con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
Friday morning , 7 April , reported Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users that they had no access to the online station Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the performances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were also not accessible anymore .
other online stations also contributed footage of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups to with@@ stand the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro government .
protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament , and the European Parliament &apos;s tasks were entru@@ sted to the executive and the Supreme Court himself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was coupled to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ ite providers are blocked again .
this is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
camping offers as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among dental vene@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened with t@@ elecommunic@@ ations and fin@@ ances if they continue to report on demonstrations by the Commission as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I logged in @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two liters of so@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ c@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is not only accessible through a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ itters . this also applies to its meetings , on which the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
former research projects of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had yiel@@ ded that the local Internet provider can sometimes use DNS . it is a technique posted by the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds to an error or ref@@ uses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ der@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V camera man Elvis Flores , who carried out the protests in Caracas , was taken .
Flores was beaten , while he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible through YouTube , it also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connection : thus , the Venet@@ ians will continue to make access to multimedia reports on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls are dealing with slave to obtain an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts witness to other cri@@ m@@ itas , which were exactly like them victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use of friendly permission .
the following article is the shortened version of a report which is published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en , &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , dis@@ ru@@ ding schools &quot; ) , processed and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where she was not working with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house came with pride on them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something like something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas one design@@ ates the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a big family with little money out@@ gives her minor son or her younger daughter to another , rich@@ ness family . in exchange , the child is eating , an apprentic@@ eship and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what is not mentioned , however , that children must do countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the framework of a contract you cannot lift up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is widespread in Paraguay , due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ oni@@ als , resear@@ ched and reli@@ eved .
she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is imp@@ aired by Cri@@ ad@@ itas , will always guarantee a halt .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the family , who gives her daughter in the belief that they can improve their training , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out of itself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a different family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family that decre@@ ases the girl with their faith and just@@ ify their exploitation by faith , that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will know about many years later .
sometimes they even experience it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ de@@ dly in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was born in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in the hospital , her body showed traces of great blo@@ ws . soon she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ min@@ ita in the household of the former military men Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a public officer .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed to Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of a young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they under@@ took that the murdered child was a Cri@@ min@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply ro@@ oted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice for the death of the girl .
they painted the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstr@@ ating that there would be no other Carolina &apos; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which terms , boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society groups demanded an excellent investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark , if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
everyday life of a Cri@@ min@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as labour , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to leave bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost his father &apos;s work .
their brothers now had to work and started working on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ min@@ ita .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to split the time so that you still stayed time for learning .
they rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for their employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleans@@ ed the refrigerator , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and the infected ground .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she was never star@@ ving , but was also not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , an former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which had been in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the owner of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand alongside him and to read Editorial from opposition newspapers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media over the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held it for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who was listening to over politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t often allowed me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; in this way , that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , to their home their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í would speak .
their Lord feared that she would have the education that she had allowed to lose , explains them .
but it was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she had paid by them with hard work .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated in school . &quot; a thing about which almost never been spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans , to which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school if they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ min@@ ita .
I was unable to invite anyone home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time , where friend@@ ships emer@@ ge , I felt very clearly that I was among the group .
isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
Society dis@@ appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group where you can only share vac@@ an@@ cies for cleaning and children &apos;s cities in Paraguay .

&quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians have recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ars regarding usage and util@@ isation of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to use citizens who are instru@@ cted to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users would have to register in order to register social networks on the site , with its right names and personal information numbers .
if it fails to do this , this could be a penalty of up to six months &apos; imprisonment or a fine of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill who consists of six paragraph , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video @-@ program and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced , as the draft has no indication of how the Egyptian authorities are planning to register the users who are not able to sign up to the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul S@@ ord@@ ar , parliamentary elections and supporters of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to it it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not so far known that such schem@@ es exist .
expert and experts on @-@ site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of proposal .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Technical Expertise ( in German &quot; conduc@@ tive research associate &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take it seriously , then it means that they apply a powerful monitoring system to interpre@@ t citizens , which means a permit or not . and this means a mad system to monitor the activity of people and bring them to a court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed under the legisl@@ ative of Parliament and the constitu@@ encies before it deb@@ ated into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and en@@ forcement are successful or not , the design &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the surface is present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says R@@ ao@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the par@@ liament@@ arian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y struck a bill of cy@@ ber @-@ crime against those who have been found guilty to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq , animal protective H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the mental Persian op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the bigger family of the Leop@@ ards , which are di@@ pped through Africa and Asia , are among the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they are always less lo@@ ot .
why is this particular kind of Leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory of the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big rob@@ ber@@ y exists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in fact is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that it is a recording of a big cat in the camera &apos;s camera , R@@ aza falls in pure joy .
as trained Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza like a different side of their country , which exists not only from war and conflict .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in early March 2017 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , who achieved progress in the last six years , had been achieved to re@@ build the lives of those who had been hit by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an at@@ om accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened the disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ in@@ o @-@ Zeitung , located in S@@ end@@ ai , is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was in Japan &apos;s north @-@ east , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished entire coastal cities from the map .
on the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened , for that reason , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report by K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows that progress has been reached from local perspective for six years , to re@@ build the life of the local districts .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the data subject .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o paper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned substitute houses ( k@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ata were finished .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures were recorded by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned surro@@ unds were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima won the closing light with 70 per cent .
even six years after the disaster , it is still trying to deal with accommodation ( k@@ ig@@ matic ) , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , even six years after the catastrophe .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Shel@@ ter .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ata in such Beh@@ aus@@ ungen .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened in 2011 , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had become more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated families who were evacu@@ ated after the disaster , were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ata the figure is 34 percent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vacc@@ o paper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , opened their doors down to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fishing har@@ bors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , just 30 percent of fishing har@@ bors have res@@ umed its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and atomic accident , with@@ drew large areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agriculture .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural field in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of agricultural field in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear bomb , only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farm@@ lands of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lying in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the tourism has largely re@@ covering itself , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains down@@ cast away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same state as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , only 75 percent can be seen here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o paper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to identify a whole picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacu@@ ated population . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how you find feeling against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of this article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o paper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents think that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astroph@@ es was done .
as it stands for those who evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture .
in her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reinforced its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima situation .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the devast@@ ating earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also the witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ic accident , atomic accident , Japan had ever had to experience .
out of 160 000 thousand evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , settled in permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of its home @-@ pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astroph@@ es , most of the evacu@@ ated events , who still have to return in Beh@@ el@@ ong@@ ings , are more than 50 years old . they must compete in proper accommodation projects , because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a project that will be part of the Olympic Games , which will be part of the Tokyo 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people encounter other language coming from other countries , the differences seem to be bigger than the common@@ alities .
however , after a while , one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these global links are important , as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to extend our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we watch exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get fewer attention when they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country boundaries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as said about the time that she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was shipped this week in the intensive care unit : last Friday had struck him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a strike against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , studied a brain @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures suffered .
doctors performed him this Saturday and put it into an artificial com@@ a .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spreads rapidly within a few days .
the face of the police officer could also recognize the face of police officers , identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident the military police found in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the investigation of the incident was suspended from active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with its impact on the face of student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer spra@@ yed on a prot@@ esters and end on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months , and all the re@@ pression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DES@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz recorded video on the net , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked from the police officer and several sanitary shortly thereafter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video showing the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the below shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now have 10,000 Brasili@@ an Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás .
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political power : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was murdered by his father , because he was accused of a very sad case of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App Group , who was accused of a police station after he was attacked by a police , who attacked him with a bu@@ zz@@ ard .
police raid on the police
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to prot@@ esters against prot@@ esters in the past Friday .
polic@@ emen set up a stage for speakers at the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators have built a stage for speakers , rub@@ bers and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the deputy Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian Media roads have sli@@ pped off by focusing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were targeted specifically through a bro@@ min@@ ated glass window to illustr@@ ate the title pages illustr@@ ative with a photo .
but the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a dis@@ continuous window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
you have to recognize this , if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of military police are dealt with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on the confron@@ tation with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rel@@ ev@@ alisation of the villages of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso closed almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as a el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , no matter of that there is no notable su@@ gar@@ dener on @-@ site .
it &apos;s two years ago when the activities were l@@ ame in the sugar cane mill factories .
after the rise , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its plants , until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the job .
others re@@ signed and comm@@ uting daily to the factories , which are even grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands at 4 : 00 every day , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not bol@@ ted his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the sugar cane factories , which after long in@@ active time are in operation because they were received .
that was something he was not expected .
N@@ ene re@@ members that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would have received the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ effici@@ encies and climate change .
by 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
the message would have been a motive for the land a few decades ago , but the bad yields were not any more new .
why was the Cuban sugar cane fe@@ ats off ?
the old railway track of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the di@@ min@@ ution of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mill factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive for the country .
initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar @-@ plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of an un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os will stay in pounds , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural Per@@ spectives , &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go down with security in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
during the years the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar cane @-@ factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word that he is most repe@@ ating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to receive the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of the first year , the first letters started .
it was officially included documents which would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed from the addressing and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ la Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve every sympathy .
from then on , the responsibility was transferred and the letters were becoming more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o had been responsible for the dis@@ used factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still @-@ grown su@@ gar@@ be@@ et factories . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in his will at the halt of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with each part , which he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producer has been obl@@ iter@@ ated .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the working and services provided by the communities in the con@@ greg@@ ations in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech given by the 21st of October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw that he had no longer run for the areas , whose factories had not been in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted by Mah@@ len only high .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the Commun@@ e of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things are changing , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane mill closed , or better said when they started to drive them off , they also listened to asphalt road , dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the area , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
nine months old soldiers bring a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .

they tor@@ ment it for ten years .
N@@ ene is at age 65 in R@@ ente , not because it is lacking in power but because he is bitter@@ ness .

you@@ ths from the First Nations communities across Canada do deal with topics that are important for them . they do them with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour we have been bringing up workshop mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio , video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and together with ten C@@ ree communities and then with the C@@ ree Hip Hop Group The North@@ stars worked together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is thus increasing the young participants in discussions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or what always gets to the sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ h@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to medi@@ ate how important of the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people have not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation have recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung on C@@ ree .
the yo@@ ungst@@ ers responded to a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars hip @-@ hop group that gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
at the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is at your disposal , as well as a translation into English , which transl@@ ates into German here :
sometimes I feel like that one would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on the earth
this is the day where you will take our cry .
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will be lev@@ elled one day .
I would not like to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also lead our youth up
so you can do it , wher@@ eto she has determined the creator
in the commentary volume the readers and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also publishes a contribution and add the verse in sil@@ ver@@ title ( which is also published on his blog and is published with approval ) :
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to illustr@@ ate potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are located close to the menu sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( k@@ ig@@ matic ) , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of each food , served in this restaurant .
customers will see this plastic dishes , and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there are a large number of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes made by the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a about 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they are no more notably . however , a new trend is transformed into show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome the Blo@@ g@@ it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sandy pur@@ u .
now on special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons decorated with plastic rib@@ bons like it can be shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , cool@@ box mag@@ nets :
here are some sho@@ ots for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is increasingly more elabor@@ ate .
in this case , an imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl of seafood ) was transformed into a cell support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile stand .
we also have this part in the Tokyo Station .
and here &apos;s an apple , which det@@ ects your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
a few cell support and cell phone designer allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon have been che@@ ated , a popular T@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their dou@@ bts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can che@@ ated my mobile phone with salmon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appet@@ izing form , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant to surprise .
our latest mobile support has the form of mel@@ odi@@ ous ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ rails of dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # Solid State .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sandy pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug traff@@ icker . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the susp@@ ects and killed are only reflected in statistics . these reflect at all not the extent of the human tragedy that this battle brings together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ al@@ oa cart@@ el , over@@ threw the stories of the conflict in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on day after a violent incident we hardly see someone who have learned to live with pain , or to the churches that have learned to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind each skel@@ eton , behind every skel@@ et@@ ition in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose w@@ ounds , may never cure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with drug traff@@ icking ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with drug traff@@ icking ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with drug traff@@ icking ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give this sacrifice a voice and stories about people who are in the struggle between pen@@ en@@ ary authorities and cart@@ ograph@@ s ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as :
organised crime does not only fear us to fear our lives .
the effects are much profound .
for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug producers and so whole communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as many as milk .
the Pain of Sac@@ rif@@ ice
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ vi@@ que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells about these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for secret graves after his son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have put to get rid of and after graves , after the people who we loved are looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but she will not pay off , because those who require a dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; will explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those that are afraid . we must show international community conflicts , the frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
KY@@ O , a reader of animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ a , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , whether in what form it occurs : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been acquain@@ ted with disease and sens@@ ory journ@@ alism for some years now .
I pass every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with images that actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is dis@@ gu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to the body once .
I cannot be in@@ different or considered as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : drug retailers ) he wants to be great . and it &apos;s also not normal to hear people songs about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of perpet@@ rators when they walk through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , that , as if they have lost those who have lost somebody , and those who have fear , they will have something like that .
I see our weakness when stories are to blo@@ t numbers in a statist@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crime of men is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbor@@ ing resort are justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four Mon@@ ths black@@ ened in the capital area : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a family with thre@@ ats ra@@ ided , it describes how armed crime month was pressed for month money from her business until they did not only destroy the business but also their family apart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain is never upset , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are away from each other , the better .
she included her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kid@@ nap or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if I would like to dissolve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ gotten children from Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime ?
what is it like to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other cub@@ s of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to s@@ own a egg , potatoes , tort@@ illas warm and &quot; ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he rel@@ ates about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been over two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody bodies of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw that :
Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against it with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders for public security and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors were 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ per per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are just a few hundred thousand , who leaves the organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade them into the soul of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
few stories continue to live in the face of the head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ro@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; in 2015 , Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades , in a different way of understanding .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages that it linked to which he links images on which violence is depicted .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment in which it comes to withdraw a rum@@ or or to escape a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something the first time is di@@ pped ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tend to continue to exist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication it was used to handle the trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny the fact that there are plentiful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he raises questions about our request for pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank car crossed the village of San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ l around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war in Africa the second largest country had been negle@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region had become dangerous trails full of stro@@ kes that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank car fell victim to the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; administration officials describes a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses covered , including a cinem@@ as near , which was full of people who was full of the soccer world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
houses sealed and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignor@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the stock form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes that day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example .
it shows ranks shortened body which le@@ ys up on the ground , while persons can look at them .
but here the story does not find her end .
over the years , the same photo was recre@@ ated several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but real though not related to the related trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the party of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eyel@@ ids reported dra@@ stically by at@@ ro@@ cities where they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down , and sh@@ ear@@ ths were in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were lab@@ elled , shot or burned .
only by satellite images , the following time could be depicted .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attemp@@ ting of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this picture shows the image of the DR Congo as proof for the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented : &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ descriptions ; Africa Check has documented grants to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was presented as a cover for measures .
yet another step further towards personal comments like this example , the image from the DR Congo using sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the painting of San@@ ge also occurred in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee ra@@ pe , ra@@ pe and some dead , some through burning .
while others reported on the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s reported as the following , which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken by a Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which were report@@ edly claimed that President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an being said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to view this information .
the original entry , which last was accessed by April 26th , 2017 , can be called here .
other news organisations which were called AF@@ P as their source , were also for@@ ged Th@@ ein Being made this statement , but did not bring the image from the DRC in connection .
the worldwide coverage of false information
traces of these false coupling dates back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rev@@ amped picture search using the search engine Tin@@ u has found 344 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images , which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h private pages , platforms social media and community publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , others have tried to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have bor@@ dered examples of the ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they were published . this way we want to represent the range clearly than by language only . &quot; &quot; &quot;
listed below are several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use from the listed countries ( in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be fully split ( on the card in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
the country examples of false copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ an@@ gled countries refer to pages or servers , over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available .
the countries in grey are examples , according to the metadata and information that are available through Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DRC was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arab ) as part of a thread for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; this article from 2014 were killed by students , who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic close to An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly explained that the picture is not from the k@@ illings , but it claims that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the picture later was in circulation by the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te it would be links to Nigeria .

the image of the DR Kongo disappeared , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dis@@ sol@@ es a discussion among Muslims in the B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took this events that were suspected in the Islamic State &apos;s name , much attention z@@ ol@@ len .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was t@@ wit@@ ched as proof for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times swe@@ pt ) , but the messages that were associated with it were taken up in no religious context .
instead , attention was to pay attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison to the media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack of Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message had been written in circulation by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos &quot; by the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , translated into circulation , as this here in Vietnamese and explained it to the folder .
from the Embassy in which the image from the DRC was included , the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Martos .
there are further examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .

( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp do exist on the web cra@@ wler and ver@@ ge on image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may eventually charge a correct description , but the original membership is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two powerful topics or frames ( frames ) that take these posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of major discussions regarding the silence of Christians through Muslims or - in the defence of Muslims , the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddhist .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
religion do not want to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth considering how images should be used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer give faith these images longer .
with social media , there are many people who have un@@ intended use to tr@@ end the water around a tragedy .
suggests that the mood of the mis@@ - and false information , that actual at@@ ro@@ cities are un@@ true and tast@@ ed the real hor@@ ror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the re@@ tention of images appears like a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , worry that violent images and spectators des@@ si@@ zing the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( for example , this study which sought to act as violent media on it , others ) .
while there is much to discuss violent concepts in the news media , fact is that they are essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
Techn@@ olog@@ ise experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you &apos;ll have to thoroughly examine the struggle against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which a picture suggests something , which is actually solved from the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but every investigation into false alle@@ g@@ ation should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simm@@ ons uses R@@ CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ man@@ age@@ able ) tries to offer a selection of words all over the world , which are difficult to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often extremely complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ ber ) .
but all are stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly in@@ sist@@ ent every attempt to a simple translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes necessary to understand what is meant by this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog , you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s VAT , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ba you for your parents in recognition of how to stri@@ ve for you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - comfort and la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you got caught on cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog :
they in@@ feed other cultures , reveal other ideas and provo@@ ke our curiosity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , you have to analyse and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Red@@ ner of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treasure &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are greatly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload your favourite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka comes with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ astrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka sees itself at the moment of the worst floo@@ ding and drow@@ ning disaster in this decade .
triggered by mon@@ soon , that usually ends in late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s came across the south and west of the country .
after a statement of the cat@@ astroph@@ ies of Sri Lanka , on May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missed due to floods and mud pots .
over 400 000 people have been affected by last Friday ( 26 May ) and roughly 100 000 people were brought to a secure stay of 304 .
the rainf@@ all were closed on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the floods in some areas declined slowly .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos con@@ vey an impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ astrophe :
high tide in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ ets provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flight wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ ke crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ ins are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of yesterday &apos;s true water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operation and five are made for transport of emergency supplies which were included in their floo@@ ded villages .
several organisations and start@@ ups have also prepared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster relief - Information desk - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require d@@ ron@@ es for their operations , please call the 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for everyone who want to don@@ ate dry food and food @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ up ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ac@@ enter is informed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ up introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high water remedy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button to call it users to pick up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ot Red Cross . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , they conducted an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key which included more than thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat response transactions to result in floo@@ ding with water and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the use of .@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute , we call par@@ oles for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ inc@@ en@@ code , we are entitled to trans@@ gress .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and humans , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ili@@ zing par@@ oles against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who know me since years , dis@@ connect me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has set up in their concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they mus@@ cled me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective vision that as soon as Muslims , as I don &apos;t fit there , be mis@@ c .
to be mis@@ ed
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images will come to a sense when you think of it ?
love ? love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea religion was deleted , just like the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reducing images of Muslims , Western books have been colon@@ ising for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
in the 1970s , Edward S@@ aid were the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid in the 1970s .
but these images also rise further today .
they continue to store our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , nar@@ rative nar@@ rative domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rative reduce reality that have led nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidency candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented to carry their head@@ scarf in public buildings and forced to cover their entire body to cover their entire body that are both sides of the same coin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women , taking movements to change .
it can be seen that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil from Afri@@ kan@@ ers who had been brought to slave war@@ ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has led our collective imagination such deep and f@@ law@@ ed that often Sik@@ h &apos;s men and children become the goal of an@@ tim@@ us@@ li@@ mic attacks and ch@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; due to these stories we can tell and because of the way that we tell them is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia today not just fear from Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these companies belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my industry has simply failed to capture the nar@@ ration of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed to make seven million Muslims who make the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious Group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live her American dream .
my mother made her first jewellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan imag@@ ined the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were in@@ hib@@ ited by Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ err@@ atic to Muslims and Americans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or to bring my hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs that all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; From the respect of Pep@@ pa W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I sh@@ am , we don &apos;t wear all the bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activ@@ ist , who ende@@ av@@ our to fight all widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ist machine , think tanks and experts for Fal@@ se information , which is our already f@@ law@@ ed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam has been manipul@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the stories we can tell and because of the way we can tell you , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger that breaks down the head@@ scarf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I want to explain that .
I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ tery church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they look back on the following terms : believe , behaviour and nationality .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my friend , my neighbour , will see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ending ritual with my daughter , when I saw her in my arms , and her Arabic verses , to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you that it is protected from evil , evil , evil one can see and evil that you cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith is probably not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grandmother &apos;s matern@@ al grandmother and her sisters , as she can win a competition of art of flowers in Kar@@ achi in decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger ; and one Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen cap@@ tains , which it can almost in@@ war@@ dly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims means the prayers which she had said to me when I had a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims to be said to me , as she taught me to relate to God : Allah , what God means , my only Lord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a people who has been founded over centuries - through an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; company , it has a profound meaning to call God , my only master . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging to grow and heard that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time to see that my own grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he writes about the modern Islam and about independence K@@ ash@@ mir &apos;s independence , N@@ ana J@@ aan said after his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close his arms in half a century .
belonging to know is that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palest@@ in@@ ians , whose families were torn apart by my grandfather , like col@@ oni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims must know that over the past two centuries Europeans have had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected by a Muslim country before a century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it meant to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an intimate , cro@@ pping underground of British Empire , was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the newspapers of his time , since it was the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before there was aircraft , he travelled to more parts of the world when I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it means that four years ago , the migh@@ ti@@ est military of the world , with troops , were disper@@ sed throughout the continent , apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , to pursue mass destruction of weapons that did not exist .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the outbreak of war .
to know an American Muslims must know that the suicide rate has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy bears the US , and the susp@@ ects bears a Muslim name , which records the story four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination .
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bal@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and placed in this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .

to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are built on this dou@@ bling structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is set up in the Muslim registry , which began President Bush , and under President Obama .
it consists of consistent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in immig@@ ration , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that close its borders towards people from the country , which bombs it bombs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely relies on Arab@@ s and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the wars which we lead , and the bombs we reject in Muslim countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study by the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of North@@ western university participants showed a scientifically un@@ true picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply disturbed , the Muslim , or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faulty and dangerous images , which we st@@ ems in our message editorial offices .
at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry that tries to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am worried because of this difficult global time point we are in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , because Muslims have taken to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; others . &quot;
a couple of years ago , she had not yet been given them ; now they gover@@ n large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am worried about the re@@ alities and history , which I did not know when I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but who made me to become an uncertain Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things I left here like a fast @-@ guy lane in my speech .

why tell us this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are run , and humans have been circul@@ ated in the public performance , four decades ago , the scientist of Stan@@ ford became a scientist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to understand ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of deliber@@ ately and un@@ aware of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it showed us a new future in which we have no presi@@ dents , while he had not bom@@ bed the chocolate cake , while he already did cap@@ ut@@ te countries and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human beings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to maintain and di@@ vis@@ er the diversity of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages will not be shared to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we accept cities which don &apos;t forget di@@ ver@@ ity - safe spaces in which citizens must not forget to belong to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often are linked to understand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , link , link . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers appear their story first in their own language and translate it in English .
even though the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their surrender and their representation is that the audience agree on it .
they call Lau@@ ghter and Emot@@ ions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Faso , who is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou , also takes the opportunity to explain the stor@@ my customs of tales of tales .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak from the bun@@ ny and the ca@@ vi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after he explained the meaning of his nav@@ el , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is that to speak to an audience , which does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares his sense of in@@ competence : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were completely with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all , who are inspired by the project , can engage with T@@ LS in order to organise their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States re@@ en@@ forcement of so@@ vereign debt
with the aim of a re@@ test of public debts of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and civil organizations involved in a mass rally ; the march started at the pu@@ rep@@ ik@@ an Capitol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( civil Front for the ne@@ ural withdrawal of the debt ) and the Eastern General Assembly of Puerto R@@ ican .
the advoc@@ ate of the re@@ en@@ forcement of the debt also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people Puerto R@@ ican calls for politicians , ties and government agencies that are responsible for debts to be held responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit@@ ing and a line committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our work conditions that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ ican ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not its .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be found with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we require immediate measures .
the island - not integrated in the national council of the US - suffer from a heavy financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Center for New Economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a gover@@ ning non @-@ profit organization with no focus on the soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed by the outside without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens &apos; danger will be rejected by the people .
the demonstration took the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the sy@@ rian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed by a year since one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives arrested the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions which he made for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , paid in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , CEO of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ duction ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective replica ) .
the book , which was published last year and licensed here , contains a number of articles that deal with free culture in the face of re@@ pression .
it &apos;s a homage to Bas@@ sel and its work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what the true costs are connected with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activists , artist , designer , developer , researcher , researcher , researcher , researcher and authors who have involved in the movements of free knowledge to look over the ne@@ b@@ ula and create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted from the directory of the Ad@@ ra prison , where he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
we have no information about its current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
since March 2012 , the Web@@ developer of Open Source and Digital Activity has been detained by Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military institution , was transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the military police bases on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court of his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi said that it was cont@@ acted on 12 November 2015 by people who settled himself as an in@@ sider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his dwelling and state remain unknown but still unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , plays a decisive role in supporting the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technical biolog@@ ist and moment@@ ary of the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
there was perhaps no one of Basel &apos;s cultural prototypes as the work he started with a group of arch@@ ae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civil activities and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and pers@@ ist influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that for ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything to it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world .
this strip @-@ train in the digital arch@@ e@@ ology and conservation has created a time cap@@ tive , which will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically the bas@@ sel has not yet been able to shut up this project so far .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life in order to dream of freedom and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace them .
I am overcome when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English , even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read and speak English well , to write and speak .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him . he has taught other in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated , reading English , to write and speak .
Bas@@ sel has opened my gate to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he has also taught other int@@ act as they use computers , at least in theory without it actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a pro@@ sab@@ le@@ cloth , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for one year .
she mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabian horse into English .
the book is not available .

it is happening on every visit ,
that I sun@@ k in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the rec@@ ess in the moment , in which we embrace it ,
that any danger doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , bo@@ ilers and guards
I forget the prison of the prison
and I &apos;ll sing in every detail of your voice and words
I can carry my passion with my passion ,
if your eyes fail to say
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I will return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,

basic story is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , since the beginning of protests in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared .
those who were arrested , or under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or executed .
until 2016 , Am@@ nesty International has died in prison according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption , the head on the forec@@ los@@ sal is again on forec@@ asted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption in which a government member returned to the employment of state apparatus in which the corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other accused , due to tre@@ sp@@ per@@ sion of 54 million Met@@ ac@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds from the Mos@@ ambi@@ k airports , which Chief Cam@@ b@@ aza , between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his return to the company , which happened on April 19 , too .
in accordance with a statement of the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General , there would be no obst@@ acle reason for Cam@@ b@@ aza to re@@ vo@@ ke his old post , since the company had not performed any disciplinary trial after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants don &apos;t miss the promotion .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency , sentenced in an interview with the German wave the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our law system , so the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we know is that the company should have to initi@@ ate a disciplinary action against the respon@@ dents .
the firm seems to be silent , however , and causes no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would have been a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had eaten .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ ech@@ es , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
however , since he is in@@ competent , he has unanim@@ ously approved to re@@ integrate into the company which he helped harm .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
ir@@ resist@@ ible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of Political Sciences in Brazil says , the director has no moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State , because he did not believe it , I can &apos;t believe someone who has already ins@@ ulted the state as massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als and serve to serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served in the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as a trade itself is getting tired of money and the state itself is getting tired of that man and finally condemned to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this guy was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a thief was in prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , but not only as the first independent President in memory , but also as a sharp , single @-@ cutter and - next to say - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he was vig@@ or@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of selling his own amb@@ itions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes that this is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn away from its amb@@ itions .
a more ambitious man is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also dis@@ mis@@ sive :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years off and escaped .
and today the company relies on him , in which he is taking money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - ( @ az@@ mal _ ra@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocked the ra@@ cial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users with iniquity .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ ke .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the famous social network took their Post@@ s from the web because they contained the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or in general as ad@@ jec@@ tiv &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or in Latin America ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese ) as part of an initiative to cross the widespread problem of h@@ ass@@ ort@@ ation in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical Nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely variable con@@ not@@ ations .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra Nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the efforts to fight H@@ ass@@ us in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself is not calling out automatically .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also post@@ s , in which they have discussed the use of the word or in doubt for his use , were cen@@ sored .
Moreover , there are several bur@@ ial words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese even &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ hin@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ it A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was er@@ ased today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , though he could prove his back pain as he made a p@@ un .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the proposition ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ er ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - re@@ sembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ech@@ ing is the opinion that she will reduce h@@ ass@@ us radi@@ k@@ aler nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analysis must be more analytical , before it proceeds to the sus@@ pic@@ ion in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
the word is automatically fil@@ tering .
the automat@@ ism will not understand what you write on fac@@ ebook .
what it should be done is to analyze the mail carefully and check it by checking the existing words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( switch b@@ usses ) .
the good thing is that these tri@@ cky nation@@ alists spreading a fairly good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the promotion is a powerful signal to all send , the efficiency of this strategy may not take long .
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have proved that the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or alternative writing of the common word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his post@@ s when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... as I was aware of this new directive by Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ on@@ ically , my post from Facebook was removed and the li@@ ken , post and sharing of Content was prohibited for 24 hours because of the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook Community Standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a multitude of Post@@ s from people who do not have negative inten@@ tions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with language :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his mind about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are po@@ or@@ ly in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community about advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work like that .
such words can be cen@@ sored only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if it started without a local context or technical support and as words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ ed@@ cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they did mistake , they did not temp@@ t the fal@@ si@@ fied Post@@ s .
if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefit they would have a great turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has cat@@ ered for much sp@@ inning among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users can now make fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if her post@@ s are taken away from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post@@ ings , which were not contained in any language , but still being removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch as her@@ cur@@ cur@@ ry and watch a Indian film .
only to try out if Facebook contains the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; if you are a doctor , if you are a doctor , do you then cure people ? &quot;

over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies , and religious fundament@@ alists , have used social networks to extend their votes and influence .
among others , working language in social networks to heat the violence in the con@@ greg@@ ations in Myanmar in particular , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ized for his failure to bring out bal@@ ancing amb@@ itions on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control .
but rather than just to c@@ ens@@ or the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been more current to look more on the context as on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .

the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament in Parliament voted unanim@@ ously a law that has to offer this practice , so that the age @-@ able age is now 18 .
prior to this change of the sp@@ ouse , there were some members of Hindu religi@@ on@@ ism at the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country assembled , that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state , because it is not the maturity of the maturity . &quot;
this happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ tor of the UN child &apos;s prevention , the min@@ ors as well as defined by people under the age of 18 .
the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical Federal Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married among 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that were trying to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s before , followed at the foot , and rejo@@ iced with great support . no doubt , they helped to bring this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hindu leader , for example , had no concern to tell the critics of the children before they should take care of their own business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sort of religious opposition was an intri@@ c@@ ate thing for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated cause , and at some point , dou@@ bts about whether the opposition would agree with the bill of law .
but early in 2017 , the bill of law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who ab@@ stain@@ ed , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where an easy majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a Status update to Facebook , which wrote Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against the children &apos;s before was launched in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one was by the only one .
once it has been decided in the Senate , the draft will now become the law .
the majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minister of Minist@@ ers in the Ministry of Education , said :
there is too much time and unnecessary talk about that the core of the business has veil@@ ed , but know what ? the child &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago , and that is worth nearly every price .
while Abel &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to take off the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally arrived :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
fol@@ ks Mut@@ ota , who belong to Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society , which said openly about it , how important is the law of the law , noted :
the Trinidad and Tobago age @-@ able age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religion of 18 years .
the proposal to change the sp@@ ouse was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 deputy in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were against were approved for the law .
the children &apos;s before is prohibited in Trinidad and Tobago no longer allowed .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ age@@ isch@@ ar@@ son .
many thanks to all activists who have led him out .
congratulations .
a thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but there is a possible hook in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Mu@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to under@@ take purpos@@ eful steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to have his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law said it was absolutely right when Mahar@@ aj was working against the law , most social media users wished for a debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion in general , in a way that can only address the state in our bedroom , that it may be mis@@ used to say that they may be mis@@ used by major , hard @-@ s@@ worn men that are opposed to them compared to the advantage , would you be prepared to carry out the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
however , if it comes to a judi@@ cial procedure against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s laws are legal or still the norm , even though it exists .

by the mirrors of websites Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English language course was presented on 18 January 2012 , contra@@ dic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over one month the Turkey has been locked the popular and at the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based En@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia .
day out day is more clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series watches against the lock .
although many techniques used are used to use c@@ anned tools for blocked web sites ( a recent article from the New York Times agre@@ es that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not drop in this category .
although Turkey has been post@@ pon@@ ed from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , you will find regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform found all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is not call@@ able despite the legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( via the lock of Wikipedia ) , we put all of these snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to IP@@ FS Platform . thus , the possibility of reading the content to dec@@ entr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org website .
IP@@ FS also showed that this stage was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pe@@ .org , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when protected in the country Wikipedia .
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices , as well as members of Mozilla at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Contest &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
it is access@@ ing a different URL that &apos;s not the original . that is what you can see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server continues on request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see contents from Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ es@@ ian Wildlife photographer uses his camera to make attentive to the need for nature protection
a cho@@ ke r@@ hin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around him , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motives and washed colours .
this motiv@@ ates him to carry him a camera with itself , trying to try the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring himself to the international stage in Nepal .
and his home town directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direc@@ ts attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps with his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home , when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my Father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately started to cra@@ ck@@ le pictures ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sag@@ ar aims to obtain global recognition of the authorities in order to obtain global recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and would like to realize that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious than they look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he should know it , because he was in the face of the tiger with face to face :
a tiger cannot distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep anymore ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I also went home because of darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ si@@ ks appeared . he immediately calls us and he star@@ es me through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited 22 days long , and usually lived in a tent to take pictures at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger for six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , Indian women for the first time to speak their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
an revised version was re @-@ published as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India there are women concerned with greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands , or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women that they should respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should respect the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a p@@ seu@@ do@@ dish and spur@@ red by her family and the village community after having named a married relatives .
tradition is also not common to name their wives by name , it is also common among men . however , they have far fewer approaches to fear , if any of them should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them healthcare , and house@@ wives , a unique club , were thus quickly becoming the main topic of the city .
it is a place just for them alone to discuss and discuss the enemy of the Patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs , which in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is set up for the mining of Patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera , such as children &apos;s pag@@ an up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs .
it reports about how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and they simultaneously made amb@@ ass@@ uring of the wall .
the first video that the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round , did not mention of women who do not call their hus@@ bands .
she decided on this topic , because she wanted to open a conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with an issue that women can easily identify themselves .
to express the names of their hus@@ bands , a Br@@ auch , who has pleaded not guilty of all , and have never put into question .
Roh@@ ini means :
these traditions test@@ i@@ fies that a woman wants her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t hold this is considered dec@@ eit@@ fully , as woman without mor@@ ality .
tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made thoughts about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never mentioned her husband , have never been called by name , try at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother in law and my husband are silent for a long time , after the video was over .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should name him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ gage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to put the discussion with a practice .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everybody , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they mean that they may not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ asts of a century @-@ old tradition , who married women to their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise just before him ; a others decided to release the whole stub@@ born fru@@ str@@ ation against him and his family by cursed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
in addition , even in ad@@ renal@@ ine exchange with an ancient Br@@ it , the women decided that they would actually try home to call their hus@@ bands in their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into the head , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife could not stop his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother in law she star@@ ed , she was afraid , and said that it was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
an husband &apos;s husband was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the car@@ cin@@ ct red point on the forehead , which shows the marriage status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the chin @-@ red dot if he did .
he only laugh@@ ed and I heard that to carry him .
the other women have not completely stopped but they think they are now in a better position to be able to carry him on some days .
for many women , the discussion group is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing an excursion at every discussion group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I do not want to worry about the women who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days in her life with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I also talked about some things , for example as our ident@@ ities to our hus@@ bands , have never been said to be honest .
it feels great to say things no@@ isy , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is for their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine c@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users , they have not dar@@ ed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clos@@ ets , the mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , mu@@ g@@ ing@@ ed Roh@@ ini ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that women could carry them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion group has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are getting slow into the roles : &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far we have just made small steps .
some women tested it a few times , but then we listened to the name of their husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry a Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in a discussion group know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like going through more freedom of movement or their own clos@@ ets - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they realize they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I &apos;m also there .
but this club is each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it &apos;s not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club following home and other people , what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all in the same boat .

the first Japan &apos;s visit to the popular band The Beatles celebrated a commemor@@ ative day with commem@@ oration
the Beatles with her landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
on June 29 , this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag would be able to find the a@@ ash@@ tag in the Japanese fair@@ way ( Beatles Day ) on the Japanese Twitter trend where many fans gave memories and shared their este@@ em for the Beatles .
the visit of the Beatles in 1966 is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , re@@ marked the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for almost five days the Beatles had been in the country but this was enough to pass through the Japanese .
the man here has become quite clear that they were no other choice when the Beatles received open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! the Today is the Beatles Day in Japan . it was in Tokyo here for 51 years ago .
today , songs from the Beatles are still sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes in Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beatles survived everything .
today it is a memorial day .
we all love in our house the Beatles .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John Lenn@@ on is to be portra@@ yed or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places that are connected with the band .
if you love the Beatles , you are your 5 places you need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( museum ) , Liverpool
sometimes the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can &apos;t be quir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today it is a memorial day .
exactly today in the year 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the Film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies also use the fan base to be market@@ able , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! the Today is The Beatles Day .
and what could be a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ our@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I will eat R@@ amen pasta at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the day is going to run today .
so , we hope you are doing that !

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ trading , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , probably wor@@ ries the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government called for a number of operations in life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the borough of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from Malawi .
one of the victims were be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently saw that the bodies of sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
it also give the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a gl@@ itter@@ ing man of gold could bring wealth or wealth , the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that the following attacks were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of mur@@ ders for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN in the South African country in 2016 to examine these practical issues .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government campa@@ ig@@ ning to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ judi@@ ce pre@@ judi@@ ces .

he warned those who proposed to travel to the country :

two susp@@ ects were arrested in the District of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ ination took place .
Hus@@ hai Lag@@ y Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city of In@@ h@@ amb@@ ane , south of Mozambique , said that local police are already going to follow the case :
PR@@ M believes that sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of gl@@ itter@@ ing men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of gl@@ itter@@ ing individuals in Mor@@ ale bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for probably super@@ st@@ itious rit@@ u@@ als , has cultural motives , and is assumed by the traditional sh@@ am@@ ans of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also agre@@ es that a belie@@ ver exists , according to which the victims had power in their heads , the wealth of wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair@@ less problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha divided the Chronicle of the Blo@@ g@@ gers arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , which is clear that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Mozambique is facing :

free Bas@@ sel : Net@@ i@@ zen under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and dis@@ sident Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which probably was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to international community awareness after his lawyer was announced in late June , that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver canc@@ ers in the hospital .
in 2009 Liu was condemned to eleven years in prison because of &quot; Subversion &quot; ( nationality ) , after having responded to the design of the Charter of 08 , a manifest@@ o that demands democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker told , he considered it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , free to allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ized the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ dened the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has merged several reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ eid R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met by the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Liu abroad a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister in Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s liberation .
the relationship between China and Norway got into force after the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian Government approved that it ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations were finally continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to absor@@ b the salmon and exports to China , since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the message that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee presented his hope for a conditional release to expression and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo .
due to his arrest , he was unable to meet his prize .
during the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament approved a decision in which China was promp@@ ted to free his house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the chief diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called China also for the release Li@@ us , as she ha@@ sted in a statement on 30 June :
we also expect China to raise all constra@@ int of Mr Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
the USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to him that he has the opportunity to treat them abroad , in so far as he was to help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speaker from the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P was released on June 27 , that the message was to release Chinese authorities but not only Liu free but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia free from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy with@@ drew a fur@@ ious answer from China after itself , with the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Land has the right to be able to implement and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom like travel security and access to medical care of its choice , to which they have claims according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mercury and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision to push for the Chinese government to push for Liu and his wife un@@ conditi@@ on@@ ally .
I ask China to un@@ conditi@@ on@@ ally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that he can be@@ have in a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin I hope that Liu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support which he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was published on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing news agency that China had great concerns on whether the vort@@ ex around Liu was over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , calling the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China invited Professor to provide adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to re@@ strain himself from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ us Ms. , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it does not allow Liu to speak with anyone outside , including its lawyers , talking and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Canada , China ur@@ ges China to safegu@@ ard its international human rights committed , including freedom of expression , and for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France
French Foreign Office asked China to release Liu from humanitarian motives on 29 June :
all necessary measures need to be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments , which he needs , regardless where , requires his wife and his family to him .
though the news conference of France would already say that the French government Liu would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was announced that France will eventually receive no further information if France will eventually take him up .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Agricultural Affairs in Taiwan started ane@@ w on June 27 , Liu liber@@ ate and to show a greater tolerance towards those responsible for peaceful political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ ai@@ wan@@ ese Legisl@@ ative Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic progress Party also called China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a declaration on June 28 by Liu very worried and gave that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us Well@@ being .
he said about Liu :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that he took and was punished to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and weal@@ thy China , which again would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt very moving and encour@@ aging me when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , who stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question seems stupid , since Singapore is recognised as an independent state .
but according to Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore was to be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister knew that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports Singapore to be regarded as a city .
... no one asked questions whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , where most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to turn the logic in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and asc@@ ending to create this valuable land , we can say that we don &apos;t have any country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape before the answer , a bre@@ ach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my land , whose country is it ?
the reasons presented by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; ordinary countries &apos; , in view of it , he seemed un@@ democratic un@@ democratic .
however , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian leaders will be appearing , leaving deser@@ ted logic , because it suits her power .
at the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am they were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ t , our political system really non @-@ responses .
appropriate questions , he clo@@ aked with non @-@ answer r@@ ational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am pointing out his opinion , as they did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city is , so to which country is our city ...
short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would take up the effort to clear this point unless it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by discuss@@ ing his comment on the blog , he suggests that the whole of the conference should begin to understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the heading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so much easier , even if we are happy and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he spent Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
as he said , Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , as leader of a Her@@ an@@ growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said it is very busy ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - unless I agree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have dou@@ bts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK review dis@@ covers the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
does Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; gut@@ ted a mistake &quot; or was it a mis@@ erable man ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , what land does the so@@ vereign rights of the city go back to Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the governmental treaty , the testim@@ onies of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance .
why are the Singap@@ urer present their military service , but do they defend their city only ?
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten@@ ds the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade to affir@@ mation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Singapore is always a town : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have upset many Singap@@ urer ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we &apos;ve always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the land mainly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the city &apos;s defence .
the myth of the &quot; nice can@@ adian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most ab@@ used aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous line , with the rum@@ ors over certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et shall be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is made to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live and live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the discussion takes place , it is regarded as courte@@ ous to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my clari@@ fication , the default response is usually follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadian should cook to anger if they are kept for Americans , but it doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for anyone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadian residents are well visible at their ruck@@ sack when travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , however , ... .
it was also when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
equal marri@@ ages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada shall also be regarded as the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as such types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate doing that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t do anything if you would like to switch to Johnny from Dallas by example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael made of Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the punch &quot; nice . &quot;
fir@@ stly , as &quot; nice &quot; means to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be di@@ lig@@ ently - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders , &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one of his Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no edges and edges , nothing in which you can stum@@ ble .
being harmless , means to be in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from things that happen around one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major partner of the Canadian is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own business .
what other than &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence across the fence .
we are missing the warm heart@@ y , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadian is more than just &quot; nice &quot; and our Prime Minister has made Canada down@@ less sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ res Thail@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that took hold of the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite its promises to revi@@ ve the civil government .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him of his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video in@@ directly rel@@ ates to the persist@@ ed military dom@@ ination of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook only 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 likes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists ask the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to Thai politics , in particular , as it is capable of holding the country &apos;s situation under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of videos , which relate to some of the political topics that have been pursued in Thailand over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which was given the commander of absolute decision @-@ making about important national themes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture above reflects the implementation of the law on computer criminal , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules often be explo@@ ited by the authorities for activ@@ ist and other critic of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a new unit in the army has been instit@@ uted , super@@ vised by the online content and were accused of having committed monarchy to have been prosec@@ uted .
Thailand is a strict sense against &quot; the Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ esty of Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continue to buy is their decision expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax purposes .
in the video it is even shown how persons are thrown into a black delivery van , before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are sitting in prison because they are supp@@ os@@ edly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and with Internet users get long arrest pun@@ ches , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band members of the band , which was im@@ itated by Sal@@ ut &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war company re@@ covers only very slowly in East @-@ Asia Minor , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the deser@@ ted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show marked pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ pool of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , sealing Asia , Geor@@ gios and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , most Russians and destruction are living in the area .
these sett@@ lements are also called ghost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people still lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the county was 16@@ ,000 people after having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ t@@ schu@@ kow@@ kas , symbo@@ lic@@ ally symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and rarely are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s getting hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why speak ?
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and nur@@ ser@@ y , which served all of the community .
now there is only a paved road with gl@@ az@@ ed spl@@ end@@ or @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived on this place lived and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , meanwhile , have left the district .
the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha are about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which is one or two families , one can recognize at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look from the windows of a destroyed home .
when she dis@@ covering me with the camera in my hand , they immediately move back .
&quot; our mother is forbidden to let us photograph , &quot; one of the girls said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply has forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her girl a little girl and suddenly she abandoned the destruc@@ tive building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence business ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the District Administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
about ten years ago a older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as they are called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left the ch@@ as@@ ies to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in ab@@ as@@ ies , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept financial support from her daughter and ai@@ ved her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if you are a holiday , we visit us .
but we can &apos;t do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls forth A@@ unt G@@ alya her . &quot; they said , &quot; We could build zu@@ cchini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha worked together with her husband and five children living in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day she rem@@ inded of the village of the village before the war .
despite the relatives we live in Central Russian , Os@@ set@@ ia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

Nat@@ asha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
her husband is working in the cab@@ bage .
the young family has its own farm .
close to the house where Nat@@ ascha Kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens .

many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has a lot to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived like it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that the city and the war were once a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our talk ten@@ ds to the end a little boy bl@@ amed over us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des himself .
a ball flies from the window and another boy ch@@ ased him .
he plays with the ball , which then rolled up the hill .
a group of children now followed the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the exp@@ iring buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide integrity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it different .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses in their long journey

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places will be known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year old Mexican , a small woman with a grain @-@ pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ eck and golden earrings in t@@ eddy bear .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many below the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approx . 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , bri@@ dged walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - but hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants arrive here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told , people arrive in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you from Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cart@@ ons .
she wants to refuse to anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines that they can &apos;t pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long trip exhau@@ st@@ ion .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ urt camp ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel really that it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston , to get her husband and the three children .
you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards North .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other pione@@ ers of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a famous name on the route , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his pione@@ ers , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to get the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez told that her guests often send text messages to gr@@ ate them or to report on the course of her trip .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught her to prepare h@@ ens like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ kle hope for migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have res@@ cu@@ ed migrants in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and found that the bus ticket to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and cooking facility outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests pass through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the wilderness and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents , also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to comp@@ ress the money from him without having a plan .
in tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , one single @-@ known one , has offered her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives and tried to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the lengths the trav@@ ellers look quietly their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has got 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ ma she bl@@ ends her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ s who made her a rally , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , Young and Old .
she laughs sadly , while she imag@@ ines her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ one , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang hab@@ it@@ ants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
check Point for Personal Communications in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ Users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the phone user in Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it has sign@@ alled the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this message , the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities have also used to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture because they had installed the app , after having replaced the app , messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the notification of police , the app could identify and follow the sources and distribution channels of terror@@ ists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the block@@ age of the por@@ no@@ graphic web site , from online fraud , Troj@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users alert on how much time they spend online in order to re@@ control the home network .
this app , with the filters for min@@ ors , should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions may naturally be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operators or even hack@@ ers managed to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China are mostly focusing on the experience of users in the larger towns in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , op@@ pressed ethnic minority regions , such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , authorities often call extreme ignition and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely internet cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from China China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the cen@@ sored news in China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented photographs by a Check@@ point where polic@@ emen were spe@@ ech@@ less checked if they had installed the monitored App . &quot; &quot; &quot;
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days .
if you &apos;re looking at a check point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
that is a blow for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tive through the transition technology .
we are back again in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from the China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cop@@ per State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , in addition , published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which it can lift the software requirement of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are connected to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are perhaps a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government branches , authorities and institutions including universities and research institutions , including universities and research institutions , are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computer and communication instruments .
a recent report from Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this action does , however , viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives pen@@ alties for a whole series of other potential prizes , including such those interested in peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane was sign@@ posted his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you watch and specify that you are all alone at one place where all important is van@@ ished .
everything has been gradually dis@@ b@@ anded and a truth revealed , which is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one who makes her name all honor .
one who has failed in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if the reality turns out , and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - transform the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all dou@@ bts will dissolve in smoke , and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is caught up on the axis of the evil , you are clear that you are among the walls that you have built here among the walls , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but it wasn &apos;t enough to make &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as chief of security service it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he introduced his power as proof , as he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five teen@@ agers have been torn out of peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to break the town dark night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the districts were cov@@ eted , not my own .
for the first time , it was quiet , reg@@ al , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city , which is fed to the arter@@ ies with national security organisms and their complic@@ es .
in the third night , things had to say something to work after the power supply heard in the quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , by crying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice contra@@ dic@@ ts through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends took to me ; we alli@@ ed to a splendid picture that had filled up my expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment , you realize that you are liberated from the lamp , but it &apos;s not interested in the least . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after finding it all the way until the office of safety from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ lin was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ assan starts to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear , as you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough , if we are not in the vicinity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes set up upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to see what to look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
maybe it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps on the Revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had@@ n &apos;t thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fat@@ ally consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father right away with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is right away with that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this curse lies to me until today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture that I was exposed for months .
I sc@@ out the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gang to the single cells .
I can tell me all details exactly , before I take care of the room .
otherwise they have assigned a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one another prisoner and may immediately put me in use , without waiting her permission .
after a few minutes felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I went back to an old proven communication method : to strike your f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my spo@@ res was a &quot; tri@@ f@@ ling . &quot;
after a long time , he answered me ultimately .
apparently there was in none of the surrounding cells a rep@@ utable man of medium age , which looks similar to me and &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , there are no notable faces on me , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like me ? &quot;
all answers are linked to its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the big cells .
maybe he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars . a liar .
I would have liked to drive a scar@@ ec@@ row to ban@@ ish all these cro@@ ws , spread across the fruit in the garden of my head .
from the distance I can still cry out &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around the time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve always been convinced that black the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light , which showed us the hor@@ ror in person : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( about : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you are here to hear . &quot;
that was the secret to protect the secret of us : to protect and prevent the terror@@ ists and terror@@ ists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ty dial@@ ect - and thus they played their sec@@ ession@@ ist black@@ mailing list and res@@ cu@@ ed the narrow view@@ point of their world view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a country , which is no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ exist@@ ance to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ an into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cared for the audi@@ ble room and meet Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and pointed man ; at least he comes to me so much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can start feeling so much more important with your life as you join this day@@ time and protest against demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have grown acc@@ ust@@ omed to me , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws are made for a friendly conversation to me on ordinary means of communication .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me told me that I had to get acc@@ ust@@ omed to get punished if I had done nothing to earn this penalty .
upon punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , probably st@@ ems from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker takes you to your cri@@ es .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot keep your cry .
my scre@@ am hasn &apos;t played it enough , so why they ex@@ changeable the pipe through an cable .
during my first arrest I asked me whether the investig@@ ator had been working earlier than a garbage dump or if it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had mixed four cables in each other to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice also , which is why I ceased to cry .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling and did not feel any pleasure in this way , which is why it comes next to an electri@@ cally loaded rod .
power through my whole body , enough to store my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ cra@@ cker body that stretched out on the ground was the perfect power director .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had filled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to put my sleep again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens , and the morning light meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering the voice of an exhau@@ sting yo@@ ungst@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be terri@@ bly worried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and walk you , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had free set free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
this photo was taken from A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes over the most of its time inside ; sometimes he will kill himself to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ otine with@@ drawn lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house which has heard them since 1967 ; the year , when Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s family came to flee from their village in Palestine , where she had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmer ) .
for more than six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who inter@@ pret@@ ended the conservative majority and inter@@ acts their final opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his music , who deals often with issues such as Oriental peace , rac@@ ism and the situation of the entire Arab world . all these topics can not only be found in his home town of Amman , but also in cities that from Damascus all to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking , and can cooperate according to their own statement with people who have suffered from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not give it openly , he won a special inc@@ lin@@ ation against American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his studio at his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian anti @-@ fle@@ ction of the second generation - so he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own living conditions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured out the nest in water in two cups , it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from dawn to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness of breaking down ancient traditions . on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a scor@@ ching hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the m@@ hole talk with a warm coffee and the wa@@ x@@ ion of Kent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one casts a look into neighbouring countries .
thus , it simply avo@@ ids basic things to do - as in public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to not land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary elections , supporting the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed the Muslim branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual fron@@ tier , Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ ct the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and be the main reason for the concert tab@@ ula .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former press officer of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world is hazardous ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m that asks the old proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a rated the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which remains committed to an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably be not simply fl@@ atter@@ ed rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but in fact a clear cryst@@ all@@ ine reality is clearly conflic@@ ting , which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s traditional spiritual nor@@ ms came to body by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ ventive sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a obviously woo@@ ded unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who should actually trust .
in the past years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; hon@@ oring &apos; hon@@ oring - the un@@ official outside .
human rights Watch according to Human Rights Watch , however , reached its peak in 2016 ; however , Jordan is still controversial that Jordan has become institu@@ tional infrastructure to support the women who were victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law for inter@@ ru@@ ptions in 1954 , women who are exposed to danger of domestic violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may in@@ definitely be detained in prison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for her release is often a lon@@ gl@@ ary bureau@@ cratic expense and the guarantee of the family requires nothing to happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for that , also not rever@@ e to topics , which in its country long as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b argu@@ ed that his work is politically , but dre@@ aming that he &apos;s his music , which is full of explic@@ it announ@@ cements on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was tried by politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lies the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs , which are political in the core , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse appears quite often :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that can get what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noticed that hardly anybody in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were sharp@@ ly cen@@ sored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya to note later that his comments were torn out from the context , twi@@ sted and his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a re@@ worked version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ qui@@ res the Arab LGB@@ T + community and represents the opinion that In@@ tolerance towards homosexu@@ als did not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century who still stayed in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should work later once on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , was able to write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , didn &apos;t do anything with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the H@@ asch@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attack on freedom of expression and that progressive votes will be sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service took several former government members and members of the teaching association , with the reas@@ oning , they had focused on comments in social media , related to the deeply ro@@ oted corruption .
in view of this , h@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s concert is only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is a constant giving and take . Jordan is now denied a gig , but the way of progress - so it looks great , demand and inn@@ ate changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s , is also from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is not only dre@@ aming of taking his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will help with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental op@@ enness - and not through bombs , streams , and artificial way organized demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he is hoping it .
until it is so far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to rest and therefore also resist the resistance .

one thought that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually taken over in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the drums and dancing are covered over a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to conquer the knee .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can imagine only how big these parts are ...

seldom , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this history , because they are helping to cope with Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair war@@ der .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical center of Lima , in a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ b and illegal drugs trading are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region cannot feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - how many other medi@@ oc@@ - and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , N@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , N@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , and N@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dresser they can make up this elabor@@ ate hair@@ dos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the exceptional demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , even an annual event inspired , the competition of hair@@ dresser &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are experts opposite each other , to show who can create one of them the most cent@@ ric len@@ ooks that can be seen in the following video ( further videos on current competitions this is available on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people , replacing their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain an apprentic@@ eship in hair@@ style art , which makes it possible to find work .
motivated by this activity and the bid@@ ding possibilities , dozens of people have seen that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
at the beginning of March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only specialist in the community and the district , what we are very proud of , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ fighter

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ messenger of gu@@ err@@ illa &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we just write love letters to people who know ?
is it not yet much more import@@ antly , people who feel e@@ jected to accommodate affection ?
exactly this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the head of Bog@@ ot@@ art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the head and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ a@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , who encouraged young people to write letters .
only recently , their country was setting up an historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the Guer@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces in Colombia ) , which forms the point of point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered the signing of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a long way ahead of Colombia , until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ ov , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , and around the clock contributed their weapons to the life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , again , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases , they have to record in their ranks and support them when building up a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that young Colombia would close together and assist in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa , to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ atic fighter - who then should be handed over .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , held in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we write people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need much more need@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he plan , he said further to share his love with people this year who needed most urgent assur@@ ances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC bands , who now have to build their place in society and build a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course from a history of peace to a joint history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the United Nations in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
a group of 40 students of the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ kind traveled into the camp to personal the letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the ARC set themselves as they had previously done to receive the orders of their leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this time they did not receive any prec@@ epts , but letters full of people from all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings are going through - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the schol@@ ar student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter s@@ led me through the camp of the Guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where gu@@ err@@ illa lives ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ atic fights , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos; a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life somebody has something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; suddenly I walked through the che@@ eks over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him completely and set myself next to the Gren@@ at@@ cher .
perhaps he was sorry , he was sorry for all the years of faithful compan@@ ions to be this strug@@ gles , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else expected from life . he was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now I know that there is a society outside that awaits us with open arms .
until now , I have learned only how I have to handle weapons .
but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion group .
the students were all grown up as war , and the F@@ ARC was already hidden .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC run the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the whole of the peace process . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can contribute to a society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this mag@@ n@@ itude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people have never heard the hearing before , and no elec@@ toral law , and to recognize that people who had often been seen as monsters and even hate people who were surrounded by their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ oods and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reality , where the country is living , hur@@ ts to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it comforts me that all men - also those who have killed and caused so much harm to us and give us a smile and a hug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian people was proph@@ es@@ ied that after dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would prevail .
but this is not the case .
as long as it exists ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to stand up and protest for their rights and that &apos;s completely justified ( ... ) .
we of F@@ ARC rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence are many difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on our way there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them together .

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ mak@@ er@@ owa and published its first publication in the website of OC Media .
hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
in terror , activists in the past months have witnessed over the persecution of gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on how a Dam@@ oc@@ les@@ worth above the LGB@@ T community is not only created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published , which have access the tow@@ age , torture and murder of que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ ati@@ zed .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ ch@@ n@@ yan authorities that took susp@@ icious Que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
ever since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was educated , you knew that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a secure place for her , which was why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens were experienced by the gender equality of their farm , the hunt for Sabrina recently opened .
for fear about her life she moved to the US last end .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per at a human rights organisation .
one day , someone was told that somebody needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while I was trying to help her , I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there were no more men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya that can fix this shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on October 10 , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just about getting a few shopping places from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honour the family , you sweat ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person not .
I only know that there was a young man , no more than 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up the last du@@ des in the hospital again .
apparently some women had received everything and started to write .
the man was fled .
the women had called a n@@ urses .
in the hospital , I realized that I had two samples in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which n@@ urses have you laid - in which the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him for being resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
at last February , I got thre@@ ats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stranger , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neigh@@ bors and some distant relatives .
the requested to send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they asked them , &quot; Some said to me , &quot; I must prove it , by running up without through the streets ; others said that I didn &apos;t change my sex in the official television that everything was just bad @-@ speech , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people once said my mother on the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not just your family , but the entire republic is ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out wife , but you must van@@ ish from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much , and she put a rope around his neck .
fortunately , the neigh@@ bors and saved them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , a car was placed under the window with a dar@@ kened window discs and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , I was clear that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you bra@@ ided ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all , they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable .
I still can &apos;t understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I had arrived .
I bought you , without registration , without notice , without having anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it in the tr@@ ash .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I was using the SIM card to my mobile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe in security only because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know already in which hotel you hide . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about sexual intercourse , this is a tab@@ oo theme .
I still carry some traditional k@@ cas@@ ian elements in me .
so very much I wish I can not overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I really give me to@@ il , like the person to look out of their past - so remember my male shape .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed in ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for the I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who joined the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an had no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he didn &apos;t shut up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what I think , they probably load the relative , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced blood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : will there now be gay men in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says that there would be just not many .
if , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to make the Kad@@ y@@ rows dish .
as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can represent later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies under TV and claim they could have attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply dis@@ appearing , but purpos@@ ed to radic@@ alizing themselves .
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who imprisoned one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new about them since .
they simply took them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , who was involved in himself as these people were taken .
until now , they have not been presented as a band@@ its until now there were yet no reports . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why wouldn &apos;t you have this man allowed to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ies of people who have heard of so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , were already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always bore my hair long .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think I was already familiar with Gros@@ ny in 2003 , when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally int@@ end to bring us back to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civi@@ lization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows were cl@@ oned ; I had dy@@ ed lashes , bore pipes and short tops .
the sh@@ aria &apos;s security ministry has never bent me a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people as met me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never ins@@ ulted .
in the Che@@ ch@@ n@@ yan language there is a turning point : as Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte doesn &apos;t say about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children , if they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just got their eyes closed from you because they believed you were sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted me , never ch@@ ased , never ch@@ ased .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on the mor@@ ality of mor@@ ality .
he spoke not about us , but primarily on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
who suffered and laugh@@ ed at once and laugh@@ ed at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
during the time , I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you think now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the United States .
apart from that , I am still working as activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ated with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , gath@@ er@@ ings , I beg@@ ining them to the hospital and help them to get food @-@ cards .
I don &apos;t have to pay a p@@ enny .
I have discovered these people himself , when I was a curse se@@ ap@@ per@@ ated .
I am Muslims and I would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sabrina : it is al@@ ic@@ kers .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens who want to tell you foam with foam , that there is no h@@ ow@@ ls at them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Cab@@ ard@@ iner who have the Russians also , on the whole planet they are - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it is un@@ pleasant to hear s@@ ow@@ as .
I meet here so many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - pract@@ ising Muslims who go to the mosque and fast@@ en and live together with men during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
you know , many think in tran@@ si@@ veness of men who love men , and they believe that they are his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a key .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact , different living settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not feel ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n to an increase of self @-@ murder within the pover@@ ished Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ or region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arabian workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named Jas@@ si@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had one child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to stop the in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous .
a video released on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people made it fast to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken into the Tal@@ eg@@ a hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors did nothing more to do .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that took place in August within the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i minority , and activ@@ ist on the spot , before that more men could take life .
this month &apos;s Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - were up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their stories have one thing together : there were all family gath@@ er@@ ings , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to pursue their families and pursue a safe job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arab Ah@@ mad@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where most of those in Iran live in the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , making it difficult to deny the local Arab population .
in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy increased the power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable utility areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population suff@@ ers only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and discharge .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Arab@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s system@@ atically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are lying .
these dam@@ me have led only to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region by d@@ rought them to destroy local farming and palm trees and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab @-@ Hawai@@ ian yo@@ ungst@@ ers now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operative , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ is who completed elementary school , completed elementary school , 55 % an advanced school and 45 % have a degree in university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist , resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; said to a &quot; high rise &quot; of self @-@ murder among young Ah@@ mad men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse and the reason for this is a combination of a high number of civilians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the production process :
since func@@ tionary and institutions are preferred to set Arab workers , the local Arabian Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and to for@@ ge their living being outside of their home ancest@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are people who had to hide their pros and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i and are not toler@@ ated as Arabic name at work cannot be toler@@ ated , because the speech of Arabic language or wearing arab@@ ic clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , strike rights activists alert before the situation is explosive .

&quot; why I identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the comments written by Ay@@ om@@ ide zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions appeared .
you can read in the comments using the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react , especially white women , which call themselves as an inter@@ section femin@@ ists - with fru@@ str@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put out well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money in spite of the same formation than men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they may do with their bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women pick up a glass ceiling earlier or later in various fields of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still passing through the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known .
I &apos;m convinced of it and I suffer dou@@ bly and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I always mention , in which kind we have been physically and verb@@ al , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ se@@ ated femin@@ ists have been described in silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but all agree that women - all women - together should come together to make &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reach gender equality ( some ) women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about having an institu@@ alized form in addition to sexual violence that we have exposed black women to two times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or that black women and women also earn less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls with an immig@@ rant background often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spok@@ es and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence in the partnership , known as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one hand , I want all the women , all men , and all men every human rights have the same rights . on the other hand , I cannot take me as a black woman to consider the white woman who ref@@ uses to consider in@@ justice to the gender as well as to the skin color of one person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and I &apos;m not going to fight my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist sp@@ ying that has always denied me and countless other black women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained about 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a wife ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs , to push their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will no longer try to get the importance of the super@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for a better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ist femin@@ ism has been founded to abol@@ ish women of varying strength and desc@@ ended from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I prefer@@ re to release myself full and completely release of femin@@ ism that has been called for my dark skin and my status as a woman to life , instead of a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and give us into the spher@@ es that are created by us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson - We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana bl@@ ur@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves by ourselves , in which we can defend ourselves to our own way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be avoided .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ aries are immediately called separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , when they read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , as I have existed in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m because of my dark skin and due to my being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment where my life did not move , nor ignored , nor denied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to protect against the pollution : the mission of a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers from Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on major international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement this article is published again .
again , Nabil Mus@@ a traveled over the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the region Kurdistan in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who describes us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust trun@@ ks , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - who relies on it and works to protect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rivers , bro@@ ok@@ s and water trails in Iraq and support local communities in sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary filmm@@ aker and multimedia journalist , produced and published .

Paraguay : women and her more difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women const@@ itute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ n in the country and in the region to express its re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Christmas car@@ y@@ rou@@ gh@@ er ) , which reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who would have been for@@ ci@@ bly violent .
since the end of their relationship was time past and the police said , her statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was used for abuse of abuse , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez enh@@ ances nothing .
a few days later the second woman moved back to her ad .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are ad@@ judi@@ ce at all , they generally don &apos;t receive support from the State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of women who admit to be victims of violence at all in the prosec@@ utions authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
int@@ act and Statist@@ ical 2 In@@ visible mis@@ use and a legal system that nothing under n@@ imm@@ ac@@ 3 of Paraguay : good approach , defective implementation and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to find out how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , scientific research facility in the Centro de Document@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various data and reports , but not even to pri@@ z@@ end the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney At@@ tor@@ ney became an account of domestic violence due to domestic violence . 70 % of them went around violence against women .
86 % of ads on the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence against the peace dishes . there were also 86 % of all women &apos;s ads .
in the ads , 40 % of women were physically disabled , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these criminal off@@ ences are also indicated . &quot; on any woman who will be reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay with psychological abuse , 9 women will not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman being reimbur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women , who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the mass murder of Paraguay has no own criminal off@@ ences , the prosec@@ utions authorities cannot adequ@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered every year by their current or ex partners .
until August 2016 , journalists killed at least 12 cases of women &apos;s anti@@ cide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or ex partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible ab@@ uses and a legal system that does not under@@ take
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the solid friend of Carlos Vera , he in@@ sist@@ ed that she named him the names of all of her former friends .
at the beginning , she did not want to do that , but after that she was supposed to rep@@ ent forever .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . however , she carried the psych@@ ic violence against it - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ z@@ able :
I never thought that I would once be victims of abuse .
when I read it earlier , I thought that only women have happened to be sub@@ sum@@ ed , because they are dec@@ eit@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote articles on Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had ins@@ ulated .
many people answered her posts , including Carlos herself . he asked the rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen by Carlos so long and did not leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have had a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner failed her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network , which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk with others about their experiences , listen and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner also managed to convince her to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities were without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against its former partners who developed into an im@@ perme@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country , mainly for money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay : good base , lacking implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of mis@@ use is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill of legislation was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ quer@@ las ( # Princ@@ ely ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ influences ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law sees to expl@@ aining Fem@@ ale her to an independent criminal off@@ ence , and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbor@@ ing countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ative text was changed in a number of points , so that the de@@ pu@@ ties for the crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tion was not net , which are generally banned in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial bill of law en@@ vis@@ aged the majority of the bureau@@ cratic and economic ) proce@@ eding , which have to present the victims of violence , if they just want to receive advertis@@ ers and provide safe accommodation to the State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri , argu@@ ing that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide adequate financial resources :
in Paraguay , abuse as a proportion of human relationships shall be seen .
it must take place here , so that violence is no longer considered to be a little nor@@ th@@ ce .
those who are silent in view of these facts , make himself guilty and helps to run the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to refund so long ad@@ vert , until mist@@ ress does not apply more than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate was adopted , however , parts of the law had been changed . in this case , a passage that the partners had been cancelled in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes are falling apart .
the passage concerning the reconciliation was seen as the opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack its victims again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law , however , is considered a set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Christmas car@@ y@@ rou@@ gh@@ er ) , which reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
independent Media in Oman a year according to a newspaper still attacks attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been closed due to a decision to the Information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is published on the website of the banned paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the independent Arab authorities closed the independent Arab paper Az@@ am@@ n for their coverage on corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues in prison , where he served one year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i were also arrested and tried in court , but came later again .
in 1970 , Oman has ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , along with his role as the only s@@ ult@@ an , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Chief of Defence , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Central Bank .
the s@@ ult@@ ans of s@@ ult@@ ans is marked by the per@@ severe efforts of the security forces , in particular of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , including public freedom , including press freedom , tra@@ ders and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists to be in@@ ti@@ mi@@ dated and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
the authorities limit peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights system@@ atically and hin@@ dering citizens , including activists on the public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions online as offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( a absolute monarchy ) since its foundation in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , having been published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , it was corruption in the judi@@ cial system and the inclusion of high @-@ ranking civil servants in judi@@ cial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having pres@@ umed judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in a inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; edition of the Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bound hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the German editorial committee , was charged with the Special Operations and upon its arrival from the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS assumed the Deputy Director You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had been promoted as chief editor to Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris .
the paper has been closed for an in@@ defin@@ ite period after the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publishing and dis@@ semin@@ ation of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted , among others because of the public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shel@@ ving of the government &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public prosec@@ utor and s@@ lan@@ ders .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and money pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 Iranian Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) respectively . in addition , a one @-@ year professional ban has been imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to one year of prison and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after being used to use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information network to dis@@ semin@@ ate material that could be a danger for the public order &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 USD ) was scheduled for Al @-@ Abr@@ i and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Court said Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison .
on 10 April 2017 , Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released in Mas@@ cat on April 10th , 2017 . in prison , Al @-@ Ha@@ j is still imprisoned in prison , where he served his sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also lifted the resolution of the Ministry of Information , the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to return , the newspaper looks after attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Information Minister was issued an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signed an additional statement in which the closing of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was extended for three additional months and with what the Minister has made a further appeal against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists are not the only cases where Oman has been hurt in Oman at recent times .
for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ anic authorities :
1. You@@ sef al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ conditional release ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists may follow their job ;
3 . protect freedom of press in the country , and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have to prevent their right human rights work , and without fear of aband@@ on@@ ation measures , including directed sh@@ ic@@ ans .
the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and bor@@ dering the right to assemble peaceful , supported and provides protection for them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent need of the continent .
two reasons for the need to be performed on @-@ site medical research is there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global health , many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tuber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries in Africa far more serious implic@@ ations than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the discovery of these diseases are a big problem .
second , research that is carried out by African scientists themselves is helping to develop their own research capacity in Africa . greater role of science and technology can only be favorable for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Infection Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epidemic shown the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he made herself on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the bal@@ v@@ ical health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about confusion about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier is referred to as a private owner ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : right now is the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition I started a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion important for the important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will remain receiver , instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are quite well supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come hi@@ ther@@ to , for financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine job work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure doesn &apos;t conform to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous power supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students for all ages .
there are demand for special academic education , starting in every age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , investig@@ ate world trau@@ ma , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit .
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and complic@@ ates access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that the magazines can only be made available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is also limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the United States to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds producers change worldwide food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has bred a salad in the USA for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ sh@@ red@@ ding , the first plant , which has been grown and consumed by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only reduced by its own in@@ fest@@ ation and the question how many Sal@@ at@@ ums can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not further use them to bre@@ eders .
the patents are not only for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or seas@@ oned leaves .
over the past few years more such patents have been applied to increasingly more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ oons . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environmental protection and experts provide food security to the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition bred Mort@@ on is still a salad , but it &apos;s needed more , since its work is increasingly difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like in a river a b@@ oul@@ ders of rock , around which I have to drink . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a split with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go to too far too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand before court , no one can breed a new oint@@ ment , because all features are already patented . &quot; he says so well as possible , and try to breed those features which he wants .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ avo@@ red to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
it has also been connected to a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eders ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have cultivated and eaten red Roman ag@@ red@@ der in &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and ate . there is tested if plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather so , as if the movement originates from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the motion for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , the alternatives to copyright protected software is available .
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be permanently used for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , named Os@@ si , US bre@@ eders could also under@@ take that other animals can freely use the seed freely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business and buy it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders make it possible to cross their seed to breed it in order to avoid such pec@@ uli@@ arly beloved - two aspects that be prohibited by many plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
dis@@ mal prospects
Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg have control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed also plays a role in larger cont@@ ex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of pe@@ as@@ ants , control of food and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to explo@@ it the latter or being only little to uti@@ lize seed with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ izes that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genet@@ ically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not , from organic farming , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , we want to buy control of chemicals and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , we need to know more common , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , such as such as such vegetables are cultivated , is threatened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
food confi@@ d@@ ity without seed confi@@ d@@ ity is not possible . &quot;
members of Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit themselves to submit to others her seed . in contrast , you can proceed in contrast to the seed and plant features .

Os@@ si @-@ supporters ar@@ gue that the future of food supplies are vulner@@ able as the available gene pool on plant material due to the increasingly popular intellectual property on plant material , which is therefore reduced to restricted , un@@ ceas@@ ing .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . it found out that about one @-@ third of the cards are protected as a spiritual property , whereby it is not only use@@ able for plant bre@@ eders at all .
for other plants , there are estimates not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by susp@@ ects that mass@@ aging plants as wheat in more than larger style are as salad or carrots .
a question of vision
plants are so cultivated that they have targeted characteristics - of such that their taste or their colour improved to such as due to those in certain environments th@@ ri@@ ve and thre@@ ats , such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders dec@@ ayed by more and more patents . genetic vari@@ ability is more need@@ less than ever since the altered conditions are predic@@ table by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to ackno@@ wledge that genetic vari@@ ability is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company comp@@ resses the preservation of genetic variety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it claims that intellectual property will promote other bre@@ eders because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the Protection of Plant Vari@@ ations innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often , these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not in@@ hib@@ its innovations but promotes more material and know @-@ how to make public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees it &apos;s different : 20 years to wait until a patent strap is certainly no innovations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you are waiting for so long to breed to plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you should have lost the struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a common good and we should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeding has neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ric inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and most genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on is distur@@ bing the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not create the features itself .
the plants turn them out and as bre@@ eders , we don &apos;t have any idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant@@ ing bre@@ eders in the U.S. state of Oregon and Os@@ si &apos;s board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever nour@@ ishes a variety , he bred his own values in them . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures believed to grow gra@@ p@@ aci@@ de for their cultivation , cultivated in its varieties of agriculture .
my concept is cent@@ ered . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies - either reject them or they are holding it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case .
the independent plant breeding Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders become innovative by avo@@ iding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks as if I had to produce something new to produce new efforts , stronger than companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors have been selling my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent , one is really pretty easy for 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept is rapidly expanding around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; describes itself as professional organisation in the field of resources . for ob@@ taining the seed of traditional farm plants , the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organization Agre@@ ements is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license that ultimately has a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , so that the Os@@ si obligation can not simply be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive branch of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that the conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be pat@@ ern@@ able . thus , she talks about the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a statement is not yet a law ; now it is to governments of the Member States to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa , to learn some about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ ent@@ ment of seed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems that the organization currently build a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , for which scheduled next year &apos;s official start date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ence - a group of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - to make it possible to exchange and improve seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food@@ stuffs .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ized - a connection from Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially been accounted for where and as something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re now trying to make people clear that more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest targets of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still , the Egyptian authorities rec@@ alls its content on the Internet .
this time it made the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of June 5th the Egyptian government was locked up the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , where it critic@@ ized the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp@@ ly critic@@ ized the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information is bt@@ ful , despite this attack and the constitution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I to overcome all the technical possibilities to overcome the dist@@ ortion and not admit it . we hope to fulfill our task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities arrested more than two months ago , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ German edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and which from Qatar was a network of Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the Kol@@ um@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spread of col@@ oni@@ als and articles , which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the blog has been built to circum@@ vent the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian government &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; even the aim of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Blo@@ gger , the provider where also Zi@@ das blog is home , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he reported by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and recorded a video on how the police exerc@@ ised physical violence against two students .
his articles turn mainly in politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada went to the lock through the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs too block is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi , and if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is because of two reasons for me :
1 ) It succe@@ eds to con@@ vey the feeling of a siege to me ; an arrest , a su@@ cked murder , charging at the National Security Council , the lock Blogs and any other website , which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I was not writing in vain . in other words , my words have influence , though only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post of articles to avoid the c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , now after they have blocked him and they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mud go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , the Egyptian authorities opened 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this gave technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , e.g. Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE , also documented the blocking of vend@@ ors , possible by changing internet @-@ sur and private surfing , Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the locking of websites used V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content that might have access to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed that the census decisions have been concluded behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed with the court against this actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ orship and whom will it be attack@@ ing next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?

day for day newspapers in Brazil , with glo@@ omy lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous postcard designs .
some of the head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 year old was shot at school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ ie@@ ves sei@@ ze dru@@ g@@ store with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air@@ w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a cl@@ amped financial situation the force in 2017 reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these are everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
thus , published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16th August , this is not normal , &quot; in which it announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual dis@@ mis@@ breaking , etc . everything , however , is only happened in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call : that is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we can &apos;t close our eyes from the cru@@ el@@ ty to journalists .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision is not for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognise the war .
in the same video , a journalist &apos;s journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territ@@ ories , the crime organizations are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the Editorial the newspaper writes :
we realize that a mar@@ tial dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , gr@@ abs the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and her partner .
does the term &quot; War &quot; mean more than it protects ?
in an article on the News Portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed to describe the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this was in their opinion a just@@ ification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to make people responsible for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - like extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in staff , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ulate negle@@ ct of public service .
the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil lie to the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities lies in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we view the murder rates a state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the beginning this was actually a decline of violent deaths . since several years the U@@ PP has had to protect against several reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor municip@@ alities which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his fac@@ ebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio won &apos;t conform to the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio re@@ treats severe consequences for the human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls on the state to use means of ways and ways that are typical of a war . it belongs to the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is a sharp point in the landscape and an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wander@@ ed balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , in Damascus , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib , are currently one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly heavily affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations , and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of the UN and other human rights organisation , that the massacre was administered by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these areas controlled by re@@ bel controlled areas outside of Damascus , which led to people on local produced or caused by tun@@ nels and control points were mu@@ g@@ gled by tun@@ nels and control points .
through the years of block@@ age , traditional food as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics has taught the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with NGOs Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the usual food in Syria and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it very rare to be an attractive food squ@@ e@@ eze for many residents of the besie@@ ged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct project of the project , Abo Nabil , said in front of the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant it in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organis@@ ers , reports global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , this project has been known and expressed its relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to bring 125 families of knowledge to the plant@@ ing of fung@@ i , as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target of around € 12.@@ 700 , but will continue until Monday , 04 September 2017 , continue donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced greenhouse gases are used in order to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from native mushroom seeds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before she checked out their quality , whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom in a bowl . as they did , they used a larger pan . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Teacher for the Region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , they are distributed throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a bigger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ us for different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ care by eating food ( such as paper , tea , coffee pot , cardboard , etc ) for ob@@ taining new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to insp@@ ire people in crisis areas and we can help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a was carried out by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias Ab@@ ou Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ing on the 21st of October in many district cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were born in the north of Portugal .
two and two persons died , and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 to 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions that spread over the northern and central regions of the country and reached around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy happened where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European Fore@@ stry System , super@@ vised by satellite recordings , alone in Portugal alone , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - a surface of the area &apos;s size of Lisbon .
so you can make a better picture of Ernst &apos;s position : there is no fire in 4 bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .

the goal of protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ventive and fire fighting measures .
people wonder@@ ed why the civil protection wasn &apos;t able to stop the extent of tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al den@@ ounced of the Federation of Portugal , the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o declared :
in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did so . there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would happen again as in June , since the streets were very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits are inter@@ viewed with a high level of bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far @-@ reaching suggestion to the forest @-@ form , which the government had applied to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was ob@@ jected by the municip@@ alities , who saw the new rules as obst@@ acle for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law , allowing the applic@@ ant on means of self @-@ protection , that was an open back@@ door , so that everything was built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; João Sor@@ val won the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus has pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made from slightly flamm@@ able wood , like in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of that kind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these problems are added that the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents sought information , sought to contact members who was offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : she used his own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time across the location and spread of fires .
the project was formed in 2015 by the developers João P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was thus decisive that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users , who pursued the fires , didn &apos;t count the site more than half a million .

the path from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

during a night in the fall of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din Group who had conquered the short lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan was a country of terror and desp@@ air .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the Province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central gh@@ gh@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son a long time - maybe even more .
in dawn the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick it up , and bring him to the p@@ res .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly without protection .
the Taliban time for hat@@ red was getting closer and getting closer to Haz@@ ara .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked in a co@@ h@@ room for a few years . the work was difficult and made him sick .
then he took that which was left of its low pay , and went into Iran . once again he was in another country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ar , which were harder than he himself to make his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked also . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there , no heating . we hung a nylon in front of the open windows , so that we didn &apos;t care at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church which divided twice a day food to needy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers . however , it &apos;s true that the conditions to find asylum seek@@ ers in the country are disast@@ rous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is accommod@@ ated in over 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special centers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian Law asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned a reception centre if it officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still be drawn months after registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation either to rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
thus , there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ sh@@ ame@@ ful li@@ fel@@ ess help A@@ shar@@ af to strip themselves out of these conditions .
after spending several years in construction industry several years , A@@ shar@@ af stuck his entire savings in the founding of a host@@ els in Venice .
it was so well that he opened a second hostel for a while and a fast limb@@ us .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - one Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afghan women live in Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past few years some of Afghan companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea for his restaurant Orient Experience , where the cell@@ ars and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of its journey to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria cab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals do not extend far beyond the Italian food industry and retail , and aim to go back to the country that he had to leave for teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country , and I can &apos;t be happy if I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the country &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest provinces , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and dou@@ bts , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afghan people .

Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for as more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested at the same incident , four years in prison on a court date .

Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups are agree on account of weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attemp@@ ted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza was charged by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya in Cairo .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this term is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government has led a list of online services , which also allows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publication of the information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to take responsibility for removing contents and to force them on request for the loss of user data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
