<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I raised up with American movies, American authors have read and practiced American writers.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to inclined his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it, as if it is absolute truth, forget everything else, that is what I would like to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said:" "" "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always who you are, and it is easily gaining acceptance in a community of conviable people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very warm love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me how he turns with his narrow-minded personality.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his mind behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells us what he feels like a former colleague and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, latin, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his testimony and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won by the republican election, was the highest number one ever rated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that support this biglot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not have Trump and his voters do not get in harmony with people that I had to know during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, according to my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalization program, the people from all over the world, a deep believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps did not agree with the editor of "Cincinnati Inquirer," with the current publisher of the Cincinnati Inquirer. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball, and we spent a lot of hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity, which I lived with Sandy bahr, who fights their lives for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still suits her commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped to get used to the complexity of American life with patience and grace.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, were my mentors who helped me so much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those embodied by them inhibited my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump his way to nominate Republican Presidential data, they sent me a stop and the counterpart at its restricted vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps due to his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the conflict with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they divided either his racism and fanaticism, because they were prepared to overlook such things, almost the heart broke." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the ump-voters as a lawsiest.</seg>
<seg id="34">In order to arrange people, one of my friends, is exactly what led to us this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who deal with a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, of whom are most white, voted for Trump, because they would like to regain control over a country they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they would perhaps say that in this America they are still important?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, hardly anyone can forget the words of David Remnick, who is a cruel decision, who comes down with contempt upon those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this Whitelash" "" "Whitelash" "" "(note about the White against all other ethnicities" "" "; word game of white to the White and whiplash, which is as much as Schleuktrauma), as it has been the great Van Jones, has exactly what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you might have always like, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose the son of an Kenyan, whose story as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is huge part of" "" "white America" "" "of that promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, had my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd shouted.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latino have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who isn't like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Truman's country, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it is my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What about the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguaean city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played in both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very narrow connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from nearby beautiful creek ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years the La Banda de MÃºsica (music bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony of children and adults, which has an opportunity for overcoming poverty, with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is become the central interest for the parish of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English Newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth always offered a rare hopelance.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI comments:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run away back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their big passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timbrel, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village, which is located practically on the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital of Paraguay, on instruments made of recycled polyethylene:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments made up of local firm waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycler began under the baton of Favio ChÃ¡vez with that parts of waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, trombone, trumpet and trombone.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and by the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, reminds the beginning of:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them are not living with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an orchestra which plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary name" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "shows the musical performance on:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Each year, the world generates around one billion tonnes of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the wormons - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of garbage to music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can fight against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republished part occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for shared use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa then it was known that the ship had already practiced illegal fishing in liberic waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">"" "" "" "the East African countries were raised by this and little inclined to welcome the criminals of this kind to their coasts." ""</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused to sell one of its harbours and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly, the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, an executive employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the one time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch the fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia, due to pillaging the country's stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminals and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries that illegally stop fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries, who had expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "with this we have eight countries that work and work together. they exchange information and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing." "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegal fishing. this project provides support for FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is under definition irregulate: what is caught is hidden, so because of it is extremely difficult to locate. so the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberately misregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem harm can have a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing became obstructed by bureaucratic hurdle, and with the information from different countries, these actions happen in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange and discuss lists of existing licenses for example, news on suspicious activity or details that one had noticed during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also pursues very attentive to the activities of ships, when they move on the open seas, with satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark those who fishing ships in forbidden areas - such as suspicious routes - such that a ship charges his caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies may show whether the infected ships have a fishing licence, where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal canisters.</seg>
<seg id="116">"" "" "" "countries that are against illegal fishing, can accept the acceptance of such ships in their harbours. what means that the ships can not sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the prime minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owners, which means that illegal fishing catch is financially free anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an adviser company supported by the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, who lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen, who invading eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which attracts commercial fishing companies from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices such actions, like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying identikasification, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserve.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an uncomplete control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship was illegal fishing and a country could then say 'You must not run away my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me '." "" "and just this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front works so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 studies of extensive ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks, which had counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. there were ships that used several fraudulent identities and found their winged ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with Interpol, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that helps FISH-i to more suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed further, helps to hide from illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst with Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishing data and provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ortalized by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that links different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal acts with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team African nations can actually take influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened its presence with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and display the capacity of each individual traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of it, who is doing what," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project running in which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but also detecting them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which were previously committed without license and had to reckon with consequences, now they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries involved in FISH-i have a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since then fishing boats may buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 found out, inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose deployment is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice this success." "" "the effect is so strong that we have now also copying other countries," "" "Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa annually, several hundred million dollars will disappear through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there are six countries together in 2015, on the so-called West Africa Task Force." "" "it is now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "security is to be even more such initiatives in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's recent member of Somalia were able to report his first big triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship travelling under false flag. not only the ship was on board without a license and towed towed nets that are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also reserved in forbidden waters which were reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the take of rules against Greko 1 they set out a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing." "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time, proof that such special, collaborative working methods to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="198">The interview was translated in English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced from his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult, Quijano now said in the context of the great La Perla Ribera creek in the province of CÃ³rdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of bearing the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he retained the family secrets for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I believed that was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a salmagent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you can't notice that it is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not yet know that my father was a thief, folks, and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinian military dictatorship of 1974 till 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander in the prison group 141 until 1978.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had witnessed the extent of the atrocities that he had witnessed as a boy, and he spoke before a German court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To overend, you need two important abilities: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transmit it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in case of native language. in general, belief that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - mother tongue.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native tongue should translate into French for example from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as mother tongue that could make translations into English. this may be attributed to lack of understanding, quotations, or the relatively low number of native speakers that can be Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who have no foreign employees themselves, make translations to make their company intern. then, the Japanese employees, whose English knowledge, will be the best to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The words and enigmatic phrases that arise through machine translations, that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the weird English formations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints, which often uses T-shirts or pockets, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be even acceptable or at least harmless. but of large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The City of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source of translations for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="469">At some evenings the owner of Alvarenga forced to stand alongside him and to read Editorial from opposition newspapers like "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media over the dictator's regime.</seg>

<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, a Criminita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I was unable to invite anyone home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="544">"" "in early March 2017," "" "Kahoku Shimpo, who achieved progress in the last six years, had been achieved to rebuild the lives of those who had been hit by the" "" "triple catastrophe" "" "by March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima happened the disaster." ""</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shino-Zeitung, located in Sendai, is located in Miyagi prefecture. the Miyagi prefecture was in Japan's north-east, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had vanished entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">On the Fukushima prefecture, the prefecture of Fukushima happened, for that reason, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report by Kahoku Shimpo shows that progress has been reached from local perspective for six years, to rebuild the life of the local districts.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the data subject.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo paper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned substitute houses (kigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwata were finished.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures were recorded by Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned surrounds were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima won the closing light with 70 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the disaster, it is still trying to deal with accommodation (kigmatic), kasetsu juutaku), even six years after the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Shelter.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwata in such Behausungen.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima happened in 2011, whereas Miyagi had become more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated families who were evacuated after the disaster, were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwata the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected fectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shvacco paper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the disaster, opened their doors down to December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures are much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishing harbors in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, just 30 percent of fishing harbors have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and atomic accident, withdrew large areas in the three prefectures of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural field in Iwate and less than 50 percent of agricultural field in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear bomb, only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farmlands of Fukushima, lying in the" "" "nuclear" "" "nuclear zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism has largely recovering itself, but Fukushima still remains downcast away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same state as before the disaster. Fukushima, however, only 75 percent can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo paper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it is difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to identify a whole picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacuated population. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how you find feeling against the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of this article, the Kahoku Shimpo paper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents, taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that still not enough in terms of catastrophes was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reinforced its attention to the situation of the evacuated Fukushima situation.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima still had to experience the devastating earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also the witness of the worst, catastrophic accident, atomic accident, Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160 000 thousand evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, settled in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fukushima outside of its home-prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes, most of the evacuated events, who still have to return in Behelongings, are more than 50 years old. they must compete in proper accommodation projects, because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is a project that will be part of the Olympic Games, which will be part of the Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso closed almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as a el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, no matter of that there is no notable sugardener on-site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It's two years ago when the activities were lame in the sugar cane mill factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the rise, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost gradually and after its plants, until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories, which are even grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who stands at 4: 00 every day, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not bolted his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the east of the sugar cane factories, which after long inactive time are in operation because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers that MaÃ±alich would have received the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiencies and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">By 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the land a few decades ago, but the bad yields were not any more new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane feats off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway track of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The diminution of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mill factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar-plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of an unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos will stay in pounds, according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural Perspectives," by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will go down with security in history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">During the years the lactation of a total of 98 sugar cane-factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word that he is most repeating," "" "deception." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of the first year, the first letters started.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially included documents which would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed from the addressing and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulla Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve every sympathy.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was transferred and the letters were becoming more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero had been responsible for the disused factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still-grown sugarbeet factories."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in his will at the halt of the factory, whose construction he helped.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the Commune of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich learned that many things are changing, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane mill closed, or better said when they started to drive them off, they also listened to asphalt road, disadvantaged also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the area, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look up other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production is not even for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began working.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths from the First Nations communities across Canada do deal with topics that are important for them. they do them with hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of N'we Jinan-Tour we have been bringing up workshop mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio, video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and together with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop Group The Northstars worked together.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop is thus increasing the young participants in discussions" "" "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable" "" "or what always gets to the sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kithkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "" "" Highway of tears, "" "" on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered. "" "</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate how important of the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people have not always rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the refrain will be sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters responded to a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group that gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the verse is at your disposal, as well as a translation into English, which translates into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like that one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on the earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day where you will take our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will be levelled one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I would not like to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also lead our youth up</seg>
<seg id="712">So you can do it, whereto she has determined the creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To illustrate potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are located close to the menu shokuhin sanpuru (kigmatic), "Plastic models of dishes") of each food, served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see this plastic dishes, and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district, there are a large number of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes made by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga about 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they are no more notably. however, a new trend is transformed into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the Blogitinii published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sandy puru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now on special sale: new plastic ribbons decorated with plastic ribbons like it can be shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, coolbox magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some shoots for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is increasingly more elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular travel bowl of seafood) was transformed into a cell support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also have this part in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here's an apple, which detects your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">A few cell support and cell phone designer allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon have been cheated, a popular Topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "Wow, cool, now I can cheated my mobile phone with salmon." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example colleagues or family members unpleasant to surprise.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile support has the form of melodious ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handrails of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # Solid State.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with shokuhin sandy puru.</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two powerful topics or frames (frames) that take these posts. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of major discussions regarding the silence of Christians through Muslims or - in the defence of Muslims, the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhist.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how a African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion do not want to understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth considering how images should be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens when readers can no longer give faith these images longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are many people who have unintended use to trend the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests that the mood of the mis- and false information, that actual atrocities are untrue and tasted the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images appears like a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, worry that violent images and spectators dessizing the ability to empathy empathy (for example, this study which sought to act as violent media on it, others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is much to discuss violent concepts in the news media, fact is that they are essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologise experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you'll have to thoroughly examine the struggle against "" "" Fake News "" "," in which a picture suggests something, which is actually solved from the context or completely abusive way. "" "</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now in spite of a language barrier to somebody else?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative of Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the compilation of stories in their original language is the possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the Improvable Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to maintain and diviser the diversity of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages will not be shared to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"" "" "" "the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we accept cities which don't forget diverity - safe spaces in which citizens must not forget to belong to." ""</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often are linked to understand," "" "these events instead hear" "" "listening to appreciate, link, link." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers appear their story first in their own language and translate it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional storyteller, their surrender and their representation is that the audience agree on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call Laughter and Emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Faso, who is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou, also takes the opportunity to explain the stormy customs of tales of tales.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak from the bunny and the cavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after he explained the meaning of his navel, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how is that to speak to an audience, which does not understand your language?" "" "he shares his sense of incompetence:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were completely with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all, who are inspired by the project, can engage with TLS in order to organise their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a retest of public debts of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars on April 3, 2017, several religious and civil organizations involved in a mass rally; the march started at the purepikan Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and licensed here, contains a number of articles that deal with free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a homage to Bassel and its work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>

<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the directory of the Adra prison, where he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about its current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own fate, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the Webdeveloper of Open Source and Digital Activity has been detained by Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, was transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police bases on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court of his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi said that it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people who settled himself as an insider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His dwelling and state remain unknown but still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, plays a decisive role in supporting the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technical biologist and momentary of the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">There was perhaps no one of Basel's cultural prototypes as the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civil activities and merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and persist influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that for ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything to it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip-train in the digital archeology and conservation has created a time captive, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically the bassel has not yet been able to shut up this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life in order to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overcome when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well, to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him. he has taught other incarcerated, reading English, to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my gate to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also taught other intact as they use computers, at least in theory without it actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a prosablecloth, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She muggled the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabian horse into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption in which a government member returned to the employment of state apparatus in which the corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other accused, due to tresppersion of 54 million Metacal (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mosambik airports, which Chief Cambaza, between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his return to the company, which happened on April 19, too.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement of the Attorney General's Attorney General, there would be no obstacle reason for Cambaza to revoke his old post, since the company had not performed any disciplinary trial after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants don't miss the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution responsible for public transparency, sentenced in an interview with the German wave the decision of the company to re-establish the director:</seg>

<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">However, since he is incompetent, he has unanimously approved to reintegrate into the company which he helped harm.</seg>

<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals and serve to serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as a trade itself is getting tired of money and the state itself is getting tired of that man and finally condemned to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this guy was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief was in prison:</seg>

<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or in Latin America (in Burmese) as part of an initiative to cross the widespread problem of hassortation in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical Nationalist movements has given the word an extremely variable connotations.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra Nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the efforts to fight Hassus in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself is not calling out automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or in doubt for his use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burial words with fundamental meanings that have the same sequence as' calar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese even 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Sphinbse), 'Kalar Oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknit Aung Kaung Myat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was erased today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1304">Zin Win Heching is the opinion that she will reduce hassus radikaler nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analysis must be more analytical, before it proceeds to the suspicion in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">The word is automatically filtering.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should be done is to analyze the mail carefully and check it by checking the existing words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (switch busses).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these tricky nationalists spreading a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion is a powerful signal to all send, the efficiency of this strategy may not take long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have proved that the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or alternative writing of the common word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... as I was aware of this new directive by Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>

<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism through their platform, but it doesn't work like that.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words can be censored only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament in Parliament voted unanimously a law that has to offer this practice, so that the age-able age is now 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the spouse, there were some members of Hindu religionism at the practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country assembled, that the state should not interfere with the state, because it is not the maturity of the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractor of the UN child's prevention, the minors as well as defined by people under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15, in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical Federal Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married among 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were trying to abolish laws on children's before, followed at the foot, and rejoiced with great support. no doubt, they helped to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no concern to tell the critics of the children before they should take care of their own business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This sort of religious opposition was an intricate thing for tensions in this actually uncomplicated cause, and at some point, doubts about whether the opposition would agree with the bill of law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But early in 2017, the bill of law was decided against the children's before - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who abstained, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where an easy majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a Status update to Facebook, which wrote Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of law against the children's before was launched in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one was by the only one.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Once it has been decided in the Senate, the draft will now become the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a minister of Ministers in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">There is too much time and unnecessary talk about that the core of the business has veiled, but know what? the child's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth nearly every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel's opinion, it was definitely long enough to take off the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was happy that the day was finally arrived:</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folks Mutota, who belong to Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society, which said openly about it, how important is the law of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The Trinidad and Tobago age-able age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religion of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The proposal to change the spouse was approved today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputy in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>

<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law said it was absolutely right when Maharaj was working against the law, most social media users wished for a debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of keeping the discussion in general, in a way that can only address the state in our bedroom, that it may be misused to say that they may be misused by major, hard-sworn men that are opposed to them compared to the advantage, would you be prepared to carry out the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, if it comes to a judicial procedure against the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children's laws are legal or still the norm, even though it exists.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English language course was presented on 18 January 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over one month the Turkey has been locked the popular and at the crowdsourcing principle based Encyclopaedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day out day is more clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series watches against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques used are used to use canned tools for blocked web sites (a recent article from the New York Times agrees that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not drop in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been postponed from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, you will find regular blocking of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrors pages (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform found all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-Peer-network (i.e. calculator calculator), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is not callable despite the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (via the lock of Wikipedia), we put all of these snapshots from Wikipedia to IPFS Platform. thus, the possibility of reading the content to decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the www.wikipedia.org website.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also showed that this stage was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni by Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklope.org, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when protected in the country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices, as well as members of Mozilla at the Panigrahi's Open Contest "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">It is accessing a different URL that's not the original. that is what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server continues on request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see contents from Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around him, never satisfied. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivates him to carry him a camera with itself, trying to try the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring himself to the international stage in Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town directly next to the Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that directs attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home, when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my Father that would be a leopard on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river, where the leopard was, and I immediately started to crackle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">"" "" "" "Sagar aims to obtain global recognition of the authorities in order to obtain global recognition for Nepalese nature and would like to realize that wild animals are not so furious than they look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he was in the face of the tiger with face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot disturb from the opinion of the sheep anymore!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I also went home because of darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the busiks appeared. he immediately calls us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar is placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days long, and usually lived in a tent to take pictures at the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger for six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1470">An revised version was re-published as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women concerned with greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronouns or" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they should respect the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should respect the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudodish and spurred by her family and the village community after having named a married relatives.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Tradition is also not common to name their wives by name, it is also common among men. however, they have far fewer approaches to fear, if any of them should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them healthcare, and housewives, a unique club, were thus quickly becoming the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone to discuss and discuss the enemy of the Patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community video Volunteers and is set up for the mining of Patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera, such as children's pagan up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and they simultaneously made ambassuring of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that the Rohini showed in their discussion round, did not mention of women who do not call their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this topic, because she wanted to open a conversation about the patriarchate with an issue that women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To express the names of their husbands, a Brauch, who has pleaded not guilty of all, and have never put into question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">These traditions testifies that a woman wants her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't hold this is considered deceitfully, as woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thoughts about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never mentioned her husband, have never been called by name, try at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband are silent for a long time, after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should name him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in Baggage, Rohini started its first discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "Patriarchate" "" "never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to put the discussion with a practice.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everybody," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want," "" "they mean that they may not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas in Maharashtra on the Breasts of a century-old tradition, who married women to their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise just before him; a others decided to release the whole stubborn frustration against him and his family by cursed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In addition, even in adrenaline exchange with an ancient Brit, the women decided that they would actually try home to call their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"" "the husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into the head," "" "his wife could not stop his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in law she stared, she was afraid, and said that it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">An husband's husband was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the carcinct red point on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the chin-red dot if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I heard that to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped but they think they are now in a better position to be able to carry him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion group is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we are doing an excursion at every discussion group." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I do not want to worry about the women who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated her own birthdays in her life with cakes; they danced and sang about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I also talked about some things, for example as our identities to our husbands, have never been said to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say things noisy, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris for their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted a saline cta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own closets, the morals connected with the Saris and much more, muginged Rohini (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">"" "" "" "next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry Jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1531">"" "" "" "on the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion group has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are getting slow into the roles:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have just made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tested it a few times, but then we listened to the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry a Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in a discussion group know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like going through more freedom of movement or their own closets - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they realize they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I'm also there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club is each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it's not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club following home and other people, what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention to international community awareness after his lawyer was announced in late June, that he was hospitalized for liver cancers in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was condemned to eleven years in prison because of "Subversion" (nationality), after having responded to the design of the Charter of 08, a manifesto that demands democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and a speaker told, he considered it as" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, free to allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of Paares in Beijing, others have completely widened the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has merged several reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met by the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister in Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius's liberation.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway got into force after the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian Government approved that it ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations were finally continued until December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to absorb the salmon and exports to China, since the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the message that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee presented his hope for a conditional release to expression and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his arrest, he was unable to meet his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament approved a decision in which China was prompted to free his house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The chief diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, called China also for the release Lius, as she hasted in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We also expect China to raise all constraint of Mr Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A speaker from the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the message agency AFP was released on June 27, that the message was to release Chinese authorities but not only Liu free but also his wife Ms. Liu Xia free from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US Embassy withdrew a furious answer from China after itself, with the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs," "" "No Land has the right to be able to implement and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom like travel security and access to medical care of its choice, to which they have claims according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Mercury and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision to push for the Chinese government to push for Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing news agency that China had great concerns on whether the vortex around Liu was overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On June 28, calling the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China invited Professor to provide adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to restrain himself from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP earlier that Lius Ms., Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it does not allow Liu to speak with anyone outside, including its lawyers, talking and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "in Canada, China urges China to safeguard its international human rights committed, including freedom of expression, and for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>

<seg id="1671">Though the news conference of France would already say that the French government Liu would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was announced that France will eventually receive no further information if France will eventually take him up.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question seems stupid, since Singapore is recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to Justice Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister knew that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one asked questions whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, where most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to turn the logic in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and ascending to create this valuable land, we can say that we don't have any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape before the answer, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my land, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons presented by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'ordinary countries', in view of it, he seemed undemocratic undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old lyre of the authoritarian leaders will be appearing, leaving deserted logic, because it suits her power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">At the end of the last week of Shanmugam they were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judit, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions, he cloaked with non-answer rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam pointing out his opinion, as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city is, so to which country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"" "" "" "I would be very grateful if our" "" "K Shanmugam" "" "would take up the effort to clear this point unless it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1709">By discussing his comment on the blog, he suggests that the whole of the conference should begin to understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the heading.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said, Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so much easier, even if we are happy and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He spent Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">As he said, Singapore was not a country, "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, as leader of a Herangrowing generation, making such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "I am about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said it is very busy..." ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, what I expected - unless I agree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review discovers the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanmugam "gutted a mistake" or was it a miserable man?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what land does the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the governmental treaty, the testimonies of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1749">Americans, however,....</seg>
<seg id="1750">It was also when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1771">Being harmless, means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to deserve.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continue to buy is their decision expensive U-boats, although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how persons are thrown into a black delivery van, before they bring them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war company recovers only very slowly in East-Asia Minor, especially in the Tkuarchal district.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abchasian war officially ended, but his scars are still very visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The deserted villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show marked pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the coal-pool of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, sealing Asia, Georgios and Armenians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most Russians and destruction are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">These settlements are also called ghost cities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people still lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the county was 16,000 people after having barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approx. 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, bridged walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the phone user in Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it has signalled the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "web cleaning").</seg>

<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockage of the pornographic web site, from online fraud, Trojans and phishing pages to make users alert on how much time they spend online in order to recontrol the home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, with the filters for minors, should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBT + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib takes over the most of its time inside; sometimes he will kill himself to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine withdrawn lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house which has heard them since 1967; the year, when Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs's family came to flee from their village in Palestine, where she had lived as felahyees (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For more than six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist who interpretended the conservative majority and interacts their final opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"" "" "" "with his music, who deals often with issues such as Oriental peace, racism and the situation of the entire Arab world. all these topics can not only be found in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that from Damascus all to Sanaa in Yemen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking, and can cooperate according to their own statement with people who have suffered from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not give it openly, he won a special inclination against American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his studio at his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as "Palestinian anti-flection of the second generation - so he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own living conditions," "" "emphasizes Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think I'm a man," "" "while he poured out the nest in water in two cups, it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from dawn to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness of breaking down ancient traditions. on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a scorching hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the mhole talk with a warm coffee and the waxion of Kent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when one casts a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Thus, it simply avoids basic things to do - as in public during Ramadan water - to not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections, supporting the Muslim Brotherhood - argued the Muslim branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier, Hamed Sinno, contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert tabula.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former press officer of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world is hazardous activism that asks the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila rated the Jordanian people as a "progressive supporters of human rights," which remains committed to an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably be not simply flattered rhetoric, but in fact a clear crystalline reality is clearly conflicting, which occurs in Hdaibs's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib's traditional spiritual norms came to body by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have preventive sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously wooded unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years, Jordan has increased the number of 'honoring' honoring - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human rights Watch according to Human Rights Watch, however, reached its peak in 2016; however, Jordan is still controversial that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support the women who were victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a law for interruptions in 1954, women who are exposed to danger of domestic violence," "" "may indefinitely be detained in prison," "" "and for her release is often a longlary bureaucratic expense and the guarantee of the family requires nothing to happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for that, also not revere to topics, which in its country long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib argued that his work is politically, but dreaming that he's his music, which is full of explicit announcements on sexuality, freedom and expression, not separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was tried by politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "lies the focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are political in the core, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse appears quite often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "during the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words," "" "that can get what you want" "" "- be faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly anybody in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were sharply censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya to note later that his comments were torn out from the context, twisted and his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a reworked version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires the Arab LGBT + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance towards homosexuals did not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century who still stayed in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who should work later once on behalf of the Caliph, was able to write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, didn't do anything with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the Haschemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attack on freedom of expression and that progressive votes will be silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service took several former government members and members of the teaching association, with the reasoning, they had focused on comments in social media, related to the deeply rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, hdaibs's concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and take. Jordan is now denied a gig, but the way of progress - so it looks great, demand and innate changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, is also from an Arab world without interventions.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he is not only dreaming of taking his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will help with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, streams, and artificial way organized democracies. at least he is hoping it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to rest and therefore also resist the resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2152">One thought that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually taken over in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the drums and dancing are covered over a thousand years, in order to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to conquer the knee.</seg>

<seg id="2183">Why do we just write love letters to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more importantly, people who feel ejected to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question was the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the head of Bogotart and Cristian Palacios from the head and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la ReaaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), who encouraged young people to write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was setting up an historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the Guerilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces in Colombia), which forms the point of point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the signing of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "there is still a long way ahead of Colombia, until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakov, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric, and around the clock contributed their weapons to the life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, again, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, they have to record in their ranks and support them when building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Colombia would close together and assist in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla, to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerratic fighter - who then should be handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, held in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2198">"" "so the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC bands, who now have to build their place in society and build a new life." "" "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse from a history of peace to a joint history of peace." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>

<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC run the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the whole of the peace process. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can contribute to a society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles" "", "one of them said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2283">The requested to send me back to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked them, "Some said to me," I must prove it, by running up without through the streets; others said that I didn't change my sex in the official television that everything was just bad-speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>

<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, a car was placed under the window with a darkened window discs and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I was clear that there was something lazy.</seg>

<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I had arrived.</seg>

<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about sexual intercourse, this is a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional kcasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very much I wish I can not overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really give me toil, like the person to look out of their past - so remember my male shape.</seg>

<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed in?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who joined the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan had no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he didn't shut up a new wave.</seg>

<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says that there would be just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to make the Kadyrows dish.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that they can represent later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies under TV and claim they could have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappearing, but purposed to radicalizing themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who imprisoned one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new about them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, who was involved in himself as these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they have not been presented as a bandits until now there were yet no reports. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why wouldn't you have this man allowed to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappies of people who have heard of so-called "non-traditional" orientation, were already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always bore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already familiar with Grosny in 2003, when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia was originally intend to bring us back to" "" "civilization" "" "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were cloned; I had dyed lashes, bore pipes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The sharia's security ministry has never bent me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people as met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechnyan language there is a turning point: as Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte doesn't say about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children, if they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just got their eyes closed from you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>

<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on the morality of morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us, but primarily on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who suffered and laughed at once and laughed at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you think now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still working as activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicated with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teacreffs, gatherings, I begining them to the hospital and help them to get food-cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have to pay a penny.</seg>

<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: it is alickers.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>

<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go to the mosque and fasten and live together with men during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think in transiveness of men who love men, and they believe that they are his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a key.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not feel ashamed of my body.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had one child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahraz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and was ashamed of his own helplessness to stop the inability for his family, such as Ahmadazi-human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video released on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was taken into the Talega hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region, where most of those in Iran live in the Arab Ahmadazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, making it difficult to deny the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arab Ahraz was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy increased the power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable utility areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population suffers only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and discharge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denies the Arabwazi Arabs systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These damme have led only to worsen the devastation in the region by drought them to destroy local farming and palm trees and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab-Hawaiian youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist, resident in London, told Global Voices, that the current situation, a mixture of poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "said to a" high rise "of self-murder among young Ahmad men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse and the reason for this is a combination of a high number of civilians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the production process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionary and institutions are preferred to set Arab workers, the local Arabian Ahmadazi of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">"" "" "" "this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to forge their living being outside of their home ancestry." ""</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their pros and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahmadazi and are not tolerated as Arabic name at work cannot be tolerated, because the speech of Arabic language or wearing arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahmadazi have to endure, strike rights activists alert before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be waiting, whether the world is awakening and taking it from it.</seg>

"" "there are various data and reports, but not even to prizend the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," "" "she explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, Attorney's Attorney Attorney became an account of domestic violence due to domestic violence. 70% of them went around violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads on the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence against the peace dishes. there were also 86% of all women's ads.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women were physically disabled, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these criminal offences are also indicated. "on any woman who will be reimbursed in Paraguay with psychological abuse, 9 women will not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on every woman being reimbursed for physical abuse, two women, who do not do this," "" "declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Because the mass murder of Paraguay has no own criminal offences, the prosecutions authorities cannot adequately documented, as many women are murdered every year by their current or ex partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists killed at least 12 cases of women's anticide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or ex partners.</seg>

<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she did not want to do that, but after that she was supposed to repent forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos. however, she carried the psychic violence against it - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read it earlier, I thought that only women have happened to be subsumed, because they are deceited by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, they wrote articles on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had insulated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered her posts, including Carlos herself. he asked the rhetoric whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen by Carlos so long and did not leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have had a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that her former partner failed her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network, which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk with others about their experiences, listen and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has bred a salad in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as outshredding, the first plant, which has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only reduced by its own infestation and the question how many Salatums can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not further use them to breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or seasoned leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more such patents have been applied to increasingly more plants such as cereal or cartoons. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental protection and experts provide food security to the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition bred Morton is still a salad, but it's needed more, since its work is increasingly difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavored to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also been connected to a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeders).</seg>

<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be permanently used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, named Ossi, US breeders could also undertake that other animals can freely use the seed freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"" "this does not mean that they do not continue to do business and buy it." "" "open source" "" "breeders make it possible to cross their seed to breed it in order to avoid such peculiarly beloved - two aspects that be prohibited by many plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dismal prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg have control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed also plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control of food and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter or being only little to utilize seed with natural resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supplies are vulnerable as the available gene pool on plant material due to the increasingly popular intellectual property on plant material, which is therefore reduced to restricted, unceasing.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about one-third of the cards are protected as a spiritual property, whereby it is not only useable for plant breeders at all.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are estimates not yet, but experts such as Luby suspects that massaging plants as wheat in more than larger style are as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of vision</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so cultivated that they have targeted characteristics - of such that their taste or their colour improved to such as due to those in certain environments thrive and threats, such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders decayed by more and more patents. genetic variability is more needless than ever since the altered conditions are predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledge that genetic variability is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company compresses the preservation of genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it claims that intellectual property will promote other breeders because" "" "patents and the Protection of Plant Variations innovations." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is up." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibits innovations but promotes more material and know-how to make public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it's different: 20 years to wait until a patent strap is certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"" "" "" "and if you are waiting for so long to breed to plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you should have lost the struggle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a common good and we should continue to remain:" "" "independent plant breeding has neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetric incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and most genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is disturbing the concept of patented plant features: "we do not create the features itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants turn them out and as breeders, we don't have any idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, planting breeders in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi's board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever nourishes a variety, he bred his own values in them."</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures believed to grow grapacide for their cultivation, cultivated in its varieties of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is centered. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies - either reject them or they are holding it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders become innovative by avoiding plant patrons: "it looks as if I had to produce something new to produce new efforts, stronger than companies.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I constantly need new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors have been selling my varieties in a few years ago," "" "he says." "" "with a patent, one is really pretty easy for 20 years." ""</seg>

<seg id="2721">Still, the Egyptian authorities recalls its content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it made the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of June 5th the Egyptian government was locked up the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, where it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step sharply criticized the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">"" "" "" "the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information is btful, despite this attack and the constitution" "" "to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been so important as now. ANHRI have never been so important as now. ANHRI have never been so important as now. ANHRI to overcome all the technical possibilities to overcome the distortion and not admit it. we hope to fulfill our task." ""</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities arrested more than two months ago, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-German edition of the Huffington Post, and which from Qatar was a network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he reported by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and recorded a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles turn mainly in politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada went to the lock through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs too block is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi, and if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is because of two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It succeeds to convey the feeling of a siege to me; an arrest, a sucked murder, charging at the National Security Council, the lock Blogs and any other website, which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I was not writing in vain. in other words, my words have influence, though only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post of articles to avoid the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, now after they have blocked him and they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mud go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), the Egyptian authorities opened 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this gave technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), e.g. Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE, also documented the blocking of vendors, possible by changing internet-sur and private surfing, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the locking of websites used VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content that might have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally worsened that the census decisions have been concluded behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed with the court against this actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and whom will it be attacking next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The population quarrel.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day newspapers in Brazil, with gloomy lines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city of the country and home of numerous postcard designs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of the headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "14 year old was shot at school" "" "Every second day a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "" "thieves seize drugstore with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and airwafee to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a clamped financial situation the force in 2017 reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">Thus, published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on 16th August, this is not normal, "in which it announced, a new section called" War in Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper as:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual dismisbreaking, etc. everything, however, is only happened in Rio. (...) This is our way to call: that is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we can't close our eyes from the cruelty to journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, that this decision is not for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist's journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories, the crime organizations are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We realize that a martial discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used, grabs the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and her partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "War" mean more than it protects?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the News Portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argued to describe the violence as a "war." this was in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to make people responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - like extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in staff, education and a historical and complaculate neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">The state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2782">At the beginning this was actually a decline of violent deaths. since several years the UPP has had to protect against several reports about chicans and repressions against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio won't conform to the criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime.</seg>

<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockage, traditional food as meat has become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics has taught the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own fungi as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with NGOs Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the usual food in Syria and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine. however, it makes it very rare to be an attractive food squeeze for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban time for hatred was getting closer and getting closer to Hazara.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a cohroom for a few years. the work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took that which was left of its low pay, and went into Iran. once again he was in another country together with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar, which were harder than he himself to make his living.</seg>
