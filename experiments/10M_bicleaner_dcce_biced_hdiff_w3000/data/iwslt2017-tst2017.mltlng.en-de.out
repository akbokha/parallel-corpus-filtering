that is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he sing@@ ul@@ arly published that the NSA has illeg@@ ally heard teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but there is another chapter , which should leave a lasting impression .
in this article he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US secret operation , where the CIA was literally handed over to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , you can read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like ?
the US Government .
for nearly 10 years the government has raised against R@@ isen and asked him to call its alleged sources .
in this train , he has become a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and repor@@ ter journalists .
according to the First Constitu@@ tional , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ fu , they might award them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government arrived at R@@ isen , he did something that many bold repor@@ ters did before him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , for years it would be vital for their case , the demands of the government were dropped on R@@ isen .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and springs can hide themselves less .
rather than fail and R@@ isen , you could get his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without mis@@ understanding , wor@@ r@@ ying his t@@ elecommunic@@ ations ,
just like his e @-@ mail , financial and bank information , its l@@ ending information , and even travel information with the list of his flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and risk of suspected source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the justice condemned him more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government gets too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of making a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower one repor@@ ter .
so , we put the media working in the game , which should be protected by the first constitu@@ tion@@ aries , because the government has more possibilities to create them all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but equally , as technology of government permits to handle the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and indeed they can contact them from the moment , in which they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness .
today there is communication software that has not been written when R@@ isen has written his book , and it is much safer than ordinary e @-@ mails or telephone call .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous , which was developed by us today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload your documents or send your information , just like in any ordinary form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only has access to the relevant message agency .
so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information you would like , would not be available by default .
Secure@@ Drop is but only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments over all over the world develop new spy technologies that all end@@ anger us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to ensure that not only technology companies such as Edward Snow@@ den have the opportunity to kill mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t want to report about ab@@ u@@ ity at the supplies of soldiers and reported by over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm for a cont@@ amin@@ ant water of Flin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ck of history was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; was disclos@@ ed that the rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous money la@@ men have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to be a declaration . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the lawyers in Panama &apos;s local law firm .
the release of these documents gives a glimp@@ se into the hidden world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ ul Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , how it works .
this has already led to first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
there are also reports that there has been a ally of the brutal Syrian Dic@@ t@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad station@@ aries in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars on Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who are waiting for the next release and un@@ disclos@@ ed documents .
now this sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
it seems weeping , from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that tackle us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens , and not all of their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets .
and that affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by some few , to hide their wealth and veil@@ ed -- something that we will discuss for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always point to myself like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society , what matters is .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no famous Americans that previously appeared in these revel@@ ations , sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but through the principle , after this tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ ul Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US states you need less information to give less information to found a company as to get a library card .
this type of transparency in the USA allowed it to prevent school children from education to school children .
it does not allow operators to am@@ end particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so , we sent an investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself an African minister , who wanted to bring the suspected money to the US to buy a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all of you were looking forward to an Adv@@ oc@@ ate of our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ dict@@ ations . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to this system . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider that not as individual cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer looking forward to our covering investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not about a single leading politicians , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , taxes , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to overcome this , we must change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound all very tr@@ us@@ sin@@ king , as if we could not do anything , as if nothing ever had changed , as if it will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I am quite sure that some has begun to change .
in the last few years we have seen predi@@ ctions to more transparency , aff@@ ecting the owners of companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the EU records the central regist@@ ers at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties agree to a bill in both parliamentary groups , but this is not the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations , this huge view into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people , getting angry if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spot@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need senior managers in the economy , which stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and get in use by laws , using this type of in@@ transparency .
together , we can finally stop the in@@ transparency , which is now allowed to end this type of tax ev@@ isions , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
that &apos;s the story as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after my design study had completed , I made a block sale .
one type in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says , he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I will not be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
that &apos;s a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; U@@ H , how please ? &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what was I broken ?
a wild@@ ly sleeping in my living room .
what if he is mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got from the bed , at ti@@ p@@ toe on the door , and my sleeping door shut .
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
the work of art , which he purchased from me today hang@@ s in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
sleeping on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took air mattress .
let us take a jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ a , my ro@@ om@@ mates draws and the rent is raised .
I learned that there was a design meeting in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it easier to turn into fun .
I wrote my best friend and my ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I wonder@@ ed how we could earn something for a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created &quot; air mattress &amp; breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 bu@@ cks at the air mattress on wood floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red all the city with them . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I start to start .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent ?
the things came into rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ gers , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept .
so we presented our investors : &quot; we want to create a website that publicly posts pictures of their private premises , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms , their doors are closed when visiting .
they can then invite wild people over the Internet to stay overnight .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but she did not .
nobody , who is still at consol@@ ation , would invest in a business who allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we all learned to have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , one gets on the things that can be done well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than appearance and feel -- it is the total experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create imm@@ oral trust among people who had never met .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , what degrees will we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up , if you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone your left seat .
this quiet sw@@ elling of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when the first time opened the door .
for the only thing , which is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home .
visitors can &apos;t only read your SMS , you will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most are the responsibility .
you will also feel most guests if they stay elsewhere .
for this reason our company can exist .
only so , who actually has Al Go@@ res mobile phone now ?
could you tell Twitter to call for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor should have imag@@ ined with his name , when he tells , where does he come from , like his dog or his children ?
imagine , you had 150 Agen@@ cies that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to em@@ it your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ thought feedback system strength@@ ens the trust decis@@ iv@@ ely .
in the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard to vote for people , negative convic@@ tions .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were off their courses , before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied , as probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are at the age and residence .
surprisingly , we trust people most re@@ sem@@ bling us most .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
that is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person -- in our case by convic@@ tions .
if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation view common@@ alities .
the right design can therefore help us overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we knew that trust is dependent on how much you get from itself .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if one tells too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer .
one tells a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; -- the request is rather not accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le Art &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in your home ! I &apos;m doing with my family vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design , creating this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which issues you should write something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with which we didn &apos;t expect , the large amount of people who were more than ready to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
fir@@ stly : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need which had not been covered before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course , there are times , if not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have illeg@@ ally celebrated parties or rav@@ aged flats .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile .
I was in front of the front , when trust has been broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it &apos;s hur@@ ting when I think of it .
dis@@ appointment , which you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately only a fra@@ ction of 123 million had only a fra@@ ction of the 123 million .
for men confi@@ ded to each other .
if confidence works , mar@@ vel@@ ous works can arise .
one of our guests did a holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host@@ ess drove him to the hospital .
he even don@@ ates blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , which tend to be car@@ cin@@ ated due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real protection rules that rescue a life , although they don &apos;t really know it correctly .
they drive a car in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
they leave to stay one even longer , excluding the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of part with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s about an economic trading here .
but it &apos;s just called the &quot; rental industry &quot; but it will not just be justified .
share Economy disc@@ usses a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself open , and this changes everything .
when people are traveling today , it is fast to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would be if traveling a rich buffet would be from local impressions ?
what if in every place you &apos;re visiting , a group there would be waiting to take a thoroughly filling and one of the stro@@ kes district , of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could cook a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , dwell@@ ings are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments with inter@@ locking devices ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities were to accept the thoughts from common ones ?
I place cities , which allow us company and relationships instead of sol@@ itude and de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were now offered residents , students who were looking for a stay ,
were taught by people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ators were launched ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries are being hosted by a stranger or even host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us .
we have not invented the wheel .
and there was also hospitality before .
there were similar sites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the correct design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think that amaz@@ ingly ,
absolutely overwhelming .
I have to think about it whenever a red Maz@@ da is over .
we know , of course , that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this huge impact , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you see me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ in@@ wash under@@ went , a terrorist man ?
or simply a delay in the airport security at the airport .
this is true indeed .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media show@@ cases that look like me .
a study showed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans mean , most would not know any Muslims .
presumably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslims , it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I was intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual mus@@ li@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because she baby , I was not born so well .
I decided to do it .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and on the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt like a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents only passive .
I ended up with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought I thought , was desper@@ ate , and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and slow dedication , deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
sometimes the beauty of rhythm leads me to tears .
I know myself . I feel that God knows me .
ever did you ever feel that someone receives you fully under@@ stands , and yet somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later , I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked out on the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ an . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jum@@ ped from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into dig@@ nation .
why should one do such a thing ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam , ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... the Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; m@@ bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u turned me the actions of others by a citizen in a susp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle East in the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as we were silent -- when we were silent -- so deep it went to my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslim .
we moved to our apartment this night in a new town in which it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the National Islamic organizations , who said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ d , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims gather to prayer .
and again , the war@@ nings came : &quot; not at this first Friday , the mosque might be one goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feelings were under@@ stand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were held to Muslims , dra@@ gged and struck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there really was Bran@@ dan@@ es on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because people who had attacked this country , attacked our country .
I have caught up the anger of people to terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to explain .
I have nothing to ask , I love questions .
it is the acc@@ us@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , we can actually hear people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go it ? &quot;
some people want Muslims fle@@ ans and close mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church like a tumor in the United States .
it is just the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor you only holds under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are like all other Americans , not tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are the inventor and teachers , sth@@ al and Olymp@@ ion@@ ics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America be safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque brings people to consider people more toler@@ ant , and greater civil involvement .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alizing in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , one has found that it begins online . as a first , the person from her community can make a bra@@ in@@ wash that the person believes the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everybody who abh@@ ors her behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , then we must stop people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group establ@@ ishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as Muslim , as a Muslim , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination , if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology details on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you throw a look at them , they don &apos;t drive on what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that you can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding im@@ am told me a very amazing story :
a girl came to him , because she is the curtain of the IS .
I was positively surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The problem was just the opposite . everybody had spoken to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of in@@ justice in the world , she would only bring them into trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inspired by nothing and something that would have given its anger , it was a main goal for the instr@@ ument@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who spoke a solution .
this im@@ am turned the connection to God and her congregation .
rather than to blame her anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept to join the IS .
this was a glimp@@ se of how the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our thoughts ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows that when it was reported to test persons in which neg@@ atively across Muslims , they voted earlier military attacks on Muslim countries and circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims , from 2001 to 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the fore@@ court of Iraq @-@ war and during two constitu@@ ents .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to the Muslim terror which I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but toxic air of fear weak@@ ens us all .
in assignment of collective debts , it is not only about to explain to itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental department , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said ,
&quot; when is such a young man from my bridge ? &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had visited her in the afternoon , as with a execution , after he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we to the mosque , or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we talked about it and for us it was not a slight decision , because America would like to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely prac@@ tise our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we opted for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we were silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
when I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , stopped me .
the hall was completely filled .
then , the Im@@ am made an announcement , and called our guests welcome , for half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ ei@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , and non @-@ believers , who were not to attack us , but for us .
in this moment , I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion to panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to be sure ?
or will you join them that mean : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you might say that you might say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thought with deep thinking , is an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you are not deceived . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually am as it is allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one sees to Muslims all over the world , and I did those with the greatest ever @-@ made study to Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I do not have an exception in any respect .
if people appear as an exception to rule , often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ers , it is about to become a billions of dollars .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . it is possible in research institutions around the world .
before air @-@ packages arrive in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built live an six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting connecting flights you reach high speed and acceleration in the lowest room .
you can also build self @-@ loaded structures .
they have learned to carry bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight in autonomous flight .
for a system autonomous works , it must know collective en@@ vy where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the fast development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , comp@@ ut@@ ations on board determine what the machine should do .
external commands are available at the highest stack e. g. &quot; Start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter ,
a flying device , which tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ring , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a fli@@ p@@ side .
a restri@@ ction of tail@@ ors is that they react sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight equipment doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions that are to the core of the cause . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known about machines with thousands of moving parts that meet you to viol@@ ate you .
in decades ago , pilots could fly remote control units that had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ ster .
recently , we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est control device . it was invented recently .
it has only one mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ sters , no other actu@@ ators or Control@@ lers , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the inner life very much , so that it can fly stable and move in space .
yet it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to put it to fly , I have to throw it right correctly .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to look properly if I see all , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in genital sin@@ ess , this machine is here , the buses with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
thus he receives the great ability ,
move in the space to move in any direction , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
some is conc@@ ei@@ vable in models , the rest is being learned directly by flying .
let us see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin prop@@ eller @-@ aircraft engines .
this turns in clock@@ wise direction
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you accum@@ ulate them , they be@@ have like high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong - a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration explo@@ res synthetic shame .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we used commerci@@ ally Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where the room she is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine would like to be a plane screen on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the reward is in the development and the production act .
it serves as a memory , like wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe , and that it allows creative , smart floors to shape them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential , is the t@@ ittle on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cling in a very far @-@ distant galaxy in a very far @-@ away galaxy in a tenth of three black holes in pure energy .
this short moment they lit up bright as all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the well known Universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
finally we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we sort the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago there was a close @-@ in life on Earth .
since then , Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stands for us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group decided to build a group of particularly brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ on@@ ating black holes .
most people kept them crazy .
but enough people recognised them as a crazy gen@@ ius , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation contributed their ideas .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ allic gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ ob@@ servatory .
in the following time , the precision of Lig@@ o increased considerably , what improved performance enorm@@ ously improved .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 Lig@@ o was rest@@ art@@ ed for a last test run to clari@@ fy some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the start of the detector , smo@@ ked gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of both col@@ li@@ bel@@ ating black holes through the ground .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hughes : just two moments in my life are emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my to@@ ken father .
in essence , it was the fruits of my life .
all of what I had been working for what I had been working is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , the theoretical physics of black holes and their through ob@@ servatory like Lig@@ o meas@@ ur@@ able signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a force in the structure of space and time .
while passing the shaft , the space and its whole content are stretched in one direction and per@@ ges into the other .
to illustr@@ ate cur@@ acy in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity often a truly al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretch and du@@ sty , stretch and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ culous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched to the waves and ended up . the strain of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . God explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should just be measured less than an exchange of the radius of a nuclear strike . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt after the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties of such det@@ ectors are enormous .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are fin@@ alists and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott would like to asser@@ t lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what it means .
visible light has a wavelength , much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite practical . for this way , you can just@@ ify a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you .
for tones it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much :
guide your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics , such as pitch and volume , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice is talking about . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob &quot; by appointment .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t produce any simple images of objects in All .
but by making changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least Lig@@ o measured the measured frequencies in audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave pattern to sound , we can literally hear the All literally .
the gravity is to listen , so much about the coll@@ ision of two black holes can tell us what my colleague Scott looks very long .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , flow@@ pen easy : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circular p@@ aves with an additional key change . that sounds like that are called : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement of movement , embos@@ sed into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o &apos;s following : &#91; Sur@@ render of sound &#93; No one knows what he has to hear , this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times of sun mass , which rotate in about as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what it means .
two black holes , the dense body in an all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic . fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
many in All , we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ elles stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about this .
the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see you , because this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vitation waves are penet@@ rating iron , as it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is covered by its own light .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and probably most important : I am optimistic that we never saw in all things we have never seen , and of whom we have never seen . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things like in the first attempt we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that make black holes , such as Lig@@ o they are observed , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o enables us to experience a completely different angle of events in All , on the creation of stars and ultimately , how we went out of this may@@ hem .
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servatory -- a brand new generation of ob@@ servatory on earth and all .
what could be better than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I tried to experiment a experiment .
for a year I would say Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of which I feared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter whether it was nervous that brought me in un@@ pleasant situations I forced me to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be live on TV live ?
no , but yes !
do I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just to do that in front of I was afraid , my fear was removed .
my fear to keep spe@@ ech@@ es , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly type@@ . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the little ones , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if it were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; squ@@ e@@ ats , I need milk for my s@@ quad@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me whether I could play with her , when I was just in the jump . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new way of life in my family . from then on , I s@@ wore to myself , always with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I stri@@ ve very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a stunning side effect : only recently I understood the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play my career with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think of things I aw@@ aken for life .
dream job .
no , no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing television , in great style .
in this TV @-@ season I am able to carry out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every programme offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a TV can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days with four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three ship@@ ments , which simultaneously production are four , 16 episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows were run on Thursday afternoon .
around the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 this 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , so still live . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans of camp@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not im@@ press you .
I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tell you all of you who work so hard if you are now taking a company , a land or a classroom , take a serious business or a household , so that I &apos;m not only talking about the computer , so that I say , I do not understand that it is not dreams during a dream job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s all a job , everything works , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I en@@ gros@@ sed in the work , there is no different feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
it &apos;s when I step@@ ped up troops when painting on a canvas .
so as to give a high sound , creating a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work it .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and matern@@ al , cru@@ el@@ ly and sen@@ sible . and the best thing is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when the work runs well .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s ceas@@ es like a busy street , I could go on for ever .
many people take the sum@@ s when I tell them the sum@@ s that I write about writing that writing me joy .
do not understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work with television production , when I began to work and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sw@@ um is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t be any different to size .
the feeling not to be different compared to size , no matter what price .
that is what you call the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is called Genius .
maybe it &apos;s your ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not for the failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want it into question .
to make one thing clear : the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more things , the more things at the same time , the more things at the same time , the more things more I write , the more things I write , the more expectations it exists .
the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burnt out .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are used to the truth , that her mom@@ my is a single job title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mom is not going to be there but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; I would like to go to Sh@@ onda Bay . &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are baby carriers .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t loved my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , no repent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ e , does not give up , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an indication Titan ,
everything was gray , I just didn &apos;t have fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and sum@@ s of the sum@@ s .
so , what do you do when you doing , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ading ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gras@@ shop@@ l yourself , stupid writer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what you are doing , you are working to be a ban@@ ker , a ban@@ ker that knows how the sum@@ s knows , and know how the sum@@ s know , when the sum@@ s only knew when the sum@@ s stops , who is one ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart ceas@@ es , I can survive in the silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; cellar represents me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will say no , when two things are aware of :
fir@@ stly , I have to say Yes to everything and secon@@ dly , they didn &apos;t called me . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; prize . &quot;
when did it happen ?
I miss it when I gro@@ unding Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything will change in my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
we play and their sisters stum@@ ble , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ etry . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and the absence of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except for getting up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed on .
I am silent .
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they do not exist anymore .
all that exists are st@@ icky tape and hum@@ id k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , juni@@ per pins and the song in which it goes over@@ s , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; is letting go .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and a burst of energy comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel when I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work environment , the titanium box , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who are you when I tell you who I am when I describe my brain by using broad@@ casts and TV lessons and how my brain is , then I forgot what the real Sum@@ ma is .
the sum@@ s is no force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real Sum@@ ma depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the power that comes from the life of life .
the real Sum@@ ma is self @-@ awareness and peace .
real Sum@@ ma igno@@ res the pressure of history that are to experience , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real Sum@@ ma is simple and original .
the true Sum@@ ma is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it just is love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am making it a permanent rule , so that I can release myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of all debts .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play is not very close to me , how do you work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer more workplace than at home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , as what a human being works rather than to be a house ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of it .
we ras@@ en around in the garden , ahead and back , round and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we are pu@@ zz@@ ing soap bubbles .
I feel mostly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always attack@@ ing my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my kids show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing ?
you can do it too ! then they always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you stay for nai@@ vely for a day@@ dream .
you probably have right , but you can do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most about 15 minutes , until they think they want something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ran@@ fer or K@@ eks replaces me .
and my teenage daughter , all 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , but no need for it .
everybody can get 15 minutes on the play , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no storage .
the day is short : dinner , tired of the kids .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my welfare , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s , a place for his peace of peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; playing &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect therein . I &apos;ll fail and hope . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; just for everything I was given up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training when I wanted to out@@ pace myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not get 15 minutes away ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s returned in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return then I &apos;m not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opening up and I find myself back into my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . I ow@@ e it to new ideas . I use it in full trains and I love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no longer .
bubbles and st@@ icky finger , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the Sum@@ ma of Life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful .
it is a cra@@ b that I am a Titan bin . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem plays .
I said Yes to less work and play more .
nevertheless , I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country I create , the marathon , which I create , the troops , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the real Sum@@ ma : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , rep@@ airing , naked , and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think of things I aw@@ aken for life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this jobs ,
because a dream job should be dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be less and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am a Neuro@@ surgical .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious strike or car accident .
for us Neuro@@ surgeon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very small ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent and serious disability .
that is probably the reason why I became functional Neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; surely , they have one of the most famous , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep @-@ stimulation condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it im@@ plan@@ ates an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function has improved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , which suffered from fier@@ ce trem@@ bling and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , is not ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream functional Neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help yourself .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was instru@@ cted colon@@ atri@@ cian and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I used patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that brain trau@@ mat@@ a brain sw@@ elled the brain and increases the skull @-@ pressure .
to save life , one must decrease the skull pressure .
for this one has to remove a part of brain mass .
rather than throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by doing that ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is no easy task .
to grow cells from one tissue , comparable to small children who can be taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to flour@@ ish .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many trials , it managed to Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a family culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
you may still know of the bi@@ ologic learning that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it &apos;s surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OP .
we did another fascinating observation of observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells Hot Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they comprise 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ rum @-@ cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why stay they supposed to receive us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of brain , as we find it in higher concentrations of brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear , however , -- from these cells , we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ language area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did by Jean @-@ François
and they will then mark colour to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we plan@@ ked them at the disposal of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- auto transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we state these cells in normal brain tissue not plan@@ ing ? and what will happen if we are unable to plan the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely removed after a few weeks , they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , so they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and not plan@@ ed exactly the same cells , and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were not plan@@ ed .
the evidence that they show is these tiny points . these are the cells that we are coloured in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkey with a manual skill task .
they had to pick up food pellets of a tray .
they did very well .
when they had achieved a stable skill level , we injured the c@@ ort@@ ex in motor c@@ ort@@ ex .
then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , it recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are par@@ aly@@ sed and then try to relax with the help of plastic bra@@ ins . they recover a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand you see the monkeys that fet@@ ched spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
now see when we were not plan@@ ed : the same monkey , two months after the irrit@@ ation plant@@ ation .
I can tell you , we were also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found much more about this cells .
we can freezing and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic models , for example with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate her in humans .
I really hope to show you soon , how human brain can give you the means of healing himself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that even now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can need this . &quot;
I am definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are , before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . going out of these great results you have to complete about two kilograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very delicate etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried permission to start clinical trials . if you continue in the future , how many years will it take until someone can come into hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it has a long time to choose the patient , to test the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you must first re@@ prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and it &apos;s sure of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a course of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider her as a imm@@ utable theory .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big suc@@ cum@@ mer in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is actually hit by us , in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as a finance minister in the euro@@ zone , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the savings , which were realized in Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my humble friends who would repeat me if it would change anything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point , I want to present an economic model for a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev believes the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a truly and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for without democracy , our societies are disp@@ ens@@ ed with our future , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies .
on w@@ ast@@ age , I want to point to an interesting contra@@ diction that is actually threatened by our econom@@ ies .
I call it the &quot; twin summit par@@ adox . &quot;
one summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg who raises its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Scho@@ den@@ berg ,
but only a few recogni@@ zes his dy@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of un@@ explo@@ ited money , which , however , is too anxi@@ ous to invest there , where it would be productive and bring into all the things that could produce and produce all things that are urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the US , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,4 tr@@ illion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on .
3.4 billion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with 5,@@ 1 tr@@ illion U.S. dollars , who were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing was doing besides the stock markets and the real estate prices .
so , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds within the U.S. , Japan and Europe are unemployed , those who would not invest in a low demand that would not invest , in which they would not invest , that his son might kill him if he will grow .
un@@ inten@@ tionally the circumstances suggest that est@@ rel kills him .
this is my hat@@ red with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; its extremely f@@ ath@@ etic art . All the un@@ productive capital should be used to further improve human talent and finance especially all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
I believe . but before we proceed : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the corporate form , in which the free and the arms control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy completed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to decrease the importance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these out@@ lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the making of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they gave the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but essential and crucial to them , they grant them the right to political participation with equal voice weigh@@ ting in question of the heads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held long --
like a candle , which lights very bright , it is also fast burned .
however , today , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have its roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ical Democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthening the poor , our liberal democracy on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a charter of ruling .
for the liberal democracy came up only when a complete separation of politics and the economy is possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics during the economy -- so the world of corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ cr@@ ative free zone became .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , the separation of politics and the economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable struggle between the two instead of the economy gradually w@@ anders the policy .
do you wonder why the politicians are no more like that ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in mind that today one can be in the government and still not in power because the power of politics are w@@ aved into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my hat@@ red with capitalism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s like a flock of prey that is so sustainable the animals , from which it feeds on the end , that it is so hungry for the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
similarly , it is similar to the economy that is so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized , that it grows by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corpor@@ ations grow , the ine@@ quality is growing , the overall demand and the general staff of corpor@@ ations are anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful of capitalism sells the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the t@@ wins , and the greater the waste of human labour power and welfare of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ build the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is by the way , no new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the theory of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only acquire a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working arms !
capitalism is doing it by expanding low @-@ glo@@ bin workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as econom@@ ies and politics are separated , the automation makes the twin summit higher , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is coming soon , as soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re@@ design the economy and politics to re@@ design the economy and politics to demo@@ cr@@ ise the re@@ united area , otherwise we may end the re @-@ united hyper@@ car that will show the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the question is , whether capitalism has created the technical achievements that he has brought forth , will survive --
&quot; &quot; &quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism are re@@ sem@@ bled through a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is re@@ sembles that of the company in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve people , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long discussions to the sense of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe we might be optimistic .
so what did it look like , what could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ opia ?
in the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market where you work and in which your capital is working with you from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all in@@ comes from capital and rede@@ em and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not belong in it , but the company does not hear there . there &apos;s no exchange between capital and work , no big fan between investment and sphere , and ultimately no emp@@ oral t@@ wins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the field of global political economy , please introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of entire human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and every government is paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade bank of the respective country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that these funds are investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment is rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that , at that time , the technical means did not implement it .
today , we , especially in front of the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ate , where they preferred privileged people , and Marx@@ ist because they buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we be t@@ apped into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we will make ourselves political .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ ist Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I said just is relevant , Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... do we do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand what Larry sum@@ mers are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next one , as we currently experience it , it is not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not wir@@ l , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it &apos;s a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who said it . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday with the supp@@ er of the Red@@ ner you have clearly said what you are going from the view of the west to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy in politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- in the field of economy -- a completely demo@@ cr@@ ative zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a certain way , if I may say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China re@@ sembles the England of the 19th century today .
because -- you remember -- we tend to associate liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , histor@@ ically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ alism , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
it was especially scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed in China , re@@ sembles the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to second .
now China must present what the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I think that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how to look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view , and very disappo@@ inting as we had the opportunity to start with the euro@@ zone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and to den@@ ying that there went a massive shi@@ fting line by the euro zone , and continues to keep a massive rise in the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity to relate to the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that den@@ ying this den@@ ial -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone did not continue to den@@ ial the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to receive a economic system which is not vi@@ able to maintain by political will and author@@ itar@@ ism in life , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destruc@@ tive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change their setup .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who claims in office after 6 months , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , he claimed no mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest on pages of the funding , to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring our government to fall , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the dist@@ or@@ ations coming through the euro@@ zone .
they refused to admit that they have been a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program for 5 years .
we lost one @-@ third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of funding , who has imposed this policy on us , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , they still seem to be pretty much per European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone fell from somebody who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone did not survive .
for if they did not survive , the released tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have consequences for Europe alone , but for the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we embar@@ k on the way to a post @-@ modern 1930 , it will appear as well as for the future of Europeans like non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re in this point wrong .
Yan@@ is , thank you for T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 average minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Movies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content that will produce Amazon .
of course , it is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he must find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this curve .
this curve is the application division of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review .
if your show is rated at nine and above , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that have ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after having looked for a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should be enough to tell you what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not have to fall into the left side of the curve , because I believe you already need special intelligence in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he turns out more thoughts about the mean excursion , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just insp@@ ire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something that &apos;s why Roy wants to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where she can watch for free .
and if Amazon returns in vain things , you get there , right ?
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
however , they do not know they will be seen at the watch of this shows .
you will be watched by Roy and his team that brings everything .
you know when you start the show when you pick p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts will be ski@@ pped or looks again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon ought to make Sit@@ com for four rep@@ ubli@@ can US trans@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; alpha House , &quot; but it appears that not many of them may remember this show because they were not so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company , another manager has pl@@ az@@ ed a top show by analy@@ zing data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always looking for this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but it &apos;s something different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have looked at the Net@@ fli@@ x audience &apos;s existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that shows her shows , their shows , which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went on a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four transm@@ is@@ ers , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very competent , data reversible companies .
they combine these many data together , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic needs to work somehow that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision .
there is back 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimized it by very powerful computer .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis is not working so , this is somewhat sc@@ ary because we live in a time , in which we are more and more to statistics , to make serious decisions , far beyond TV .
does anybody know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in jail .
if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asking for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is done or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . instead of deci@@ ding if a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results produced . this is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data being also diversi@@ fied companies are also false .
yes , even Google does mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is possible to predi@@ ct analysis of the flu , a terrible way , predic@@ ting data analysis of Google &apos;s research .
it worked wonderfully and was a big news event . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the release in the &quot; Nature &quot; magazine .
even the data versi@@ fying firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- in the workplace , in case of dispute , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer@@ ized genet@@ ics -- one area , with which some very wise people un@@ imagin@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years , I recognized some samples from the difference between successful choices based on data and not successful choices . this pattern should be extended .
you need to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things :
first , you split this problem in its own parts so you can analyse the individual parts ; as second , you put the individual parts again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : to dis@@ assemble and assemble .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to res@@ end the parts once again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we have it all : our brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is something that the brain is good , parts and pieces come together , even if the information is incomplete , a good decision , especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience , but they have otherwise not been able to collect all these pieces , and make it a show like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is not in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions first , when they compet@@ ed for TV ideas , then as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision , because they were always able to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions with a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you only have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ll get it later with a technical demo .
I have so far made some decisions in my life so I should listen to the ball in hind@@ sight .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more delicate , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball boun@@ ce and cl@@ ü@@ ger , and ultimately it lies on us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encour@@ aging message that in spite of the great amount of data still pays to make decisions to be an expert in that which you do , and risks to enter .
because at the end , there are not the data , but the risks associated with which you end up at the right side of the curve .
thank you nice .
