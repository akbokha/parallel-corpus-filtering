<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he singularly published that the NSA has illegally heard telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter, which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this article he describes a catastrophic US secret operation, where the CIA was literally handed over to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government has raised against Risen and asked him to call its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he has become a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn Whistleblower and reporter journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mufu, they might award them.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many bold reporters did before him," "" "he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, for years it would be vital for their case, the demands of the government were dropped on Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring, reporters and springs can hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than fail and Risen, you could get his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without misunderstanding, worrying his telecommunications,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail, financial and bank information, its lending information, and even travel information with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risk of suspected source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead the justice condemned him more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government gets too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of making a whistleblower one reporter.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the media working in the game, which should be protected by the first constitutionaries, because the government has more possibilities to create them all.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "but equally, as technology of government permits to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they can contact them from the moment, in which they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not been written when Risen has written his book, and it is much safer than ordinary e-mails or telephone call.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet-famous, which was developed by us today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload your documents or send your information, just like in any ordinary form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only has access to the relevant message agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information you would like, would not be available by default.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments over all over the world develop new spy technologies that all endanger us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is to ensure that not only technology companies such as Edward Snowden have the opportunity to kill misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "he doesn't want to report about abuity at the supplies of soldiers and reported by overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm for a contaminant water of Flint." "" "or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leck of history was released.] [the "Panama Papers" was disclosed that the rich and powerful] [enormous money lamen have been hidden in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to be a declaration.] This week we were asked by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the lawyers in Panama's local law firm.</seg>
<seg id="43">The release of these documents gives a glimpse into the hidden world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mosul Fonseca and say:" "" "OK, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that there has been a ally of the brutal Syrian Dictator Bashar al-Assad stationaries in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars on Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people and others who are waiting for the next release and undisclosed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John-Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping, from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that tackle us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens, and not all of their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "in all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used by some few, to hide their wealth and veiled -- something that we will discuss for ten years." ""</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how this tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always point to myself like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no famous Americans that previously appeared in these revelations, scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after this tax havens function, Mosul Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states you need less information to give less information to found a company as to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the USA allowed it to prevent school children from education to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It does not allow operators to amend particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So, we sent an investigator in the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself an African minister, who wanted to bring the suspected money to the US to buy a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all of you were looking forward to an Advocate of our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all predictations. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over to this system. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider that not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer looking forward to our covering investigators." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leading politicians, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, taxes, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound all very trussinking, as if we could not do anything, as if nothing ever had changed, as if it will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I am quite sure that some has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen predictions to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">"" "" "" "the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland." ""</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU records the central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties agree to a bill in both parliamentary groups, but this is not the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama's revelations, this huge view into the world of tax havens, is used to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people, getting angry if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spotlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need senior managers in the economy, which stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognize the problem and get in use by laws, using this type of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally stop the intransparency, which is now allowed to end this type of tax evisions, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">That's the story as I was almost abducted and in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after my design study had completed, I made a block sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">One type in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a roadtrip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says, he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I will not be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That's a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "UH, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what was I broken?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildly sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got from the bed, at tiptoe on the door, and my sleeping door shut.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art, which he purchased from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Sleeping on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost plea, my roommates draws and the rent is raised.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design meeting in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it easier to turn into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and my roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I wondered how we could earn something for a designer bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created "air mattress & breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 bucks at the air mattress on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese ham-Omelet tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured all the city with them. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I start to start.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blechargers, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented our investors: "we want to create a website that publicly posts pictures of their private premises, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms, their doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">They can then invite wild people over the Internet to stay overnight.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still at consolation, would invest in a business who allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned to have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one gets on the things that can be done well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than appearance and feel -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immoral trust among people who had never met.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, what degrees will we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet swelling of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when the first time opened the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing, which is more personal than your mobile phone, is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can't only read your SMS, you will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">You will also feel most guests if they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">For this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell Twitter to call for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor should have imagined with his name, when he tells, where does he come from, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you had 150 Agencies that all say: "he can really hold very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to emit your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-thought feedback system strengthens the trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard to vote for people, negative convictions.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were off their courses, before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied, as probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are at the age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Surprisingly, we trust people most resembling us most.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">That is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person -- in our case by convictions.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation view commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can therefore help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we knew that trust is dependent on how much you get from itself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells too little, like "Hi!," you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One tells a lot, as for example: "I have problems with my mother," -- the request is rather not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "Tolle Art" "" "in your home! I'm doing with my family vacation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design, creating this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which issues you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we didn't expect, the large amount of people who were more than ready to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times, if not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have illegally celebrated parties or ravaged flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was in front of the front, when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it's hurting when I think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">Disappointment, which you hear in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately only a fraction of 123 million had only a fraction of the 123 million.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men confided to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence works, marvelous works can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests did a holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hostess drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donates blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, which tend to be carcinated due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protection rules that rescue a life, although they don't really know it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive a car in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave to stay one even longer, excluding the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about an economic trading here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it's just called the "rental industry" but it will not just be justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy discusses a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself open, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When people are traveling today, it is fast to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be if traveling a rich buffet would be from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in every place you're visiting, a group there would be waiting to take a thoroughly filling and one of the strokes district, of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, dwellings are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments with interlocking devices?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities were to accept the thoughts from common ones?</seg>
<seg id="238">I place cities, which allow us company and relationships instead of solitude and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents, students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught by people whose children were moved out. incubators were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in Share Economy. over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries are being hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">And there was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the correct design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Absolutely overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it whenever a red Mazda is over.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this huge impact, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brainwash underwent, a terrorist man?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is true indeed.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media showcases that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study showed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mean, most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslims, it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I was introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">"" "" "" "and I am a practicing, spiritual musliin." ""</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because she baby, I was not born so well.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you oppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, and on the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old felt like a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents only passive.</seg>
<seg id="280">I ended up with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought I thought, was desperate, and believed in the end.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confidence and slow dedication, deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">Sometimes the beauty of rhythm leads me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Ever did you ever feel that someone receives you fully understands, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later, I married and started like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked out on the screen and saw the word "Eilan."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into dignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam,... "... in the name of Islam..."... the Jihad... "..." mbombed Mecca! "</seg>

<seg id="301">"" "" "" "it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu turned me the actions of others by a citizen in a suspect." ""</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle East in the USA to move into a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we were silent -- when we were silent -- so deep it went to my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment this night in a new town in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims fleans and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my church like a tumor in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is just the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor you only holds under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, not tumour in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are the inventor and teachers, sthal and Olympionics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque brings people to consider people more tolerant, and greater civil involvement.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalizing in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, one has found that it begins online. as a first, the person from her community can make a brainwash that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everybody who abhors her behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, then we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim, as a Muslim, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination, if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>

<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me a very amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she is the curtain of the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was positively surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"" "he said," "" "The problem was just the opposite. everybody had spoken to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, she would only bring them into trouble." ""</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have given its anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam turned the connection to God and her congregation.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than to blame her anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was a glimpse of how the Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when it was reported to test persons in which negatively across Muslims, they voted earlier military attacks on Muslim countries and circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims, from 2001 to 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the forecourt of Iraq-war and during two constituents.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to the Muslim terror which I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it may actually be a tool for manipulating the public to the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but toxic air of fear weakens us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In assignment of collective debts, it is not only about to explain to itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generous man, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said,</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man from my bridge?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after visiting Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had visited her in the afternoon, as with a execution, after he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>

<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we were silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for Basters, it is about to become a billions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-packages arrive in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the FRAC Centre in France has built live an six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting connecting flights you reach high speed and acceleration in the lowest room.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-loaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry burdens, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">For a system autonomous works, it must know collective envy where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the fast development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, computations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available at the highest stack e. g. "Start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear-starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying device, which tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starring, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float, and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a flipside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of tailors is that they react sensitive to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight equipment doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "" "" "during our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions that are to the core of the cause." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about machines with thousands of moving parts that meet you to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">In decades ago, pilots could fly remote control units that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear ruster.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently, we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest control device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and transverse rusters, no other actuators or Controllers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, in the inner life very much, so that it can fly stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Yet it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to put it to fly, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to look properly if I see all, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in genital siness, this machine is here, the buses with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the great ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in the space to move in any direction, no matter what direction he is rotated or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is conceivable in models, the rest is being learned directly by flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin propeller-aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you accumulate them, they behave like high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong - a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration explores synthetic shame.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We used commercially Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where the room she is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine would like to be a plane screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward is in the development and the production act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, like wonderful and enchanting our universe, and that it allows creative, smart floors to shape them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential, is the tittle on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circling in a very far-distant galaxy in a very far-away galaxy in a tenth of three black holes in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit up bright as all the stars in all galaxies of the well known Universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We sort the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago there was a close-in life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God stands for us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group decided to build a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to look for gravitational waves, which are caused by collionating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as a crazy genius, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation contributed their ideas.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: laser interferometallic gravitational-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of Ligo increased considerably, what improved performance enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015 Ligo was restarted for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the start of the detector, smoked gravitational waves of both collibelating black holes through the ground.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life are emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my token father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All of what I had been working for what I had been working is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, the theoretical physics of black holes and their through observatory like Ligo measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a force in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">While passing the shaft, the space and its whole content are stretched in one direction and perges into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate curacy in courses for the theory of relativity often a truly albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusty, stretch and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched to the waves and ended up. the strain of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This is called 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. God explained the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should just be measured less than an exchange of the radius of a nuclear strike. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt after the waves: "the technical difficulties of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are finalists and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott would like to assert ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what it means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for this way, you can justify a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">For tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">Guide your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics, such as pitch and volume, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking about."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob" by appointment.</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't produce any simple images of objects in All.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by making changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least Ligo measured the measured frequencies in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern to sound, we can literally hear the All literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity is to listen, so much about the collision of two black holes can tell us what my colleague Scott looks very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, flowpen easy: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circular paves with an additional key change. that sounds like that are called: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement of movement, embossed into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo's following: [Surrender of sound] No one knows what he has to hear, this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times of sun mass, which rotate in about as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what it means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in an all, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 sones, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic. fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Many in All, we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserelles stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about this.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see you, because this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation waves are penetrating iron, as it would be transparent glass. the Urball: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is covered by its own light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably most important: I am optimistic that we never saw in all things we have never seen, and of whom we have never seen. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things like in the first attempt we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that make black holes, such as Ligo they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo enables us to experience a completely different angle of events in All, on the creation of stars and ultimately, how we went out of this mayhem.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a brand new generation of observatory on earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">What could be better than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried to experiment a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For a year I would say Yes! "I was afraid of which I feared.</seg>

<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am able to carry out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every programme offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days with four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shipments, which simultaneously production are four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV shows were run on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 this 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not only produced, so still live. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans of campfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, around the world.</seg>

<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>

<seg id="602">"" "" "" "I tell you all of you who work so hard if you are now taking a company, a land or a classroom, take a serious business or a household, so that I'm not only talking about the computer, so that I say, I do not understand that it is not dreams during a dream job." ""</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, everything works, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I engrossed in the work, there is no different feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I stepped up troops when painting on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as to give a high sound, creating a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work it.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and maternal, cruelly and sensible. and the best thing is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums ceases like a busy street, I could go on for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take the sums when I tell them the sums that I write about writing that writing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work with television production, when I began to work and work together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the swum is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't be any different to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be different compared to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">That is what you call the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called Genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's your ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not for the failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want it into question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more things, the more things at the same time, the more things at the same time, the more things more I write, the more things I write, the more expectations it exists.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth, that her mommy is a single job title.</seg>

<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't loved my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titanen work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, no repentance, nothing delege, does not give up, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>

<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just didn't have fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and sums of the sums.</seg>

<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">"" "" "" "but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and the absence of the sum, I can't do anything except for getting up." ""</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed on.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they do not exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky tape and humid kisses, delicate voices, juniper pins and the song in which it goes overs, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" is letting go.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and a burst of energy comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the work environment, the titanium box, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who are you when I tell you who I am when I describe my brain by using broadcasts and TV lessons and how my brain is, then I forgot what the real Summa is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real Summa depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the power that comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real Summa is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real Summa ignores the pressure of history that are to experience, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real Summa is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true Summa is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It just is love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am making it a permanent rule, so that I can release myself as a workaholic of all debts.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play is not very close to me, how do you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer more workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, as what a human being works rather than to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen around in the garden, ahead and back, round and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We are puzzing soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always attacking my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My kids show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! then they always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you stay for naively for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most about 15 minutes, until they think they want something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkranfer or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teenage daughter, all 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, but no need for it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everybody can get 15 minutes on the play, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no storage.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, tired of the kids.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare, my world. it must not be the children. it is true to feel the sums, a place for his peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "playing" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect therein. I'll fail and hope. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" just for everything I was given up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training when I wanted to outpace myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not get 15 minutes away?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums returned in my spare time. the sums seems to return then I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opening up and I find myself back into my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. I owe it to new ideas. I use it in full trains and I love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not me... no longer.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>

<seg id="778">It is a crab that I am a Titan bin. I've never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem plays.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and play more.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious strike or car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very small ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent and serious disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became functional Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"" "surely, they have one of the most famous, the" "" "deep-stimulation condition." "" "it implanates an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function has improved." ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered from fierce trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, is not neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional Neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help yourself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was instructed colonatrician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I used patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that brain traumata brain swelled the brain and increases the skull-pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one must decrease the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this one has to remove a part of brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Rather than throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by doing that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from one tissue, comparable to small children who can be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials, it managed to Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a family culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may still know of the biologic learning that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It's surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation of observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells Hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They comprise 4% of our cerebrum-cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they supposed to receive us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of brain, as we find it in higher concentrations of brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, -- from these cells, we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did by Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they will then mark colour to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planked them at the disposal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- auto transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we state these cells in normal brain tissue not planing? and what will happen if we are unable to plan the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely removed after a few weeks, they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, so they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and not planed exactly the same cells, and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were not planed.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show is these tiny points. these are the cells that we are coloured in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkey with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to pick up food pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable skill level, we injured the cortex in motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, it recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then try to relax with the help of plastic brains. they recover a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand you see the monkeys that fetched spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we were not planed: the same monkey, two months after the irritation plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, we were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about this cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freezing and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathic models, for example with Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate her in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope to show you soon, how human brain can give you the means of healing himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that even now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know somebody who can need this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I am definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are, before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. going out of these great results you have to complete about two kilograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried permission to start clinical trials. if you continue in the future, how many years will it take until someone can come into hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It has a long time to choose the patient, to test the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first reprove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and it's sure of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"" "" "" "we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a course of course." ""</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider her as a immutable theory.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big succummer in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is actually hit by us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">"" "" "" "the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as a finance minister in the eurozone, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the savings, which were realized in Greece." ""</seg>
<seg id="910">"" "" "" "at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my humble friends who would repeat me if it would change anything." ""</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I want to present an economic model for a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yev believes the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truly and defensive democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are dispensed with our future, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On wastage, I want to point to an interesting contradiction that is actually threatened by our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg who raises its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schodenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognizes his dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"" "" "" "a mountain of unexploited money, which, however, is too anxious to invest there, where it would be productive and bring into all the things that could produce and produce all things that are urgently needed, for example" "" "green" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the US, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 billion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until one compares it with 5,1 trillion U.S. dollars, who were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing was doing besides the stock markets and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So, debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds within the U.S., Japan and Europe are unemployed, those who would not invest in a low demand that would not invest, in which they would not invest, that his son might kill him if he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally the circumstances suggest that estrel kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "its extremely fathetic art. All the unproductive capital should be used to further improve human talent and finance especially all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we proceed: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, in which the free and the arms control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy completed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to decrease the importance of Athenian democracy because of these outlines.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the making of the athenic democracy was and is that they gave the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but essential and crucial to them, they grant them the right to political participation with equal voice weighting in question of the heads." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which lights very bright, it is also fast burned.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today, our liberal democracies don't have its roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenical Democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthening the poor, our liberal democracy on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a charter of ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came up only when a complete separation of politics and the economy is possible and the democratic process was bordered on politics during the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democrative free zone became.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time, the separation of politics and the economy began, an inexorable struggle between the two instead of the economy gradually wanders the policy.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no more like that?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is in mind that today one can be in the government and still not in power because the power of politics are waved into the economy and the areas are separated." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"" "" "" "if you think about it, it's like a flock of prey that is so sustainable the animals, from which it feeds on the end, that it is so hungry for the end." ""</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that is so far cannibalized, that it grows by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grow, the inequality is growing, the overall demand and the general staff of corporations are anxious to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "the more successful of capitalism sells the" demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twins, and the greater the waste of human labour power and welfare of mankind." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if this is true, it is obvious that we have to rebuild the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" control "" "," apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners. "" "</seg>
<seg id="950">This is by the way, no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The theory of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only acquire a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by expanding low-globin workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economies and politics are separated, the automation makes the twin summit higher, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is coming soon, as soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we need to redesign the economy and politics to redesign the economy and politics to democrise the reunited area, otherwise we may end the re-united hypercar that will show the film" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">Therefore, the question is, whether capitalism has created the technical achievements that he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">"" "the most interesting question is whether capitalism are resembled through a dystopia, similar to the" "" "matrix" "", "which is resembles that of the company in" "" "Star Trek" "", "in which machines serve people, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" "" "Agora," "" "in long discussions to the sense of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we might be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what did it look like, what could it look like this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of "matrix" similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies, please introduce a capital market where you work and in which your capital is working with you from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then all incomes from capital and redeem and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">"" "" "" "no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not belong in it, but the company does not hear there. there's no exchange between capital and work, no big fan between investment and sphere, and ultimately no emporal twins." ""</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of entire human beings.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "the cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "cosmos" "" "-- and every government is paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade bank of the respective country." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that these funds are investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment is rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that, at that time, the technical means did not implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we, especially in front of the background of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is at the same time liberate, where they preferred privileged people, and Marxist because they buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we be tapped into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we will make ourselves political.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as liberist Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I said just is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "the reason for reunification of politics and the economy is... do we do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand what Larry summers are called" "" "long-term stagnation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next one, as we currently experience it, it is not only our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not wirl, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it's a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein, who said it. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday with the supper of the Redner you have clearly said what you are going from the view of the west to China.</seg>

<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I may say that so provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century today.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- you remember -- we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberalism, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">It was especially sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China, resembles the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Now China must present what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 average minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, it is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the application division of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and above, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that have addictive, where, after having looked for a season, your brain asks: "where is there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should be enough to tell you what's going on at this end of the curve. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not have to fall into the left side of the curve, because I believe you already need special intelligence in order to" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He turns out more thoughts about the mean excursion, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something that's why Roy wants to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where she can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon returns in vain things, you get there, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they will be seen at the watch of this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watched by Roy and his team that brings everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You know when you start the show when you pick paused, which parts will be skipped or looks again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process this and this is the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon ought to make Sitcom for four republican US transators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "alpha House," but it appears that not many of them may remember this show because they were not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company, another manager has plazed a top show by analyzing data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. exactly like Roy is always looking for this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but it's something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team have looked at the Netflix audience's existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that shows her shows, their shows, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went on a car and decided not to make a Sitcom over four transmisers, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has hit a hit at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competent, data reversible companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data together, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic needs to work somehow that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">There is back 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimized it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working so, this is somewhat scary because we live in a time, in which we are more and more to statistics, to make serious decisions, far beyond TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health system is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asking for dismissal, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. instead of deciding if a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. this is not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data being also diversified companies are also false.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is possible to predict analysis of the flu, a terrible way, predicting data analysis of Google's research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news event. the success culminated in a release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the release in the "Nature" magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data versifying firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- in the workplace, in case of dispute, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computerized genetics -- one area, with which some very wise people unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years, I recognized some samples from the difference between successful choices based on data and not successful choices. this pattern should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="1110">You need to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you split this problem in its own parts so you can analyse the individual parts; as second, you put the individual parts again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: to disassemble and assemble.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to resend the parts once again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"" "" "" "if there is something that the brain is good, parts and pieces come together, even if the information is incomplete, a good decision, especially when it is the brain of an expert." ""</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">"" "they use data to better understand their audience, but they have otherwise not been able to collect all these pieces, and make it a show like" "" "House of Cards" "", "which is not in the data." ""</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions first, when they competed for TV ideas, then as" "" "alpha House" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision, because they were always able to say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions with a Ja- or no-question you only have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here in this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have so far made some decisions in my life so I should listen to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much more delicate, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball bounce and clüger, and ultimately it lies on us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that in spite of the great amount of data still pays to make decisions to be an expert in that which you do, and risks to enter.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, there are not the data, but the risks associated with which you end up at the right side of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
