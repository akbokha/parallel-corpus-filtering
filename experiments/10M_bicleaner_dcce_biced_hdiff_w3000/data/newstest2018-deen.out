Munich 1856 : four cards that change your ga@@ ze at the city
an Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are supposed to take place today .
a p@@ inch chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers econom@@ ies the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official card estu@@ ary supports exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s anno@@ ying if land cards are not current .
everyone knows that the car @-@ Nav@@ i had to be showing a green lawn instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , offering an offering of the ant@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria , are anything but actual - but just so very illumin@@ ating .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
then , how towns and municip@@ alities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which is not equal to such such as such .
in the great coverage map , detailed cards were set up for cities and municip@@ alities , so called Ur@@ g@@ ons@@ lau@@ leaves .
this resulted in the Bavarian inter@@ measurement management system between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , and the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon took an overview of the occupied country and issued a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops reached the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 1801 , they were today &apos;s neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ Card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian State Department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ g@@ plant paper for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like to find all others on the Bay@@ er@@ isches Library &apos;s website .
compared early in the morning , the country &apos;s capital is most impressive .
the town has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is under@@ taking that occurs relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the card , as a district of Munich .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses Unter@@ send@@ est focus on 1856 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when ob@@ serving , a smaller piece with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered ranges from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
today , small plots have no more farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 in the 10th century , was actually a me@@ adow and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ur@@ g@@ ons@@ paper you read in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen area not only the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Gast@@ ro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or by the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße one once blocked people with mad@@ ness .
there was the Munich county @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt at the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen there in 1858 / 59 .
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den directed the facility - that psychiat@@ rist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was advanced in his time and ended for example the Ank@@ ets of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied herself for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 280 patients had been first , later on 500 places were extended .
at any time this capac@@ itance was not enough - the reason for construction of the circle of the circle in 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ria .
on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt there are now youth in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian .
the Order bought the building complex in 1920 and moved him to a youth centre with training .
West is located in the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of the cottage from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; was erected in architectural splen@@ did@@ ly on the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt who had been destroyed during bombing ra@@ ids during World War II .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was located at 1856 as the head square , &quot; Kauf@@ inger &apos;s name was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the second world war also brought a decisive change in the heart of the mouth .
the bombs of the Allied Forces out@@ lined a lot of holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses , and a p@@ ylon of the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day began working , and on 5 April 2017 the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil law published travel warning for Mis@@ souri
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the Promotion of Color has issued a warning for coloured people who travel due to discrimin@@ atory policies and ra@@ cial attacks of the state to Mis@@ souri . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ souri , which should come into force on August 28 , 2017 , calls for special attention to travel through the state , as a number of un@@ question@@ able , ra@@ cial sec@@ ures in the entire country , and here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the statement of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent law of Mis@@ souri , which makes people harder to win Dis@@ cri@@ mination , as well as the prosecution of the state , the majority of the state , caused the event to publish the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have violations of the citizenship , human beings .
they will be induc@@ ed or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency which we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that issued the organization for a state in the US .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the police in Mis@@ souri , without being accused of a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also has a recent report of the Mis@@ souri &apos;s Office of General Mis@@ souri by showing that black car driver in the state will be 75 percent more common than white . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; people have to be willing to bring if it had a matter of matter , or let the relatives know they can travel through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ souri reported 100 years of work in the year 2015 , according to the latest numbers from the Trial Chamber of the FBI , the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it harder to su@@ stain a company for resi@@ dency or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued plans for Texas and Arizona , after the United States had adopted immig@@ ration authorities to restri@@ ct people due to immig@@ ration , which will contribute to further pedi@@ gree .
travel warning are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but l@@ ately , stak@@ eholders have adopted the measure as response to certain laws and trends in the USA .
Whe@@ el@@ aun@@ us Project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a success project and will continue next year .
the CDU @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ s@@ ord@@ ed Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have provided a picture on the spot .
the representatives of the fishing villages of the family Schwen@@ demann met representatives of the fis@@ her CDU local community together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann gave insights into operation in which he supplies 55 hectares of grass and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows , and also many young animals , and houses all the houses in five apartments .
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so v@@ ign@@ es .
the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ es comes exclusively regional .
since he is also BA@@ HV @-@ Chairman of F@@ ish@@ bach , he identified the dec@@ aun@@ ching project as &quot; elem@@ ent@@ ative . &quot;
I cannot act on such steep areas .
the Grün@@ land@@ scap@@ ing care of a lot of work needs to be mach@@ ined with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the conditions and to fight with Top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed an@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ic@@ al operation and used this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not conduct bio@@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the dec@@ eit project and is happy with the promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare have to be supported by farmers .
in this way , we hope that the over@@ lap of the surfaces could still be gone out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the subsi@@ dy
a total of 25 plots were fenced in total by eleven participants in 2013 .
the open surface area is 40 hectares that can not be en@@ forced until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of our leader was promoted , a quarter contributed by the municipality of Fishing .
consequently , the farmers stay 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of consec@@ rates .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences &quot; explained hin@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , no farmers and any country of agriculture won &apos;t go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scapes of Land@@ scape ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg provides the state subsi@@ dy of f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black force .
the presence is one of the L@@ PR reported funding transactions .
in addition , the enclosed area may not be bad ( slope for more than 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by collecting .
in 2018 it is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build 16 kilometers of fence .
the surface area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
the White House of Tr@@ ump now takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to start , when they start to attack statues .
the Americans also appreciate the same as any other - hence the cat@@ astroph@@ ic fall Saddam Hussein &apos;s place at fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic stri@@ fe with Jim A@@ cost@@ a of CNN on the proposals of the President of the dra@@ stic restri@@ ction of the legal emig@@ ration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller do not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat cru@@ ises and Liberty Dra@@ it@@ ators would have suffered him if he had done it .
but he took their importance , and in particular the meaning which you were attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ cost@@ a compl@@ ained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an American freedom , which lights up the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this poem , which you refer to , was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is reasonable right , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really around history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemp@@ or@@ ating words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only charges an old immig@@ rant , but the wor@@ m@@ sts of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your trou@@ bles , your poor , / your afflicted masses , which are lon@@ ging to breathe freely , / the poor waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has never been a time in which the &quot; el@@ ying waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
but Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps US .
this conflict is part of a bro@@ ader political and cultural debate : it is in fact a conflict on the meaning of America .
Lazarus , and her friends , who used to place their words after her death at the base - did very well know that she was a highly political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ism as shown in an un@@ used classical illustration of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is not abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself has a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection with the image is brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change their right wing for a long time .
the big scre@@ h@@ room Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 , that the Statue of Liberty is anyone looking for the American Fl@@ ame to the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine through the way in the United States . &quot;
rather un@@ common , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is pushed out here .
the meaning of the statue is quite a matter of a stand@@ point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they had seen by the exhau@@ st@@ ive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys to the de@@ cks of ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of men who are seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the will they have to hear .
and this obviously is not the perspective which Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wish to recognise .
your tor@@ ch should not shine , but hat@@ red , who is the only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black engaged Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members one time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the UK team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World Series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record count of Scottish ath@@ lets was chosen for London 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland a kind of species is developed , &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue it until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish ath@@ lets think that it has something to do with what they have done .
UK athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - can compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle became captain of the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
their capit@@ alists &quot; speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or who they live or exercise , went out of the room , felt very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h was quite natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Common@@ wealth Silver medal winner , which will compete in her fifth world championships for the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unbelie@@ v@@ ably &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots are in the British team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best number of athletes at the World Championship were seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle route Mu@@ ir leads on this road and placed five British and two European records last year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man running after a great season who included the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the man cap@@ tains says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only belonging to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing to be team cap@@ tains , if it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ mate for me voted and voted for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it shows only how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ ems .
what my speech affects as chapters ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , because we have a home World Championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit that we are again at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to block critics via Facebook : don &apos;t throw yourself about a public ministry if you cannot toler@@ ate the consumption of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the papers fell on him because of the interior policy up to its political principles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it sh@@ im@@ ped during the cr@@ iti@@ que , secure .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of freedom can be taken away - and sil@@ ly and dum@@ b we will lead like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ ogan , who needs to work more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees blocked contributions of at least 450 persons and sold their opinions on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained about him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the staff of the Govern@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s very important when it is a type like H@@ ogan expected .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the Nation .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to comp@@ ose himself with his voters and de@@ comp@@ ose his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons , who arrive on the site of the Govern@@ ors - a public forum , is considered officially and by employees who get paid in public tax dollars - unnecessary and eventually dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Mr. Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of Tro@@ l@@ len or sp@@ ri@@ fe @-@ filled people who force the wh@@ ip online .
the post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ ogan expected .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no trol@@ ls .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post office and app@@ eals to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not ugly , but she asked for hat@@ ching .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment field of news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same theme takes place , then they are dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the staff of the Govern@@ ors referred to as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in previous age , if you have done the same thing that employees were dispat@@ ched to collect and burn newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors and to scor@@ ch or demonstr@@ ators to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but exactly that happens now .
H@@ ogan is not the first public officials to be critic@@ ized that he imp@@ acted fac@@ ebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is cla@@ iming by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County disc@@ loses the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they served a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Let@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
that shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
at present , Washington &apos;s time had a similar effect to the Internet .
the number of newspapers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters rendered to his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ ls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers , which made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ized its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping of the UK , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents which were collected by the George Washington Project .
but he did not put them into silence .
freedom of freedom , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true guide means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European Union no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led past year by the arch@@ er@@ field links until the end of the year , was linked to the new venue and acts as tournament sp@@ ies in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great condition .
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is an eag@@ erly supp@@ orter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales looks forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; it really feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as they won in the year after I gained it from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year to win here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to European senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the action on his home .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance at the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel this extra pressure too .

less lung cancer through pas@@ siv@@ ly smoking
in the past two decades , less people have died because of pas@@ siv@@ ity on lung cancer .
as a result , scientists from the University Medical University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) occurs in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after our estimates , 167 mon@@ ary cancer cases are attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved to this topic in 1994 .
back then I gave more 400 lung cancer cases due to pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
construction works at the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and are reas@@ on@@ ably less in time , &quot; says the director of the builder Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house connections , the location is more complicated than susp@@ ects , as the underground is much dirty , which cannot be noted in the plans .
traffic , which is always ob@@ struc@@ ted the construction work , represents a big problem for the part of the silent mu@@ pp .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers in front of red lights and down@@ s is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to pass through .

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , they do not use stove .
they even use a pot but rarely .
in its wood house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ reg@@ ent@@ ele in the non @-@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the carbon@@ ic is harvest@@ ed and dev@@ oured with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture , where she runs her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space is used as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her husband were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work is dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; no one wants to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare glimp@@ se into the daily life in the high@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , who was enrolled in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , as only 1.0@@ 26 elders gave to the occup@@ ying troops in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which dra@@ ined for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jakarta who manages control over the region , and foreign journalists , or legal experts .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea had included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so remote as it is desert . the trip contains a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with approx . 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden homes surrounded by bam@@ boo cabins , and from corrugated roofs that were converted by rust in various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians made their journey here , welded to journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago pap@@ u@@ ans , a god called U@@ GA Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates their vibran@@ t , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; earlier we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the home of Indonesia &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst @-@ mortality rates in Asia .
but there is Indonesia &apos;s Indonesian country .
the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is situated only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort degra@@ ded its value of 3.1 billion dollars of gold and copper .
furthermore , Pap@@ ua has wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua that make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military is pre@@ valent .
a study from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars at one single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic claims according to greater autonomy threat@@ ening these Golden G@@ ans and are handled mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess .
according to activists , more than 500,000 pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped down since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and imprisoned .
according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide in the 1970s , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
last year alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to establish everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report from the year 2016 , in which reports on at@@ ro@@ cities in the previous year are , such as in@@ laws and torture ; ra@@ pe and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims , since each week occurred inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have ampli@@ fied because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a stream of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants is Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , because Muslim economic factors come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ nings sell ro@@ asted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting for keeping here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants began to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ab@@ eth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native to work in the capital of Jay@@ uya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
the President of the President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke out the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua little has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken , because we &apos;ve voted for Jok@@ tan with expect@@ ation that he will meet our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep spot only two months after the Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ ones@@ ian soldiers erup@@ ted on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the fri@@ ghtened children said to them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took the impulse to her tone and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their rif@@ le , spoke sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ um@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was hit as hard that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set up and the things turned on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua women , women and children gathered themselves on a football field in front of local police station and the military command centre to challenge justice .
they carried out cerem@@ onies and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle continuously and a bird sanctuary - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to cap@@ itali@@ ze on police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated up , the soldiers had sent a command over an internal radio . &quot; if the masses have been resist@@ ed more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; is it in an official document of TIM@@ E , which has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ four @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening danger and called for rest and called for the amount to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E was on the porch of its colorful wood house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the people gathered .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times so his c@@ ousin , who was witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and sought his body to make sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indones@@ ians bear only one name , the TIM@@ E was in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ ists that his officers wanted to save their station only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threatened to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the k@@ illings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in Jay@@ uya , where he said sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to the historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , he said that he set an extra@@ judi@@ cial mechanism for settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the talk started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries oc@@ cured long ago .
some were in the 90 &quot; s and the beginning of the 2000 &quot; s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes running through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke to TIM@@ E on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , who was accused of crimes against humanity for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ ev@@ ous unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military , after he helped him to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the dead , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the shooting branches did not cease .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , among them also children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
newly created vill@@ agers protest@@ ing in front of the company &apos;s location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones out on officers that responded to warning shots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( ind@@ ones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who was near from hospital and witness , as the injured one was quickly delivered , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to withdraw the officers of the account and withdraw the police force of the police from the region .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been an un@@ ru@@ sion for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green Highlands of Pap@@ ua .
many of the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) joined the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by attack@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ies of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the Top @-@ O@@ PM guides are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to the recent years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ arily put under custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing the national sover@@ eign@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
among men in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty keeps the dis@@ satisfaction .
some rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as far as range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ ices and vegetables and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work with four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold to the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost 10,000 ind@@ ones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new airlines .
the few jobs , which exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the funds or the necessary abilities to competitive their own company .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Executive Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , limitations of international media remain un@@ cl@@ amped .
in the beginning of the year , French repor@@ ters Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of poor coordination with related institutions in Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign , to increase transparency and development to promote transparency and development , were not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific countries - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investig@@ ate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have histor@@ ically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a Nas@@ ir dismissed the charges of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to waste the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people want to be aware that more foreign governments are taking this knowledge .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , conducted under the direction of the Human Right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and troubled him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but remain anonymous .
Indonesia is a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua would likely say that they will probably not be back for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ committ@@ ees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he wants a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pan@@ i@@ ai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , apart from that it lives under the constant thre@@ ats of a r@@ umin@@ ous military , living in poor education and health services . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other pap@@ ua , will consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; debt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the thre@@ ats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sin offering a last symbolic act of Trot@@ ces : the bodies of a victim was buried on a terrain in front of the police and the military station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know they perhaps will never forget justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us , head down .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai to the book and forced hundreds of inhabitants from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building to flee .
it is the second fir@@ ing that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ house , that one calls it to the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , there were no injuries , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the scre@@ am of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor to get down , &quot; says a residents who named George An@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais Civil Protection agencies said that units of fire @-@ fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 PM ) , the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooling down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said that she work on the provision of accommodations for the suff@@ er@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident may be subject to safety of materials used in outside areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the exterior suit for decoration or isolation , came .
in the UK , the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the system of the plat@@ ters for isol@@ ating and facing the London bor@@ der@@ land Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that died around 80 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
with its big Davis Cup Cou@@ p , the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ single was only supported on two lines , very thin@@ ly did not support the required two @-@ third majority .
that is often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classics remain so well the tradition@@ alists so well .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the countries agreed to reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ g@@ ty was therefore barely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members will not have the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ge@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on to improve the applic@@ ant .
even until the vote , the proposal had already been added to a neutral place after many claims .
new from 2018 are compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host &apos;s right next round in the first round in the first round .
to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , finding out a survey
a pol@@ l below air@@ space resulted in that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously prohibited items in the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled , among them at least 6 percent , which carried out the plane while they acci@@ dentally used knives or other objects with blades .
having claimed less than 1 percent , they had discovered that they had travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explosive .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - performed by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also established that younger trav@@ ellers tend to mis@@ use the rules .
by respon@@ dents , they said that they were illegal to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliber@@ ately included to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said , wis@@ ely objects with blades caused by security control , while 2,2 percent of female respon@@ dents have also confirmed that they had seen inten@@ tionally banned drugs to the aircraft .
the company told it asking travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ fully s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling through the airport security and how many things had done .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who are most happ@@ ily s@@ mu@@ g@@ ly - wis@@ s@@ ingly or un@@ aware - by safety , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain that liquids can take them , or how much of it .
it is no surprise that the largest amount of objects used by T@@ SA are prohibited .
for a time , people thought about T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers Cancel Order
electric @-@ thou@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is pleased with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far he has under@@ gone that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has betra@@ yed one another , less di@@ min@@ ent number in the announcement of the recent quarters of quar@@ terly : the cancellations made by the new mass market 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k had often applied over 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery begins .
finally , Mus@@ k was dre@@ aming : 63@@ ,000 of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been with@@ drawn .
critics have always pointed out that it is only about non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1,000 pound ) &quot; Reserv@@ ation payment &quot; in full .
currently , 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , offered up muscle in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
to date the cancellation of so far , about twelve percent of all orders might be the problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tesla produces 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it will be - all models will be - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , we are currently bookings per day .
those who order today is a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; may be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive their brand new , never tested in the practice tested production lines with maximum occupancy .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to bigger del@@ ays , then the failure of reservations should become a problem for Tesla .
for then , the company cannot prevent mis@@ satisfied customers to run in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chief Pru@@ itt moves back to reduction emissions because of the back@@ drop of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took back his earlier decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g substances .
Pru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be the needs of government environmental authorities earlier than previous generations .
he did not mentioned the complaint , which was raised up against his previous place in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is a deadline , which ran on October 1 for the United States to keep the de@@ pl@@ etion of O@@ zone levels in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in June , Pru@@ ted announced that he will be ob@@ taining to resp@@ ecting his authority over a year to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ fere with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , the prosec@@ utor of Oklahoma was , for a long time , a reliable opponent has been stric@@ ting environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , Pru@@ itt repeatedly has repeatedly declined to block@@ ade or del@@ aying the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal withdrawal for the section on the subject of regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Justice in Washington decided that the EPA de@@ fo@@ rested its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane le@@ cks .
in a review published on Wednesday evening , Pru@@ itt had suggested that his revers@@ al in O@@ zone standards just drove the will@@ ing@@ ness of EPA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of tim@@ ely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA often did not exceed the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then advised to establish activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who accused the EPA over a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judi@@ cial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also accept the law and authority , which gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EP@@ O &apos;s opinion said that Pru@@ itt had to use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all the others legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can Congress in the Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive novel@@ ty of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill in the last month approved the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years delay .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York City &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the EPA in this week , proposed the group planned to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers , and over 115 million Americans that are directly streaming from the smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York found in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power stations , oil refin@@ eries , chem@@ ists and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health and environmental conservation jubil@@ ated over Pru@@ dential changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s troubled , how much pressure does it need to breathe this reasonable step of the responsible for the protection of the air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ori Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to cur@@ b the poll@@ uting and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche the old cemetery @-@ A@@ real in Tum@@ my on Sunday , 16 July , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm for a Seren@@ ade .

visitors of the sixth charity en@@ ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chant himself from this powerful place .
the res@@ cu@@ ing and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made friends and supporters for their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ izes : &quot; it is a unique village . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned in documents for the first time : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the Holy Mass in Tum@@ my with the Vog@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the certificate according to the certificate of the certificate there was also a scenic farm , which belonged to the church or patron saint , and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ used Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , alongside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are currently still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the third , the ancient sett@@ lers of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot;
old maps of the period around the year 1600 cap@@ itali@@ zed this historical events .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ym was formed from the early medieval church law .
a Lord , who built a church , occupied and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit such a church .
thus the right to use a priest or the bishop would have a new priest .
there were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the bigger ones of the two cr@@ ust at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the second world war in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window discs were stolen and the bells were stolen .
the roof was in@@ tight .
17@@ 96 French troops were in the vicinity of the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ bro@@ iler .
in 18@@ 23 the gra@@ vey@@ ard was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the church tower one had to stand .
in the New Years Eve 18@@ 34 the storm sank the church tower and half pl@@ ung@@ ed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished .
only the tower &apos;s tower only existed today , the witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berg and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system as a successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as organis@@ ers invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ my on Sunday , July 16th , at the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery on the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the com@@ bo of the Kepler High School Freu@@ den@@ stadt , with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Matt@@ e@@ is .

the friends and supporters of Tum@@ ling@@ ens feel particularly committed to home use , such as ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organiz@@ ers Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to check approval from wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; is not liable for a legal gu@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for construction and has therefore addressed to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim has denied &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) urged to with@@ stand its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ valley has existed a wind power concentration camp .
within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible , at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the town .
such zones should prevent a &quot; locking of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a few days earlier by changing the area of wind into a second wind power zone in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which , however , had not approved the district government Düsseldorf , because of a lack of mould .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning the author@@ isation of the author@@ isation , the author@@ isation of approval is illegal and therefore also with@@ drawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council once again decided to launch the conc@@ ent@@ ric zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; permission of the District government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the case to permit a permit for the construction of wind turbines to be legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the so@@ lic@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the writing have been received since last week in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it on the occasion to check the matter again .
however , it is not likely to do that the procedure is stopped .
with a view to the administrative district , the circle of the Thursday was not willing to express in content with the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four up to 200 metres high .
already last year , the company , involved in the City of Vier@@ sen , was involved in lease contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of land .
with establishment of four wind@@ energy plants , the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this is equivalent to a fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .
the NEW C@@ re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer there were green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen as well as a stake in a wind tur@@ bine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor che@@ eks together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Nieder@@ flash@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn ) .
a woman was hurt in the process .
two more persons were slightly hurt .
the state road was closed over hours .
after police reports a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car in the accompanying driver with her 53 year old mother as an accompanying person to the L 333 in direction of Bo@@ gel .
town and dealer plan &quot; homeland shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Trade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the City Council want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants for shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the president of the Trade House , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend will sens@@ it@@ ise the customers to disc@@ lose its own city away from the usual supermarket product . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , a market with regional vend@@ ors is planned , similar to the weekly market .
local companies should also present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of downtown for the &quot; midnight Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; should be un@@ loaded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this promotion is not only for inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in preparation are commerci@@ als on radio , an internet video and printed bag that indicate the action weekend so Christian König .
the authorities and pro@@ cla@@ iming to cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus , the sec@@ ditions and the city go into a further highlight of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with selling Sunday , discussions with all the tra@@ ders and hosts to move it into active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and closing on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
customer potential will also be new or more developed .
these include courses and tourists .
but many locals also have lost the city center at shopping in the view .
in the end , all the city would help to anim@@ ate the city center - to the land@@ lords , the entire city and clubs .
it had to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which partly spread , had said King in the spring .
Birgit &quot; &quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared the third &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day for the first time five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ sa , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day sol@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advert@@ ise for the appreciation of the local commerce and make its importance to the council of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the I@@ HK and with many partners also make sure that every citizen with his purchase behaviour could influence its direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump put the thr@@ ott@@ led tran@@ scripts from telephone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border .
tran@@ scripts of telephone call between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called for a phone call on the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , publicly announ@@ cing that he would not pay for a planned border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President compl@@ ained because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump began his presidential campaign with its promise to build a wall in the southern border of the US , and s@@ wore to Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first asc@@ ension with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ t have also been published and reveal a cl@@ amped exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ Bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that the existence on the trade , who would look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would look like a ban on transfer of refugees to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had put the Lord Turn@@ key , &quot; this is the most un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury launched a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ inks to the Ford Bridge from Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es emerged in order to block his way .
the leader of Mob@@ s - A man middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer bra@@ suit - took a long move at his cig@@ ar and looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants cut into fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
sh@@ outs the silence when a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terri@@ fic scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a post@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a but@@ ter@@ flies were thrown around the neck by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 Citi@@ zen to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ col@@ sey , and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever indicted because of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really un@@ true that in all these years , no one person was arrested in all these years , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Brook@@ s who helps in the re@@ location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Brook@@ s is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Georgia and a life for civil rights .
for him , the post@@ ure as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosec@@ utions , we want to do that we want healing , we want reconciliation ; but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to heal and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court case lays a cloth on the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to FBI files , who were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nobody was ever indicted .
although the susp@@ ects has been on foot for decades , citizens can say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice implemented the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote its voice in the summer .
about the same time as the choice stub@@ born according to the FBI , by the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com , a white ground@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle , allegedly committed because of a woman .
Brook@@ s said that rum@@ ors had been in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore , was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison so that the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and their cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when they approached them from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge was approaching , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared and arranged Mor@@ a , &quot; includes a FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a complete set between state and local prosec@@ utions , which was not only involved in Mor@@ den &apos;s evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brook@@ s is still form@@ ulated .
&quot; it was a voting right &quot; massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed , to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has guided the annual retro@@ spective of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her view is descri@@ p@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is based in a sort of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe he does not exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to look at , and more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confron@@ ted with the ugly in us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to or listen to what I have done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest black - into a room and e@@ at@@ ted , as Gre@@ ene started a well tuned overview of the play .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief C@@ lan@@ cent@@ ds since years , but he said that the role never becomes easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to maintain this story in life because we don &apos;t want to return to those days . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester try to play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester call@@ eth and troubled him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n -- he , van@@ ish from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shave do@@ v@@ ents the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody leaves ( at least every black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still che@@ ating .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ th one of the other black actors .
&quot; you must meet only the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there is the energy in space , a sense of c@@ amer@@ amen will replace the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is busy to get this correctly , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Raz@@ cona tells the N @-@ word he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this rep@@ et@@ ition is violent and fast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are terror , nuts and then silence .
a woman , clothed in a g@@ ird dress , stands on the bodies of actors and endor@@ ses Che@@ ven@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice canc@@ els every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it caught a group of about four dozen people sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , arriving to see the performance , many come down the street .
you have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as impressive moisture every eight hours when Brook@@ s runs on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you were on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
if the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites you to get closer and inspect the dead body .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , counter@@ f@@ eit blood and quiet bodies and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he will remember .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks so much - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors take the Lyn@@ x back and wi@@ pe off her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw surro@@ unds Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit that the C@@ lan@@ member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his co @-@ players and breaks along with her arms , the emotional burden of performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pered one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this out of one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience put together the actors together with the actors .
at a table a white pair from Atlanta depic@@ ts a white pair of Atlanta showing the reproduction with a black couple , which they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski said therefore to find words , which feeling his performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to listen to these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and do that , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does it do with me , I will believe that the Lyn@@ x still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only police shooting is called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Brook@@ s Hof goes to his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demand is inspir@@ ational in a way , because it describes the terror of what we end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

max amount works as volunteers
they work at several sites in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt , a furniture shop once in the week , I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have been working at school for an open all day .
how are your experiences with that ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide range that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , so a late volunteer .
how does this come ?
quantity : I did my Abit@@ ur .
and then a engineering graduate studies , let &apos;s say successfully .
I recognized for myself that it is for me and I want something else to do with people .
and then I wonder@@ ed what are you doing .
make a social year , there is a glimp@@ se , there you can see how it is spot , at the focal point , perhaps , really is .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
during the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system .
I will study in the school , probably studying a social worker and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not a bit unusual , during volunteer work to have several different locations ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on how to make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from age @-@ ms to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me that was exactly the right thing for me .
I could realise my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
other than in engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about to exp@@ ire St@@ ati@@ ques .
there are always other people above the head , each with a different story behind .
whether a refugee , a youth who has been out of the family - one must always go down individually .
very interesting .
and you did not have touch fri@@ ghtened ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , plenty of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son delivers another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce more 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as a further restructuring programme will start to overcome the pressure that the company is confron@@ ted with .
in addition to the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , the job mining director John Fall@@ on announced in addition to its previous restructuring , even 4,000 points were lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business which was hit by the fast step towards digital learning .
the company , which had sold his shar@@ ehol@@ ding in Penguin Rand@@ om House on Ber@@ tel@@ smann &apos;s partner , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.0@@ 05 billion pounds was achieved in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy Attack of Kabul : NATO @-@ soldier killed at suicide bom@@ ber
a suicide bom@@ b@@ ord has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killing soldiers of Nato , and injured several others .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ters were viol@@ ated , NATO distributed a statement by NATO .
as a result of un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed during the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing has been the last violent that Afghanistan have taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ bed killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of Nato , the explosion began on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan Army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this asser@@ ts that all injured are in a stable condition and will be treated at the air@@ field in Bag@@ ram at the air@@ field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the rising strength of the Taliban and the group known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian victims in Afghanistan for the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in capital .
at the end of July a suicide bom@@ om@@ aster killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had made this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the fatal f@@ ain@@ ant attack of the country , since the US led troops fired power to power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ ari@@ ous safety situation in Afghanistan , since US President Donald Tr@@ ump , the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kabul may have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy , and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule by complaints .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of government by Obama , abol@@ ish the United States to con@@ strain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step@@ per accused . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Control 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said she will show the commitment to the agency to cooperate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and hereby that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott Pru@@ itt , in a declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to reduce pollut@@ ant emissions , in which in a part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions should be determined to establish a more str@@ ingent quality standards - to delay more str@@ ingent quality standards - by October 2018 .
a group of 15 most Democratic states , along with the District of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to raise a wide range of environmental issues that the former president Barack Obama impos@@ e on economic growth , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the return of demo@@ c@@ rats and protected groups to worry about the effects of larger emissions to public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce the lung function and boost the respir@@ atory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal budget wants common room
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , the decision was clear : with two opponents , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn win@@ kling decides to set up a common room in the future residence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still lack of land was signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
although the church community belonged to parish ownership , it is now not a plan to date , but there is no planning for a private investor to participate in a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and majority of the council is not bo@@ ther@@ ed such a common room just as meeting point for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ equ@@ itable housing , but open to the community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an example , the word &quot; kn@@ it@@ ess &quot; made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the decision which has been decided by providing means for the ongoing budget was already chosen last autumn by funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
the establishment of a community room would be reported to represent T@@ j@@ ads , with 60 percent charged 30 percent .
the decision to sign@@ alize the investor believes that in this regard , no b@@ yp@@ sies would throw between the legs , the conclusion that both artic@@ ulation - what to reduce the ambient level - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what the tr@@ ump sum reduces and building economic power - would be possible .
need@@ less to say so just Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer is this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he happens to the body .
not as easy as it goes to the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which you don &apos;t come across so well , therefore you rest yourself with the common room from the window , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is essential for the common room - but absolutely against public participation .
behind it , she sees a conc@@ e@@ aled subsi@@ dy with its as@@ part@@ es or even foreign investors .
unless you don &apos;t do that , as with the purchase of an area , you don &apos;t give an allowance , but get a real , in case of doubt , is the counter speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s application , correspon@@ ded to the decision , finds three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we are going to get a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund to David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup is taking place without him : David Al@@ aba is forced to absor@@ b the game against Dortmund .
with HR solutions , FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first challenging game of the new season .
seven professionals are lacking the tit@@ le@@ holder in the Super@@ cup against the Trophy .
the HR @-@ record staff at the German soccer record from Bavaria Munich will always be greater in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Poker &apos;s Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to ren@@ ounce to David Al@@ aba in Du@@ el with the Bv@@ B .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neuer , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
An@@ cel@@ otti had been responsible for the five defe@@ ats in the past six months and made the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was last not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in a performance increase in the first official game of the season .
&quot; soccer is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great trust that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intensive game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two german football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans in their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , shared the German soccer league ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin of star to w@@ ander to star
the nationwide first &quot; star path &quot; should be built in the Harz Mountains .
I had this plans to the Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there has been a planet in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the information needs of many har@@ p visitors , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he provides nature , science , motion , and sporty performance .
members want to place along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the first phase to 2018 the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Acc@@ essi@@ ble installations is planning to five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Brown , Brown , Ho@@ he@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tables should be completed by the Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection .
also accessi@@ bility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star gate train to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path the viewer will discover much knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , although he is considerably away .
also , in which constellation can find a chosen star and when he &apos;s best to see .
the association operates since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the National Park is according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation for the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy are often seen with the naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ City , the Planet@@ arium Go@@ ds has been on initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen since 2003 , such as the planned star rating .
starting in front of prayer hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads up to the Hain@@ burg and for ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the St@@ els with the individual planets - including the ge@@ d@@ warf planet Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely placed in a distance and a scale of one to two billions .
the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , at least 70 centi@@ meters away .
the entire distance from the planet is four kilometers .
while the light requires sun to the Plu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need one hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are quicker than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fixation only would last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia to set up the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the defeated World Boxing Council Light@@ weight champion , which went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ er Champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
Garcia was stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How are you doing , Champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 : 00 pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the couple posed for pictures , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Climate , noted that a possible show@@ down between the fights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perfect mag@@ n@@ itude &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; remembered Garcia .
&quot; I grew up for Bronze &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so great .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to be back to light weight .
and he has to move to light weigh@@ ting &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate change asked if it should be at Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy to agree with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to include a date in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their Light@@ weight champion in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked after him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia and pushed forward to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this type of attention .
when always ready ... &quot;
Garcia was saying , he reck@@ on Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday combat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he don &apos;t think about the Tri@@ athlon Cup from River@@ side , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry Mik@@ ey ... you were willing to make the co @-@ off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Garcia said the focus is to show impact strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel the Mom@@ entum , who built for his own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tyre space
on Thursday afternoon , four people were injured during an accident on the A7 .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost about 16.@@ 30 in front of the connecting site to a tyre that would probably control over his vehicle .
the car dra@@ gged onto the right into the bu@@ ck where he moved and then remained on the roof@@ top roof@@ top strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the first power supply of the li@@ fe@@ jacket , the A7 was locked in the direction north for about one hour , and the traffic on the left strip could be settled at the accident site .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; spin chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener that optim@@ ise the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , there were not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to do better in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders from Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the triple chain should be further optimised .
and a fool according to a free throw away the sa@@ unas too much more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be so no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) line on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will even be better adapted to the prepar@@ atory chain in preparation with the qu@@ ilt chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is safe to build on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for that we have even better harmon@@ ize and we do not afford so many mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you cannot speak after an un@@ decided start of a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could well be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and we will certainly be able to focus on the cup of poker , we will certainly be able to talk by a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but his coach wanted nothing to know about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I only anticip@@ ate after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e only because the game of Saxony has to be canc@@ eled due to a we@@ ather@@ proof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , they can begin the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann to be a bit more fresh@@ er since they had no heavy and full game like Fortuna for an asc@@ ension favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inter@@ def@@ enders of Fortuna .
indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland go as a lighter favorite in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will leave them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el , whose balance in only a defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games is quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no squ@@ ad in the 2nd league , which one has to beat from before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Che@@ f@@ coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; such a statement would make arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ en@@ don &apos;t want to see his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application assessment are published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years old . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Ministry of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Cou@@ ts@@ ar@@ al@@ am@@ ket ) has started with the performance of tests last year .
they should take more precisely during the asylum proceedings to make an assessment of the age after the Swedish migration Authority ( migration of migration ) was critic@@ ised by some refugees in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees .
until today , migration of 6,@@ 880 was sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results from a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that the person was &apos; possibly 18 years or older .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests will only be performed in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged for more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers has lied about its age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said it was 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the requested person was 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det had published the 5@@ 81 results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said frank@@ ly that it was 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment carried out at x @-@ rays of K@@ nie@@ gel@@ es , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ized in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work involves the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they earlier or later passed through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
to judge the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it for sure , we should not do it as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson , of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is incorrect .
the biggest risk is in this case , if the person is less than 18 , this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 car between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
a seven tonnes of heavy concrete elements on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it is going super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , manager at the Department of Transport and Traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , work began on all three rehabil@@ itated bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end is scheduled for October and glue is sure to hold the schedule .
the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge of concrete , lined with red bun@@ ches and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and the traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Bru@@ ck@@ cap .
this is an edge attachment that is also used as an operating path .
a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap should be used on Friday in the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way will walk .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bou@@ illon arms .
special finger @-@ feeling has the laying of pipes due to the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished at first .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach entrance is the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridge dates are 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower Protest at German potato sal@@ at
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not so frequent to pull parties at one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) comes together , which is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance that displays this day peac@@ efully on this day because the AF@@ D is invited to a loud poster &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and known names of the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who formed the top duo for the German elections on September 24th , and the Deputy Chairman of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are at the beginning of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to AF@@ D developers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally , the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All on a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was planned on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum One World and one of the author@@ itative organiz@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old potato sal@@ ine that could easily eat the AF@@ D &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police reported many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly from the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did AF@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the AF@@ D volcanic eggs reports , he tried to make such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in her Dau@@ n to get there a cancellation , because because of the already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , the ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ front he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : at 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle , several speakers , including the rh@@ et@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic AF@@ D Chairman Uwe Young .
in the room there are about 200 list@@ eners , who are waiting for the top candidate for the German elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch &apos;s speech .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour is the AF@@ D event , the guests at the fore@@ court have a longer breath , but there is some time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can turn back - no special events .

both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is solo@@ ist the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both un@@ ites the desire not only to exceed the boundaries of their instruments but also the limits of different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach on the two as in a new ob@@ jection , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos; Welt@@ musik &quot; un@@ ites with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ re@@ ist@@ itor N@@ ils W@@ ogram , together mix classical , jazz and free play to a fascinating general art work .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I would like to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart openly about their bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I arrive in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was to her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately went bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all that the brunette woman was assured that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with love that I have sli@@ pped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation Kri@@ sten had said that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived with du@@ alism and seriously believed .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I never really liked to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school@@ ing as they prefer like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven told me the kids I would look like a Bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , fri@@ ghtened and damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and remember : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t love to love her love life : &quot; people expect you to look for a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me as und@@ am@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify me before the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
whether you like it or not , the demo@@ c@@ rats removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you than inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ l .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke to a big announcement in the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice does not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only million@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes prove that he has coal mines in five states , and inher@@ ited from his father a coal business .
it &apos;s worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee gave a declaration on Thursday night , in which it said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , which would work to us rather than to make our country great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legisl@@ ative bodies in history , the announcement of a party , which is from above to bottom , is not able to find a positive , reas@@ oning message &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said R@@ NC chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for doping @-@ sc@@ andal
the world leader of athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , comm@@ ended on Thursday what he described as obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a D@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ umed in the sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s athlet@@ ics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the eve of the athlet@@ ics world championships on the eve of the athlet@@ ics world championships , that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight the doping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were swe@@ ating at competitions gold and silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed on in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) of government @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia had been found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has experienced that she has experienced some quite hot times and everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased , &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress were achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always , that we wanted to separate the athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will begin at the athlet@@ ics world championships , which begin on Friday in London , compete with strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the director of the IA@@ AF Task Force , Rune Ander@@ sen , said that Russia had still met some of the criteria for re@@ modelling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dro@@ pping tests are still in@@ sufficient and prohibited train@@ ers are still active , he said repor@@ ters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a fun@@ eral march for Mali inc@@ ited soldiers
around 1000 people of the two were born with a helicopter in Mali in a fun@@ eral ceremony at the North @-@ H@@ essi@@ an Frit@@ z@@ lar .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral under high safety precau@@ tions .
on the still un@@ explained reasons , the Minister of Defence , Ursula from Le@@ yen ( CDU ) , said nothing .
but they called the two commented pilots but as &quot; C@@ utt@@ ner of their trade . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to deliver us before this highest sacrifice , which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old chief captain from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their sentences were transferred to Germany and handed over from a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr to the cathedral of St. Peter on Thursday .
at first , only the relatives left the Church in the Church .
after that , the fun@@ eral took place in the circle of family , close friends , representatives of the army and politics .
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the general editor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
the mour@@ ning was down , and the relatives of his arm were arm in his arm .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the Minister of Defense by the Le@@ yen called the converted soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and pic@@ kl@@ ed .
the bar key took up the flight operations of the Mar@@ tial artist Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six @-@ trained Tiger pilots of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ents , to which the soldiers belong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not waste the crash , nobody would have missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dou@@ bts about the UN Mission in Mali , the Minister of Le@@ yen was no doubt : the commitment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country we only separated from two countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral , the reb@@ ate were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr does not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife by his wife .
this was the last of the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish princess is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , whose name was in the message .
where Prinz Hen@@ rik was buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ end to be buried in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik never had a H@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
he would like to be king after the thr@@ ill of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 .
in 2016 , he went into retirement and gave the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es &quot; as well .
since Hen@@ rik did not receive the title and function , which he wanted , he will not see himself compared to his wife , nor after death , said LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will be ultimately , be un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ end to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the past 50 years .
born in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , the son of a French ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ ratic , was born in London in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , however , Prince Hen@@ rik participated in his almost 50 @-@ year @-@ old Reg@@ ions at the Dan@@ es as a heavy stand .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything was done , what I did .
my Danish happened , I preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ ber str@@ uts instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of social @-@ critical intel@@ le@@ ct , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not feel ashamed .
there were two mistakes . &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re@@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ objective &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is following the loss of red @-@ green government majority for rapid re@@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign .
because he spoke on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament .
previously , the surprising ex@@ iting of a Green Party in Lower Saxony had thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months prior to the official date of the country election the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their short @-@ vote majority in Parliament to the opposition of CDU and F@@ DP .
the former Green deputy El@@ ke T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ed its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
S &amp; D Group President Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to the Group .
they would have the CDU and F@@ DP together 69 seats in the lower Sax@@ on Parliament , the SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be voted on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green provincial government now decide whether they could continue to reg@@ ain in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil seems to be essential , however , that the country day resol@@ ves rapidly to resol@@ ute its self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the state of state also sees the possibility that the country of Minist@@ ers sel@@ ects confidence and elect a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these options must be legally aud@@ ited , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all the questions in peace when legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the West &apos;s step &quot; but a bit strange . &quot;
the politicians itself stressed : &quot; I am not a reven@@ ant .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called himself as a b@@ unch of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the un@@ n@@ igh@@ ten@@ ing members on the return of their landing ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are , of course , that they have received their land on land , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the presi@@ ding met@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hannes Swoboda , S &amp; D Group president , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests un@@ exceedingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the fra@@ ction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no in@@ trin@@ sic differences that we cannot skip this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD @-@ Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns Nazi leaders El@@ ke T@@ ests as a betra@@ yal by the CDU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of Socialists on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the country day .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in her fr@@ ust their personal interests before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welfare of land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty int@@ act game and tries to beat political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ fac@@ t@@ ens CDU faction manager Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CDU .
the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the v@@ ests before , with the personal career of career the outcome of the 2013 country election .
the CDU was then the strongest force in front of the SPD , the SPD and the Green Party had a very thin majority in the country .
agriculture Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ er , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany discuss p@@ seu@@ ed eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Regional Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ ell@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states set up the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
the eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is virtually excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
the food surveillance is the task of the states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off , and has since become acquain@@ ted with the authorities in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and health .
if with eggs , the resi@@ li@@ ent temperature of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not bu@@ si@@ fied .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the businesses are not to blame .
are production facilities and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the knowledge of knowledge , the manufacturing facilities does not take immediate fault .
rather , they must deal with regard to suspected of illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always , in the harvest , there is too little Control@@ lers .
is it missing only at the staff or also on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
just the official controls , which have covered the process .
however , to the truth , food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
for this reason , a consistent establishment of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are in cases where off@@ ences are of decisive importance .
several times have I made many times , that I expect a consistent explanation of the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm molecules in food and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and traffic @-@ ready food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in food industry , consumers and consumers are entitled to law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the pan@@ elled means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il is not acceptable in the attitude of life @-@ related animals and must be stopped immediately .
it has to be rig@@ or@@ ously consistent on all levels and with high pressure .
I expect of all the relevant authorities that the atomic fact is rapidly and picked up .
how can Finance rules work on Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEFA yet , for the executive organization that monitors the European game has super@@ vised the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules which have been called by UEFA brings to life in 2011 means that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to the Brazilian , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary , which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ ars moving to France .
PS@@ G can easily make money with security , that Ne@@ ym@@ ar signs and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , in view of the financing of the teams caused by the energy rich ruler of Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs may apply to purchasing players a lot of money , but must have legitim@@ ate income sources , which allow them to gain the break @-@ even point in their home @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that Ver@@ eine , who had huge debt in their quest to success , were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked , when banks or owner managed to withdraw their support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , FF@@ P fell from the concentration on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - invested a club with potential and then invested strongly to build the team and to build a global brand - become a harder case .
during the current Thir@@ ty @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period , the clubs can take losses of € 30 million in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini fell from the presidency of the Presi@@ dency , his UEFA @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in will continue to stop off excessive expend@@ itu@@ res .
&quot; certainly the FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the future , has been responsible for The Associated Press last week .
although PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clau@@ se of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package deal , it may distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five year contract for the next five years amounting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has made the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time , 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season took place on 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .
the UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to super@@ impos@@ e their financial attention by joining their revenue by companies , which are connected with owners of a clubs .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ist company could transp@@ osed PS@@ G &apos;s value , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship should exceed the standard market positions , UEFA this would not be considered as legitim@@ ate income .
this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come from the organiz@@ ational Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will simply be out to find out a such man@@ eu@@ ver for the UEFA regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA still is attentive to observe any attempt to avoid the rules .
the UEFA had no prepared talks on PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , so on Thursday the people are familiar with the situation .
they spoke about the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity by The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive on arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ates .
the association assumes that the sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent ne@@ ym@@ ars away that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financing doping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to cat@@ ars last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal &apos;s Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by American Sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservation of La League against a State which financed a society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and this has changed the whole landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial potential Fair@@ play because there is different ways , or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new gi@@ og@@ gi@@ ate supplier
Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y on board cho@@ col@@ ates for Swiss Life in recent years .
now the k@@ is@@ ses cooperate in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the contract .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ eh@@ ra@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA in the news coverage of the newspaper Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z . &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would check every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current suppliers Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
some 17 million small red @-@ white packaged ch@@ apped boards will distribute to 14 grams a year before landing on the passengers .
the Swiss does not want to make any details about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry in@@ sider estimates the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but most import@@ antly , the advertising effect : for a ch@@ og@@ gi@@ producer , it is a prestigious order .
as many applicants are given to the new announcement , the Swiss will not betra@@ y .
but only Swiss manufacturers come in question .
according to newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to try a renewal of the treaty via spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not achie@@ vable for a review .
chocolate bars are distribut@@ ing Swiss Life since 2006 on board of their flights .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has built in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss placed two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .

impact against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police succeeded in doing a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ district , in R@@ ott@@ weil , Konstan@@ z , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , have searched numerous objects like the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office on Friday .
at the age of 25 , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years later and issued warran@@ ts against this arrest warrant .
Moreover , the officials ordered bigger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros .
in the same period in Italy , two persons were arrested .
there was German warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will therefore probably be shipped to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were used .
members of the Mafia organised drug criminal , severe violence , attemp@@ ted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s public prosec@@ ut@@ ors have been determined since the summer of 2016 .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Const@@ ance and Palermo there was an exchange and investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po R@@ ott@@ weil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the large deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the visual acu@@ ity of the studies , Italian nationals with en@@ rich respect to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
a incident occurred on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant at the early mor@@ nings , could go to the gang &apos;s account .
ways lam@@ ents big g@@ aps in fore@@ ig@@ ner @-@ Registry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data of citizens who shouldn &apos;t appear there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report says the fore@@ ig@@ ner regist@@ ers in Germany are considerable lack of defects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partial dis@@ agreements with asylum procedures .
according to the government management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , a media report , according to a media report , according to big g@@ aps in the Dutch register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lack of defects detected in the data could lead to serious problems with asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis related to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the regist@@ ers , ten million people are attri@@ but@@ able to foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be managed by about 600 events in Germany .
because the data has not been kept sufficiently well , the quality of data in parts has not been well done so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in some cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by men who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ law@@ ed data inputs can be considerably slow@@ ed down considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on immig@@ ration , people are covered by EU citizens who would not have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; such mis@@ direc@@ tives led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate about dealing with trav@@ ellers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means it is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government had begun to send refugee families with under 16 year old children back to Italy when they came from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this goes out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Osnab@@ ru@@ cker Zeitung reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , this means BA@@ MF to perform such procedures for families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , the newspaper posted to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU State is responsible for refugees to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this State can send him back to the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; note : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has greatly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) is sufficient for these additions .
other EU countries would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatened due to lack in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a threat of childhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach lives to people who were already made available to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
all of Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile divided into 50 litres of blood with his own 100 donations .
traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the council imp@@ lies multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingen@@ ious , like our body is created and we delic@@ ately make the spi@@ ke respect that their blood for foreigners are available , even more un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood don@@ ating helps several people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the cru@@ iser of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the con@@ serv@@ ations are dismant@@ led in their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus three people could benefit from a blood donations .
at the same time Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported from the actions taken in the spring in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K roundabout . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theater house has led to higher participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ es were awarded to the multiple sclerosis and were awarded each 50 .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening inflation have sub@@ du@@ ed the spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deals &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain when they maintain interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the polic@@ y@@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for increasing the increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 % by 2018 and warned that pressure on household income would continue to rise to almost 3 % in autumn .
but they sign@@ alized that in the coming years , interest rates would be necessary to breed the inflation of Bre@@ xit would possibly be more than expected to climb on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mam@@ mo@@ ist business package that was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will demand time for financial planning to deliver cheaper financial resources for banks , although it is expected that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds worth more at this system - with 115 billions of pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real rise of households continues to be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain level of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets are expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets most likely to increase the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank did not stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forecast adjusted down@@ ward growth forecast for this and next year is 1.9 % and 1,7 % compared to the previous year .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent disappo@@ inting growth numbers s@@ damp@@ en increasing expectations on a rate of interest and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has increased to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easily restored after the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and lower wage increases , as the resulting is worse and even worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy in the next few years can &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages are much to recover at the end of their thirty @-@ year plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to weak pounds , resulting in part of lower consumer spending . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision takes a year after lower@@ ing interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August after the sho@@ cking EU voting , which caused the sin@@ ks of the sound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
before the final decision of the bank to the interest rates , the call for a interest rate was increased because inflation increased pressure on hard involved households , with three political decision makers in July gave rise to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen in the last month of 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to be with@@ drawn again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank told that the excess of 2 % is to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly given to the weak Po@@ unds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the short@@ age of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market would be more competitive again , because the len@@ ders would like to finish lou@@ dly after shops and end this year in a positive manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing deal exp@@ ires and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with extra @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to drive un@@ disputed HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transformed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV pre@@ ventive therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse taken the pre@@ positi@@ onal phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk samples by about 86 percent , now also delivered by healthcare to a first three year study for estimated 10,000 people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared himself to finance the trial after the Court of App@@ eal affir@@ med the decision of the Supreme Court in the past year to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess event announced on Thursday was announced by N@@ HS England CEO Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) received this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crucial moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health health risks in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first , which will enable registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ positi@@ onable phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a sequence of HIV supplements which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP was significantly reduced to HIV transmission in danger of infections .
to take Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or so two hours before the intercourse .
to those who come into question should be gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who were not treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who are living in England and registered with a family physician can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexu@@ al@@ clinic .
the program is signed at £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the medicine in this week following an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ EP by clin@@ ching clinical evidence how it is used in a large scale , recorded and implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and bring increasingly successful efforts to prevent and over@@ take HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in tack@@ ling one of the biggest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , when specifically ge@@ ared towards needy and vulner@@ able people , the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September on , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS finance try to develop a new instrument that is actually checked individually and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Ter@@ r@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be carried out that the study is quickly done throughout the country and that nobody who has left a risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test was provided , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , a shadow of health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP trial is welcome and ob@@ sol@@ ete after months of delay and delay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt takes us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the distribution of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living great life : mezzanine and clever designers tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t packed bags and sold her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much greater space , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I sought something similar to my price .
I was shown in Ear@@ ls Court in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made a quote this day . &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot of the square was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a sp@@ oo@@ ed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne storage space and one mezzanine add to the best ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
to this end , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development but also a place for Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had to think creative to resolve the awar@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the spaces so arranged to be over@@ thrown by each other , without having to shed ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement makes it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper engraving from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks across the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors play a role while adding theat@@ res , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make it longer .
in the kitchen the refle@@ ctions feel like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen , if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important that if you push the door high , very light gli@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ ly use of space and storage room Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate mak@@ ler will enter and make a calculation based on the ground @-@ size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high quality materials , which provide space to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t care in the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something different in something unique .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave these .
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a debate because of one of the largest real estate im@@ per@@ ien Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its business will be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation occurs in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers have accumulated 38 real estate ads in value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now en@@ comp@@ asses offices in Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sorrento , the apartments in Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Colin - by Paul is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operators and domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judi@@ cial institution said that Colin property is valued at $ 316 million in value of 176 million dollars .
the allocation of property and cash turned out to be a precise point for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the one of Colin proposed divisions have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
brothers now struggle to control over the existing business - of which Colin and John claimed to be excluded .
Colin ar@@ gues , this is not true , but also raises Paul outside , some poss@@ essions in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he was hoping to teach the argument .
&quot; my Italian heritage saying that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs are in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and charter buyers , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , including Allen My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held by lawyers .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rant , the dairy and delic@@ acy stores of the late 1950 &apos;s , and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck bought .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Colin the first je@@ ans re@@ stores the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colin says that he began to West@@ co as he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes to pass their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land to the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of the De Lut@@ is company group , whereby Colin it claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars at leaving the company .
both Luke and Mark are , &quot; Paul &quot; says the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has kept back very much , although he served a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 of Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain with our family names through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in writing to the dish that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our case will be solved in the near future by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new staff is planning to restri@@ ct the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IC@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a uniform course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , together with executive staff , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : bad news , getting into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or post@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by super@@ v@@ ise his media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to TV is back for decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his tel@@ ev@@ ing is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed for a un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places who were persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election advisor to Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards POL@@ IC@@ ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter Hab@@ its under control , according to six former election campaign in it , to ensure that his personal media account contains a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter has ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is ri@@ di@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps this fight officials may know something that we don &apos;t know yet - that tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets could contain more combust@@ ible without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his colleagues managed to cope with him a few times , trouble was worth it .
but no one has consistently avoided it preventing Tr@@ ump conv@@ usses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the problem exists that people are in a white house that re@@ alizes itself from competing parties , re@@ iter@@ ate their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material that may support their views from the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IC@@ ICO - which deals with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to medi@@ ate the President of strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press releases , especially those with dam@@ aging le@@ aks , and that he asc@@ ends to find out where these come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone accused a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet &quot; Prov@@ oc@@ ate@@ urs , Charles C. Johnson , gave the source behind a he@@ ap to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Johnson was banned from Twitter , or that he has not offered a specific evidence , or that he expressed false alle@@ g@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask fellow workers about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as the most effective manager , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors still stri@@ ve for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ host@@ ly crimin@@ als get post of Europ@@ ol
as the address is unknown , the people will pray and hop@@ ed for the people .
the police sent out all over Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
as the addresses of looking forward s@@ words naturally cannot be known , evidence from the population will be hop@@ ed and pra@@ ising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol was reported on Friday from the promotion , which follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience would have shown that many vol@@ atile holiday situations would hide from Europ@@ ol .
you have compiled 21 postcards from 21 EU countries for selected crimin@@ als .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ anne , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed .
36 of the online dating have so far been arrested , at least eleven of them based on the publication of the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the weal@@ th@@ iest home@@ owners in West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute trav@@ ellers on war@@ fare , which negoti@@ ated one from the municipality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tren@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
travelers have their 20 caravan on a field outside of a weal@@ thy street of Soli@@ hull par@@ ked which is called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of Transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May , without being deported from one of the excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the tac@@ tile group found a gap in defence and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry people have afflicted the Council of Soli@@ hull that told it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous owner said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were tra@@ pped on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath to have cast stones into the p@@ asser@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be forced to implement the action in action , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May , moved on and are now back again .
more than last night arrived , probably still more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of Birmingham knows how to handle long teachings out to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my audience , if the Council could not even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local residents who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ri@@ di@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these trav@@ ellers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the car area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of the un@@ authorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal steps so quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our motives , it is very important that if many local residents are an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police , calling them 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we suggest our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is situated from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof hotel .
the house in front of the gates of Freud &apos;s house is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on March 1 next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambi@@ ance of business society mbH on 13th April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also proceeds from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , with dramatically rising numbers of refugees , offered into the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up an earthquake in order to secure the area as a hotel site .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the council .
but in particular , Freud &apos;s Mayor Os@@ s@@ wald def@@ ended the site in front of the hotel and spoke of serious interested parties at the time .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer has been purchased with a seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will make it again to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men .
you are called hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof are standing before the entrance , and when you enter the house , the extensive renov@@ ations will be made .
the floors have been torn , blan@@ kets are min@@ ed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it &apos;s a nice place , &quot; said Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large enter@@ tained showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
everything should be &quot; nicely close , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expres@@ sing itself .
&quot; we want to make a gem . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
it would not be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher city center , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms w@@ anting to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual tourists , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se did it , so Sch@@ erer .
the vision of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
once the investment is asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not willing to define exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
external services are also transferred to front axle , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard a large terrace which is accessible by the restaurant which is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; joy@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Repres@@ ent@@ ative Appro@@ ach Grand Jury
in the Russia Aff@@ air by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special Repres@@ ent@@ ler Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have chosen a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in recent weeks , the Panel recorded the work , &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under appeal to the cause of trusted people .
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened its investigations and intensi@@ fy its investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CNN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CNN says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is already the first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
US intelligence agents accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have committed themselves to the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines if there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps Election Bal@@ aam and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men should stand in the election campaign as a rep@@ lic@@ t of rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in a few weeks ago that the special issue of Tr@@ ump was personally ad@@ mi@@ red into the centre and if the president perhaps have ob@@ struc@@ ted the justice of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to prove and decide on possible damages , and decide whether it is charged .
Grand Law@@ ys shall therefore also be called n @-@ chambers .
usually they are switched on if it is a larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always followed behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on from the public prosec@@ utor to charge individuals for the hearing under E@@ id .
according to the radio stations , courts have already been issued to rotate the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. Tr@@ uman &apos;s consultant and father @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort was involved in the conversation .
right @-@ right on Thursday evening on Thursday evening on Thursday evening , that Mu@@ eller does not show that Mu@@ eller does not live in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of a charge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the en@@ forcement of the new phase was in the investigation and a new reason for president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president on Thursday night used a speech in West Virginia to show Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign to his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic give the demo@@ c@@ rats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feeling good because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a review , he know@@ eth nothing from the en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in sec@@ rec@@ y , he stressed .
the White House endor@@ se any measures which acceler@@ ate the work of the Sonder@@ weg on &quot; fair . &quot;
the former FBI leader James Com@@ ey had said three times that he would not be determined against the President .
they have no reason to say that something changed in it , called it in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this root , repro@@ aches have become no@@ isy , he had to im@@ pe@@ de justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to have a stance against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under big pressure because of the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the Special Repres@@ ent@@ ators and its employees .
the solved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller fled .
unlike an independent special issue of Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Richard Ni@@ xon visits his position , in which he could be fired in theory at the president of the President of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators could not be dismissed on Thursday , after which the Sonder@@ weg should not be dismissed .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tica , a gigantic Eis@@ berg has been replaced by the scar@@ let lake of Berlin almost seven times of Berlin .
this was provided by the Zar@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the large @-@ area of a tr@@ illion ton@@ ne is heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres drive now to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted .
it is with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice gig@@ abytes that have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to man from him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in breaking of the ice@@ berg is un@@ clear according to research .
however , since around 30 years there have been a series of unusual inter@@ ru@@ ptions of ice sk@@ ating in the region , writes the US Research Center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , these can be related to global warming .
the broken colon@@ ies has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swimming in the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow in the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ dung is situated south of South America nearly on the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this cra@@ w@@ mill was the balance of wa@@ xing and canc@@ elling a few years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ spring is broken down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge has never been with@@ drawn as far as currently .
Moreover , the ice plate stands under voltage and could be broken if at a key point a piece ab@@ stain@@ ed .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg will not increase sea level , as they swim in the water and melt the ice as much water as it yields .
however , the loss of the spring goes on that the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , however only in a low degree , writes the UK research project to observe Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest inc@@ ision of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
the transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural look and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ice@@ is now comes into a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; confirmed , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; scientists say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will now rise again or over the long term , and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models said it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers did not lead the crash of this gigantic ice cream on climate change , so many ice sk@@ iers in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have been de@@ but@@ able in recent decades .
this long wave of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends to South America .
according to data from the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the decline have contributed to decline .
in the past 50 years the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have been heated by around three degrees and count in the areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CDU out of pets with staff
because it becomes more difficult to occupy blank areas , the CDU demands the members of the employers association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has got 41 new jobs in the administration .
over 1100 employees and officers work in the management of M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees now have their first working day behind .
the courses in the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
some 620 applicants were to be recorded for this year in for@@ giving places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the circle l@@ acks continued staff to cope with the demands and tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there are currently not occupied points in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
among other things , doctors and engineers are searched for the general management .
the CDU , together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , wants to sei@@ ze the initiative and oppos@@ e it in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is to work according to the wishes of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personnel and personal development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to un@@ cover not only short @-@ term Bed@@ ar@@ fe at specialist skills , but future @-@ oriented towards job scar@@ city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall concept should look inside and out , concrete measures for trans@@ verse frames and an apprentic@@ eship as offensive , call the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems you knew before .
other cities manage good officials and employees and offer attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is by a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease or age @-@ related from the service .
so the highest time to act so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , President of the CDU , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he has long ago already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a fat big surprise , when he publicly posed the personnel covered by the other parties .
nations would like to check all the possibilities that allow withdrawal from the communal worker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here , there should be a union with the unions - maybe even in cooperation with the county @-@ affili@@ ated cities , such as peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means the CDU , to pay the employees and officials to pay better than the tari@@ ff of tari@@ ff for public@@ ity .
the sal@@ aries are currently defined exactly , increases or more money if one changes in a higher level , which is oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are growing more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be furnished in which employees manage to take care of the new pro@@ st@@ itute .
not least by the growing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sp@@ lines the tone to the NGO @-@ migrant @-@ li@@ fe@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has NGOs that use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue their new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German charity organization &apos;@@ youth R@@ ettet &quot; because their crew had worked effectively with traff@@ ic@@ kers in a way that em@@ itting illegal immig@@ ration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself on exec@@ u@@ tives of the Italian authorities Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ op@@ o@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement about the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all acc@@ us@@ ations that are currently le@@ vi@@ ed , only when we collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities covered the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , super@@ vised in October .
it is thought that his crew will start ding@@ h@@ y migrants which can be delivered directly from traff@@ ic@@ kers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go back , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposed to be only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the State of State , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of susp@@ ecting the authority of Italian coast@@ guard , humanitarian motives in the zone of humanitarian motives , and not from any other motives super@@ se@@ ated .
under the code of conduct , boats must be on board like the I@@ u@@ valves , above all , super@@ vised by an Italian police officers .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue inserts have so far been prepared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ nit@@ i said meanwhile , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of migrants who had gone back to Italy in recent weeks is that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast @-@ guards and cooperation with the local mayor &apos;s bud@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citizenship in this month and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ascent and tri@@ als
nine viol@@ er@@ mer bikers , the &quot; Berlin Foreign out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the North pf@@ alz , for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and land@@ marks .
three ordered guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ enheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led with hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
the points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the wooden forest and the out@@ sour@@ ced levels .
in between , there were always longer gra@@ dients , for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , a look@@ out look@@ out to the view@@ point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ age &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
in the last two days many al@@ ti@@ meters were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and h@@ ul@@ ls brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the Bik@@ er are at the open air flow cur@@ ative br@@ ine .
Neustadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters , the group had to know the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from his best side - sporty and cul@@ turally - met .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equi@@ ps for e @-@ sport
in future , the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles , rather than to fight with wind and weather through the stadium of St@@ adi@@ on@@ ras@@ en ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long ago become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative shop - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high season .
this also recognized the first federal law , which increasingly engage in this field .
the beginning of 2015 , V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last@@ ly the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire the new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Managing Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some clubs have to rise in this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; to compete against Gam@@ er &apos;s various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach from Bayer Le@@ ver@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen has now advis@@ es an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year old , that young people may still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one might be more often present on these markets , than once per year , to send to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
while E @-@ Sport are games games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA at the competition level .
long ago , as in normal sport even , they are well established in which the professionals are competing against each other .
and the 2022 World Cup is e @-@ sport already a part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is safe to use .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because he is capable of compet@@ iti@@ vely and many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a spe@@ edy response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train the console , but also exercise their bodies and respect for nutrition .
&quot; the fin@@ ch player is a good player . &quot;
however , fi@@ li@@ ous sees problems : &quot; D@@ oping is becoming increasingly a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult during online play , and in the scene the classical sport were missing .
scientists have emphas@@ ized the high integ@@ rative effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are international , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the consult@@ ancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) is ahead of e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , over 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tour@@ neys .
the turnover in three years is expected to be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga , this is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far away from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
many countries are already continuing .
great markets are Asia and the U.S. , where ex @-@ basketball h@@ oop Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participated in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as subject @-@ subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first @-@ league associations , according to D@@ utt , are obliged to set up an e @-@ sport section .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ged behind Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ President R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nost@@ al@@ gia to exp@@ ire and to clari@@ fy ancient times , today is no longer sufficient .
it is about keeping the association &apos;s tradition , but it also aims to al@@ ign the company on the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; it &apos;s not possible to hold out that only in football everything remains so , as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter about the lyrics that Conrad Roy have been committed suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was sentenced to life in June due to neg@@ ligent death of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the Hear@@ ts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter needed to remain free until his appeal .
she had been confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives had argu@@ ed that both they and Mr Roy had been involved in a mental illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood out with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward , when she was convicted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions were killed by Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the At@@ tor@@ ney at court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , she said .
&quot; she has not shown repent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters Law@@ yer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible revolution that they did not regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or tyre balance or even their cl@@ ergy were a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day when I sei@@ ze the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would like that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I &apos;m trying to carry with us , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy said that she will never be persec@@ uted by knowledge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this one person to have been together with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I am kept for the rest of my life always with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be an legal prec@@ ed@@ ent as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to claim another committed suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the event attracted national attention when Car@@ ters declared text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hän@@ g you , spring of a building , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages sent her to his death in the two weeks before his death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; All that you must do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter searches for the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press from the event .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
to the few , the Carter names , Amanda Knox , who was sentenced to death in 2007 for murder in their British ro@@ omm@@ ate before being acquitted of two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ed at the Audi Cup as a captain , is no co@@ incidence .
FC Bayern saw the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season to compete with extra motivation .
anything was different from his place in the cabin , that was Joshua K@@ imm@@ i once immediately , even if the extra garments became very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups there was no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer to see how he made it to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the conven@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the entrance could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the Coach could also explain K@@ imm@@ ing this way too .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen from youth fiction , de@@ but@@ ants , and just from the holiday commented pros existing C @-@ El@@ f has been chosen as a player , but he .
su@@ gar@@ ine is mainly distributed to those who want to sav@@ our a lot , which you want to hold with wh@@ im .
so who has chosen L@@ ame , the h@@ eir of Lah@@ m , a small extra motivation can only use well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : assume responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ l@@ ame on the field .
right back , that is now his position , the white in@@ ders on the arm did its rest .
and at all I worked in this start@@ up information such as the one that can also take the rest in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ split tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy himself .
Vid@@ al thus to over@@ play its lack of fitness ( foldable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out to the services of Asia @-@ travel ( folding also only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ls make no negative effect in their first gig in Bavaria @-@ tri@@ cot .
all this worked very well .
Sü@@ ls ran next to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense , both were so@@ vereign .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ storm often opened many times , in addition , Sü@@ ls tried to test a couple of times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave to that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wasn &apos;t that the same as we have been hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
game shift , speed change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new@@ com@@ ers , one saw the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but surely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i passed after a few cr@@ un@@ y say@@ ings in his back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on , I &apos;ve already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Bavaria , you have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one .
Al@@ aba highly motivated by est@@ FB women
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ FB ladies

companies are pleased with rh@@ et@@ land @-@ bran@@ ded minister : business engaged with She@@ chem
it was often im@@ plac@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate was .
this is reflected in the office for more than one year , in which the new business Minister Volker She@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and enterprises of the region speak to T V @-@ en@@ quiry of a change in economic policy - and ad@@ mitt@@ edly the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , President of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; She@@ ing attacks the desires of the economy that has blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot;
Nat@@ us &apos;s greatest revers@@ al sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ er@@ pillar of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the priority list of the country .
even this year the Ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 shall be the building right .
a role in the plans of the country also plays in Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal national map .
the aim is to take into operation the stretch in December 2020 , says the Minister Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign to support regional , international competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) is supported by She@@ ing , as the wine is a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , She@@ ing also opened an open ear for people who want to establish an own company , the I@@ HK .
the Trier crafts@@ manship sees an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
this is intended to be a premium of 1000 Euro for the ste@@ ady master testing and 2,500 euros , when al@@ um@@ ni will be self @-@ employed within ten years after the master@@ piece .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
on the planned road construction , quick facts are to create , at the same time it is the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , main business leader of the HK Trier .
so far 29 places have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wants to set up mobility at the local company .
the HK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CDU faction Christian Bald@@ auf refers to the calculations of the Court of Audit@@ ors , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of provincial roads .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects to solve the country &apos;s concept as it wants to solve the cra@@ ft@@ manship in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing was furthermore the existing broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey just 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about ov@@ ing Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke currently is out of politics and is still sitting on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become a president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she had already cleared the field after four months of in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi is designed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter response
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW @-@ chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is intelligent options as a constra@@ int , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there@@ on , referring to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based on diesel vehicles to ban or re@@ tren@@ ch diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support respect of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxide , which em@@ its diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , equipment to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases of diesel vehicles , take also what it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the mighty car companies and ignore the problems of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation devices to comply with requirements when a car has been tested , but normal driving conditions .
several employees were indicted by Volkswagen in the United States , others will be resear@@ ched on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be placed in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations , after the authorities accused of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could load Volkswagen seriously : the luxury car manufacturer is currently disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to the Volkswagen win .
this message has the raft on Saturday in the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar visitors also participate , a raft of Saturday will go through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
if it goes on Saturday again to the Is@@ ar , there will be a big raft at there between Fl@@ au@@ cher and Reich@@ enb@@ ach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the reference wants to clari@@ fy .
on the raft you can see a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ ate .
it shows a waste dump .
the start to a public@@ ity campaign to app@@ end to the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love &quot; ... the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to sharp@@ ening as a protective wilderness .
even last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a reck@@ ful and environmentally @-@ conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ igh@@ s @-@ rab@@ bits and the laughter of the suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo served to be one of the most @-@ published cartoon animation , the rab@@ bits of his pieces are his trademark .
with 85 the Argentin@@ ian is also awarded and works in a film .
his message : &quot; laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he gar@@ n@@ ered among others as a sign for congrat@@ ulation . what fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60 &apos;s breakthrough : the publication of his cart@@ oons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then also in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
and again , the artists of the cities were inspired .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures cav@@ orting in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he still sits on the subject , even today at the animation , almost ten hours a day .
over calendar , puzzles , books for large and small , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and clo@@ cks continue to find its threatened pieces worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon animation and TV series for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main people in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ ers in his drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ al chan@@ ger as a counter @-@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie to enter the cinema screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they are saying , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather sets off on the TV @-@ series , which is produced by its original drawings .
lav@@ ender threatened by Provence from climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
lav@@ ender is falling because of the in@@ fusion of d@@ rought and due to the diseases aff@@ ecting insects , what scientists and farmers try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which resulted in much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade which transfers a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it &apos;s much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil goes not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
regarding the solutions that are considered , a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry conditions .

the murder of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Weekly R@@ odo@@ ce meet usually on Wednesday to review their plans for the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa , organized by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ceas@@ ing drug control .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two highly challenging journalists will discuss what feels safe : they are supposed to take their children with the office which were 2009 the target of a attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or at home .
security experts have written three words onto a table on the front of the room : enemies , neutral , allies .
they ask the Rep@@ orter , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal pain .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ el , a catalog of bre@@ aches that make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no rest from violence , and during the whole country , there are more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto entered into office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 , after attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection , there were at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter is their publisher and inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to be living in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in the context of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply recep@@ tive , even though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , that shows its middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , that are his ri@@ di@@ culous face with glasses or typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although the At@@ tor@@ ney General has been erected in 2010 , to edit the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee to protect journalists .
as in most thousands of murder , each year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime are linked , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely judged on trial .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they are still standing on treated to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , though it is un@@ consol@@ able , though the terrain is still av@@ ail@@ l@@ astic yet .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without righteousness , the meeting on discussion of safety is little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we are susp@@ icious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to take a few blocks far away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was arrested by two men . he was forced from his car and was shot for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ der River . &quot;
the guns went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to go freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is virtually nothing but silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the United States last year and extra@@ dition in the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa has become one of the country &apos;s blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in order to fight the vacuum . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ al@@ oa every day someone or more people will be shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of mut@@ ually , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug purposes , which are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only one cart@@ el has control over the coastal state , with its precious har@@ bours and drugs trading routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez is aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the debt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings have contributed to murder .
in February , there was a publication of a interviews with a gar@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader among the ri@@ val cart@@ ography in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may upset the children , though the crew purchased every copy of the issue as soon as she was extra@@ d@@ ited to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to force a newspaper , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , the country has to leave its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a landmark in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues might im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he worked as experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined with five colleagues to the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate from journ@@ alism without having to stum@@ ble on the f@@ ake ven@@ om problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time , the paper also earned a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and sales and advertising revenue .
repor@@ ters love to publish hard @-@ proof tests without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories not to treat them anything else .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Preis &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists to protect journalists from the prosecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever he was .
he gave himself up voluntarily to fear .
&quot; I would like to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J @-@ Award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said a way of life in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ p@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you must take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either you or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird that was like a do@@ ck@@ worker , who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice was a teacher that knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there on the same table .
now ask them : was his love for routine to become routine ?
his death , too , has also comp@@ elled to ask her own ideas about how she can do their work on the best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home and landing run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cen@@ sored and self @-@ maintaining .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells false , just stay away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then it happened to Javier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ al@@ oa not more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ hi@@ ves , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before , it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , used to super@@ v@@ ise journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a central area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who described the governor themselves as un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it &apos;s months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug members are de fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blown up three main histor@@ ies .
it gave the assass@@ ination of the brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had a ex@@ pos@@ é about state spending , which was concentrated on the home town &apos;s home town .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the district attorney , kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was charged when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that restaurant is a favorite locally of drug ad@@ diction and authorities .
a repor@@ ter ran out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the gover@@ ning Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) that ruled almost all the century all political levels .
several pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors were accused of corruption due to high @-@ performance corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this local restaurant including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went away from military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier the readers had watched the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier we had knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; due to its sl@@ ender body nature .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers that are protest@@ ing against the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something that they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
Rep@@ orter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez schn@@ app@@ ended a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist at the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared for three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mic@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists have become stronger in all the country by writing them in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on grounds and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to medi@@ ate journalists and destroy them , because they have said the truth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has therefore requested that she is rep@@ ain@@ ted by the government , because she is worried that her anger has hurt their objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez again said that journalists in Mexico were organized by organised crime , involved government officials and a local society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug abuse , but also on orders of politicians and security forces that cont@@ acted with organized crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on repor@@ ters and officers in the past year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you will die because they want you to feel the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody e@@ ats the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note that allegedly signed by the Su@@ etas de Kartell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones beside their separate head .
some Fili@@ ps have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how El Man@@ ana von Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the D@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly ge@@ ared up the batt@@ le@@ es with an editorial on the front@@ page with the heading &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled from their native countries or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and still watching the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased how it seems to be on the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue back and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , is that the drug trade is fri@@ ghtened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to h@@ um .
a number of shooting branches with rib@@ bed v@@ als and security forces near the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a series of Kartell @-@ messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ stone can@@ ons they published the latest news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce over mobile phone .
the introduction had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police , who stopped the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the gigantic portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ al@@ oa , the crew of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was murdered on the same day when Javier was murdered , she asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used clo@@ ak to soak his enemies
on the first glance , it looks like a statue , although a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the unbelievable nas@@ cent of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even determine that his shoe was killed by red@@ dish Braun - and they said she could have had something from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rec@@ alled dinosau@@ rs , the ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ r copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , that lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well experienced state , researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable , &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res is the best known fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ en@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray , north of Alberta , Canada , green .
he met something that sh@@ out from the surrounding rock at the plat@@ eau , and decided to watch more closely .
the F@@ ossil was sent by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy gro@@ unding .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only do a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved dinosau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this herb car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and re@@ sem@@ bling a changing tanks , probably threatened by meat @-@ co@@ res dinosau@@ rs .
the highly ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from prey , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute technology used as counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to isol@@ ate himself better in its surroundings and say to his enemies , experts say that it was threatened by bigger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it , to carefully cover it .
the amazing maintenance of specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of sheds and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ trans@@ lat@@ ation , a widespread defence method in animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark than its under@@ side .
although the console is usual , the results are surprisingly , since the size of Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals survi@@ ving the animals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it pointed out that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by the meat @-@ res dinosau@@ rs , that the evolution of exposure of the confron@@ tation was regarded as means of survi@@ ving survival . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but most of the contemporary animals that use the console - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or gir@@ d@@ les - are much smaller and hurt as lo@@ ot , what sign@@ aling that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , highly ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs have been the cra@@ yon of the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on his life , including his pre@@ serv@@ ated Dar@@ min@@ ent , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , had passed into a river and thrown into the sea , where he sun@@ k on the back to the sea floor .
at that time Alberta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ serv@@ icing skin , but has also been preserved in three dimensions and the original form of the animal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost like in the early cra@@ yon time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when gigantic fer@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ r , which stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs was driven by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
about this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tonnes heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned after death in the sea and conf@@ is@@ cated in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ en@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray , north of Alberta , Canada , green .
according to the museum it is the ne@@ ung@@ ed dinosau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .

in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on the A8 : many injured
today &apos;s accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , mile @-@ long star@@ ters - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon , approximately 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ act .
according to the police , the police were at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the Gi@@ fts Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , which is probably also trucks connecting them .
the exact number of injured taxes first appeared initially .
it handle from light to moderate injury , a polic@@ eman said .
a great array of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long tail was formed .
like a AZ Rep@@ orter , it also came to massive disability too - caused by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade is marked by the labels of the vehicle tan@@ kers , who now have to reck@@ on with delicate stra@@ ins .
shortly after 18 : 45 pm there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car transport and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group tested &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is amaz@@ ingly sitting on the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
the conductor comes and raises an un@@ smooth or inc@@ is@@ ses the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
chassis control .
but the times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions are over .
the German rail@@ ways are the best @-@ made ticket inspection .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that is taken in its place and therefore dev@@ alu@@ ed the ticket .
at present , a test run is run on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , we expand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in many more remote routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the ticket price without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use them , however , some conditions have to be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what do most passengers do anyway .
you have to also have bought it via the app , the DB Navigator software , which is the most convenient way of ticket .
and last you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customer then a button for electronic evaluation will then appear .
the train@@ ers received a message to their mobile devices that the g@@ ast X is located in the train and taken the seat of the seat Y .
the train@@ ers of the ticket inspection at room Y do he knows that there is a passenger with already dispos@@ ed online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on , keep on silence .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which will take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; who wants to travel without ticket control through our train services , check in the DB Navigator by yourself .
this allows passengers to create their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing executive board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who rides a train , knows that next to the delay and missing turns the ticket controls are among the biggest nu@@ ances .
because often , in any case , one of the passengers do not require any documents that you need to use online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or a document you have to refer .
the result are endless discussions between train companion and passenger , which leads to worse sen@@ timent in part or major and del@@ ays in control of their own tickets and take the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not available yet .
like an activ@@ ist , the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to their core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis , sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled upon a post from somebody from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it still lies on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly exposed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper of St. Louis was killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old man who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live at twe@@ ets .
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched on the road and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is a wild , &quot; said Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she used her mobile phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was photos of police band and people who cried out , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another polic@@ eman secured his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell refers to their asser@@ tion .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have grown acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and we can call it typical . &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home next day .
after landing at 23 : 00 she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in the next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss power that exists from the point of view of men who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who rode a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , that they had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know it and they will see and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if I have the happiness to experience their experience , in which they personally experience no ec@@ z@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black women child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling that I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which was on a camp@@ ground when the activists on the possible non @-@ indictment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson waited .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined a local business partner , lunch .
they prepare pockets before and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m began to embrace fer@@ m shape .
&quot; my ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said , &quot; she said she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority student N@@ Course Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in the organis@@ er .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document only &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless instances of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as follows , in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised her votes and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field which is known for its ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ de@@ fir@@ kt .
his commitment brought closer to the project , along with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talk to us . we speak , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for so will I be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim was not to focus on he@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ essi@@ ah leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participants in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life as they &apos;re in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and with the realization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media in 2012 , identi@@ fies the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must carry the main load of all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really kept upright by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ist type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the movie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person that sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , though it was on fore@@ front , because in a life at these jun@@ ctions than a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway with a demonstration .
it describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area , which it calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
yet they c@@ lung to a chant and she feels committed to this memory , since then she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; Range of meg@@ al@@ ahn &quot; : TV reader discuss bit gallery
the bit Gallery is moving people , although they are not yet built .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone divi@@ des the population of advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold , the subject is hardly any cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one added to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schröder ) , or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole races ) , from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need any human &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi otok ) , or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the advoc@@ ates make that a Gallery draws more customers to the city , of which the other shops benefit , fear the opponents , that the pedestrian prec@@ urs@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
added : the gallery is planned right on the property , on which the farmers market stands , in which 13 direct investments will offer their products .
the construction work will be concluded with the start of construction .
gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - as a Bed@@ a place with the possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the farm market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ma@@ ids are always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is too .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct distribut@@ ors to the gallery in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent .
it should probably not be low with the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping bags in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , foot@@ wear , dro@@ pping or supermarkets : I find it unnecessary .
there is enough of them in our city .
you see how many shops are vac@@ ated here - some since months and years .
however , since there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mainly offered by producers and is also very inexpensive .
as you see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies because the rentals are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special stores exist almost no more and what is left of it will probably even disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market stand during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in duration , if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or creates the g@@ hosts bit gallery before going to ban@@ ish all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work simply .
and a shopping center that stands empty , nobody needs .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but thanks to phant@@ astic construction , there is no space for a pe@@ asant market in many - like me - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
when the pe@@ asant market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ers DNA
in the center of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ mistak@@ able - hang it on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts created by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former Secret service analy@@ st was a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being publicly connected to diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years Cor@@ respon@@ dence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has been transformed into technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a Trans@@ woman and Dis@@ sident Dis@@ si@@ dent@@ in , whose convic@@ tion was later than three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could look extracted from the 30 portraits , such as someone can be interpreted by these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born in Brad@@ ley Edward since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was said openly about the identification as a woman , in 2013 he was convicted of 20 charges , including six injuries against the act of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her image was op@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ce@@ ful , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning deliber@@ ately sits on a driver and a plat@@ inum blonde per@@ cent@@ red - which it was associated with them .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it the artist portraits of strangers in for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette and che@@ wing gum extracted from the waste to make a picture of it , as these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an E @-@ Mail from an newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not attend this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and their imprisoned m@@ use were w@@ ai@@ ded to un@@ equal letters , which inter@@ ventions several letters during the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a Comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ lied Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ un@@ o , who predicted a future in which he would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ i &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little depth and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against trans@@ forming troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways , in order to remove the rigid divisions which he actually got to get further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one of the gallery of the gallery called M@@ anning with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic breakdown , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , written in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hop@@ ed to show the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , like surprisingly similar , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully take part , is that our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work is from 2007 to see Tra@@ ious Mem@@ ories .
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece of the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the Comic @-@ Nov@@ elle above .
she shows M@@ anning , as she emerges from the United States , the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they ch@@ ill your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , gre@@ ets of Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ ose bum@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
M@@ anning hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was fore@@ seen in the comic book - but when it was supposed to do , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ak@@ ras that collapse like hor@@ des of protest .
this was also aimed at how everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , man@@ ings st@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ signs were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her to the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed along with Chelsea , like the movement , even behind her deliver@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University because of murder
a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff at Oxford University , who had been sought for a susp@@ ect , after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ ts for murder because of its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as shown in the Municipal Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a general war@@ d@@ ative warning system was published by the Chicago Police Department , that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim of several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared on the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective examine the stit@@ ches as a murder while the police are active after the two susp@@ ects , they said to officials .
L@@ ath@@ em has been Professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relationships , said in an e @-@ mail explanation , L@@ ath@@ em was now put in detention and exp@@ elled from the presence of the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal issue examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to help us investig@@ ate US investig@@ ative authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the testimony added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and wanted that he himself had .
chief Communications Officer of the police department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of her where@@ ab@@ ort , and our efforts to locate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building who had just received a mysterious tip that was something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel treatment .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published a statement on the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the Tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will shut down the WA@@ DA timet@@ able in the near future , &quot; Russian Vice @-@ Ver@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russian Vice @-@ He@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ doping agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA schedule was updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commenting on the second part of the schedule of the WA@@ DA to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the implementation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko he contains nothing that could cause an event for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list is , however , that the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities approved the reported results issued by the WA@@ DA by Canadian attorney Richard McLaren to publicly accept religious d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ doping system has collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no government programs , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with Russian sales site R@@ Sport on the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v caused problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organizations , but then added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one has to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ on@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
in November 2015 R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in Russia as part of D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the execution of doping control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate the tests under supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit by the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Niger , declar@@ es that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be deployed .
Al@@ di hasn &apos;t sold any eggs anymore
this shared the company groups .
it is an imp@@ ure measure , but could not be prec@@ eded by any health objec@@ tion@@ ment , called it in the message .
only eggs must be delivered to Al@@ di only , which have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative to fi@@ pron@@ oun@@ saturated anti @-@ lung cancer .
Al@@ di would therefore produce clarity and transparency at its customers .
the start @-@ ups which will help your company will not be becoming the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the pol@@ ls do not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not dare this process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consist@@ ency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company and Madison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it called people from outside to help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies finding out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee @-@ commitment , it allows companies to access personnel , social groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , allowing C @-@ Suite exec@@ u@@ tives , and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you have now tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used by companies to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ pol@@ ls and pol@@ ls of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows what units have most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives have low access results - so you can ref@@ illed , why .
companies come to know that at the top of the workplace culture , so you can &apos;t go to the next U@@ ber , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee has published a blog post , which describes a environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , with those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .
global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance branch could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , according to the financed technical website : let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of this year in Mis@@ k@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Company will send tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pul@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pol@@ ls , confi@@ dential responses in real time and watch the warmth cards of your problem area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line where employees can report bad behavior .
and when the principal executive is included , complaints direct to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has listed the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his employees are badly handled or un@@ ethical , there can be expensive consequences through consumer bo@@ yc@@ ott , worker @-@ fluctu@@ ation and complaints , &quot; said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Conver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures , and a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he needed to find a formal complaint or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ able and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to trace the complaints of employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , since the company conver@@ ge , you can have problems that were previously hidden in offices in cities or countries , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lau@@ er inter@@ ns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to these holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view across the experience dealing with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to appo@@ int Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ics , and Emplo@@ ye@@ es in 2002 after the accounting firm , Arthur Ander@@ sen , collap@@ sed because of the Enron sc@@ andal , said the Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and load the company with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find approval by Venture Capital investors , both start@@ ups supported .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding from companies such as Sap@@ phire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
over $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners claimed all its funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than expected from their jobs .
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company , and that the work you are doing is worth it , and they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are working and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools say third , commitment and commitment to the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts in workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless , if the company does not take action .
in fact , when a company is asking for your feedback , it may have anticip@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come quickly enough , or at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees can counter@@ act .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very much on collecting data .
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , you &apos;re wonder@@ ing , &quot; Did you really hear me ?
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t take care of , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who is now monthly assist@@ ing surveys , was able to initi@@ ate action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so is saving .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize and manage multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company always has new insights over the staff , and it hopes that in a long term , this leads to better engagement of workers in a industry which is well known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose humans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose humans , you may lose client too .
and if you lose client , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it runs at 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tained himself on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot kern@@ els and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of this team , these empty minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise after their final test , before they return next morning at 6 : 30 p.m. to water football center .
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real Tre@@ vor mill , &quot; said Bru@@ t @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
that is why the first three training sessions at U@@ CL@@ A were starting at 19 : 15 pm to meet the already full @-@ packed schedule of players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day , at which the brood @-@ ins were post@@ pon@@ ed almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time at Mor@@ as &apos;s six gaming times performed in Western wood exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . 20 before beginning of the formal pre @-@ preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of the N@@ CAA , even if they want to add a further point to the multiple routes of the player .
&quot; we lay these enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just re@@ pressed , they break out , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to the Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will termin@@ ate their practices , as soon as the Camp ends its fields of its fields of a adjacent parking place and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the top class which has already been rejected with foot@@ balls , which will be no easy task .
brood @-@ Player should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that it might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people are interested there a room and then set there to set up an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video of an exercise , it &apos;s a quite good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I &apos;m not very worried about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false alerts about third parties and their results , under the original entry , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods and send them to the fact that may display the results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ized as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , of which many believe that they also have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political theme in Europe , although the French voters were floo@@ ded in May with false stories in May with false stories , and Germany will not support a plan to eliminate the social media networks like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the U.S. , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts audit will be launched .
&quot; apart from the realization that the stories of fact checked the third parties , people want more context to make good decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product man@@ ag@@ erin for fac@@ ebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conjunction with the item &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Comic @-@ ROM : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat at Be@@ w@@ l River valley in Kent , and is now to inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of somebody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ ari@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sc@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , forth@@ coming British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b print on the page of a letter which was written by a double agents in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters cra@@ w@@ l on the smoke , as at that time , a fire was kind@@ led because of light .
for anyone who lives 300 years later , the smell as a result he would also be there .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for anyone who is so busy with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have a bit over@@ rated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) this seems to be nice to be true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures of the castle , such as the mon@@ mented hy@@ gro@@ ves on the walls and bottles that have spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he moves through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapes , gar@@ dening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive which he said as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , cards that show what had said : &quot; one could mean that land conflicts become boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch that fought for two families .
guys , let all go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to look at a wider base in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which leaves the newly built castle to join the pe@@ asant ris@@ ky of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il which occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &quot; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Family of Kent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farm started in this area and I thought , a rebel@@ lion is a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are connected to each other ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &quot; The Pri@@ est &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ ite for seven years during the English re@@ formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the mu@@ g@@ gl@@ man Arthur Dar@@ rell described in the 18th century by adding a sar@@ g with stones ( a dis@@ covering that was first made later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the actors are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen appeared to be quite a G@@ aun@@ er , and spending money back and money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men dissolved their school crises by giving rich old women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap of good looking guys , with a talent to promote inheritance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des in search of other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ sh@@ ame@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the area of a San@@ atorium from the early 20th century that has been demanded from nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be ready again with that dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : covered over 300 years old Mari@@ ental &apos;s in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ ental &apos;s in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to launch a new roof brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team by Nelson Art@@ z want to keep the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August , there should be a feast on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th at the end of August .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their last page yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make sure that some things are better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm belief that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens around the beauty and attrac@@ tiv@@ eness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise , one that gives the city a distinctive sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally they are standing in competition with other municip@@ alities .
the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f leaves the new umbrella brand and the campaign cost an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear in front of the army
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on retirement schem@@ es and subsi@@ dies within the officer cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so this week too .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff , as earlier , but in the office of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the consultations under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five European Parliament also participated , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ number .
the government left the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were ab@@ sent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the failed Cou@@ p , President Erdoğan has fired the 326 gener@@ als and Admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erdogan as a dragon .
for 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly in the attempt at the coup attempt , is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the crash test as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he had the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are evidence of an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army which manifest@@ ed among others in the abol@@ ition of the head@@ scarf ban for solo@@ ists , wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big cleaner in the army and security forces continued in any case .
in the middle of July Erdogan acted as a decree for another 73@@ 95 coup , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed like Erdogan was ste@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly known as the actual gent@@ lemen of the country .
three times they released their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly rule of state .
following his election victory 2002 , Erdogan urged the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to reform proposed by the European Union .
former officers say that Erdogan is driven by Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who sought asylum from persecution in persecution against persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not meet , that this development could not be cold .
anyway , in the Alliance for the pur@@ ges , there is dou@@ bts about the work of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leadership structures and oper@@ ation@@ als are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new US immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looks to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , str@@ ingent regulations for the vis@@ itation of vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and by the President .
the bill will be deb@@ ated in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise the wages and savings of billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the U.S. to be issued by citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will avoid the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit from our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months over the future of the race section sh@@ utt@@ les had been disputed - now it is supposed to be very fast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the end of the year , the trail is expected to be built on which the tourist rail@@ ways will be built .
in order to ensure the future of the race gra@@ dient , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is expected to begin on the track this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order the circuit Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g to order and to renov@@ ate , the country knows this especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said public state Secretary Klaus Sü@@ hl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the distance covered it to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the land exceeds 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered from the country , defin@@ iti@@ vely voted , stated Sü@@ hl .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen rail as an operator are already unanim@@ ous about technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the timet@@ able that is negoti@@ ated by the vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sü@@ hl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race track shuttle will be purchased on December 2017 .
the racing track Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the train stations Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the past months , a pilot project had been tested , if the route is used sufficiently many people to order them again in the future .
the circuit is also strongly b@@ ob@@ ble in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
just as you thought it could not be a crazy party in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Stiftung für Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published an account of the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to begin to take their asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies offer any amount of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ ires have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots which feel warm and feel warm - with consci@@ ously human reactions which are achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust its robot according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is still wor@@ sen@@ ing , as many robots possess &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would be progressive with a step@@ per woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ ires have developed to robots using a silicone cone .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example , to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they look appe@@ aling such as a student .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; giving the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ness and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
during the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
it can be tired , fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects on this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships - but the sub@@ jec@@ tions on ra@@ pe , if one goes a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah goes , dis@@ rup@@ ted one of the most .
on his website true True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , then why can men do not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just another sex drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and low in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a wish for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most men will naturally do not have sex robots , while the FR@@ R notice their increasing popularity , they still remain in the outskirts of the consumer culture .
but what sick@@ le out of the bound@@ ary , can be in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very educational .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or ins@@ ulting , until the free market is given permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that this highly @-@ developed sex @-@ robot appear in a time that the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which the White House has inv@@ aded a president that has promised to have women sexually transmitted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most awesome aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that are eng@@ ul@@ fed your body and cast eyes , but how realistic that vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment , this does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these Sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even though por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their gro@@ ves want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; robots represent no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can &apos;t separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no clu@@ e or background history , nothing that indicates independence or something that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are f@@ ake slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ emer of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney become the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human being
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become an ad@@ diction in the ump @-@ era that the political activ@@ ations , which have polar@@ isation of US voters , also have split families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Than@@ ksgiving was in the USA newspapers with advice about how to cope with the hor@@ ror of mut@@ ump choosing relatives .
we are all supposed to open ourselves to our filter bubbles .
less noticeable is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famili@@ es together .
I will mention this because my c@@ ousin , a centre @-@ left poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , who visited this week in New York .
she rem@@ inded me that the unit might have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone knows it , including rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , who had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very strange at the same side .
to the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls in another context that this also brings significant risks .
the Left Opposition was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the deci@@ ding effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that we will no longer be able to stum@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is still a fri@@ ght@@ ful long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly appear to appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of conc@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , I find myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the dec@@ ay - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which looked at the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both occur in fact a very mild off@@ ence .
if Tr@@ ump happens , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spiritual to qualify for an im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city , if there is no caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are no@@ isy and the animals are turning to look full of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ iting music gives it a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disappo@@ int : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not satisfy the dream .
five and five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not quite a Swiss cottage - the topic pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a great roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as here two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and all have a great time .
if I had the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked about that .
on the other hand , I was comp@@ elled to assess my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in coffee at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to compens@@ ate an average of 15 % tip - this to buy something about buying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange but also pres@@ sur@@ ing pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation , in which no one is required . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ etic , while I we@@ ary the experience I made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to the hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten , according to his cell authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after an appeal against the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed ste@@ ep@@ y in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night penetration that hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to put this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they be too op@@ a@@ que .
the National Prosecutor requested that it would be denied by the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year .
pist@@ ori@@ us runs into danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a curious egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the Four@@ t@@ ens@@ ler from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dismissed into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to college , four of school students .
on Tuesday evening , Schul@@ er Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental mayor in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes were elected by the pupils of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young e@@ agle that grows in chick@@ ens , but then freed in freedom .
in addition , the m@@ lower Sh@@ ar carried a musical with the title &quot; The Adler in the chicken farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a curious egg , and left it from his chick@@ ens .
a little e@@ agle came instead of one chicken .
but the hope of coming from him a chicken , the eag@@ les spread his wings on a high mountain , and escaped .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders carrying the bet .
the Eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ duc@@ er Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young was different from other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished to see every quarter that he feels in his new school .
it was thanks to than@@ ksgiving to the colleagues to the former school director Michael Müller , who will always jump back with teaching ban@@ anas and her parents .
the co@@ king was now over , class Sophia Schumacher explained .
she leave her students after two years of instruction only very much , because it was a really great time .
finally , it was able to leave for the four da@@ zz@@ lers .
for the conclusion , all students will res@@ ound a song from summer time and holiday periods .
there was great joy in the children .
eight original shr@@ ink@@ ers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was quoted from television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while currently underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians have been released later .
the Greek authorities have grav@@ ated control over the free camp and lie everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial gains .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the subject now need to know
how exactly is the software update instead ?
need diesel drivers participate in the action ?
overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the Diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group has offered software updates for some 5.3 million cars .
you should improve the emission behaviour of cars from the emission value of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anine of ACE Auto Club Europe provides in@@ estim@@ ations :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the updated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are valid for the vehicles taking the Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting is arranged to the Federal Chanc@@ ell@@ ation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but still has no exact date .
Daimler informed us to write any of the suff@@ er@@ ers .
if anyway an inspection is supposed , it will be done in their frame .
how long will the retro@@ fit come up ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the hang@@ s from the commitment of the manufacturer and from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen such a voluntary work , the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
the time @-@ consuming might be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that have no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will be waiting for .
probably foreign manufacturers would trace , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive price reduction of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but , in the regions , where cycling is threat@@ ening .
in rural areas there is no value losses for older diesel so far .
the ACE is advis@@ able to maintain with a sale .
ll Cool J Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ am@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving of President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first R@@ apper be one of the cov@@ eted awards for the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution was announced on Thursday , singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) were respected .
the awards will be handed over to the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the Le@@ ar progressive TV series announced that this is why we have already announced the gala &apos;s participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even the means to avoid them - and that weighs me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make up their visibility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy centre , which was named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ as Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city lively
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into pension in the coming year .
the location is already written - adequate applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been in town for 31 years .
and the work always gives him great fun , as it convey@@ ed in the press talks .
he reports from diversi@@ fied , but also challenging tasks , waiting for his successor .
at the same time , no bid had been ful@@ filling the requirements profile .
the city seeks an architect or construction engineer at the nearest time .
thus - under regard of the regular dis@@ mis@@ sal - still enough time for a re@@ el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach joined the administrative community as a sub @-@ contrac@@ tor , applicants must refer to the relevant financial statements .
for this function will definitely keep the city .
if they could not fill this one more , the citizens would have to travel to Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the city close to the city and himself is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker that reports from a good enterprise and good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years of office , some important projects are accumulated , looking back to W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the company &apos;s office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Dutch parking lot are about to be pushed .
the Kin@@ ties Bridge Between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike at around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design for design is present for a town building master .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construction yard and gar@@ dening can be re@@ acted quite flexi@@ bly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the creation of the green spaces , will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the old town is known as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Monument protection &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is important to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an eye on what it fits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Neu@@ bauten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lines the schei@@ d Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , the town Bu@@ ilder has high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a support and coordination , he can count on many long @-@ standing employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with us for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Lower bau ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , his successor became long , W@@ acker wishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We seek someone who really identi@@ fies and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for continu@@ ity , continu@@ ity is not only important for a good enterprise , but also for the further design of the city .
after the information of the city of Has@@ lach , who wants to have completed his studies as a diploma for civil engineering or Bachelor with special academic studies , should have good knowledge in the fields of construction and building planning .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ haus under@@ stands high @-@ quality and deep @-@ building , building planning , management of urban lovers , municipal farm with building yard and city gar@@ dening and sub @-@ building authority including monument protection .
tos@@ sed on the lines : closed south@@ ward route
according to police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had been the blue bicycle from the track track in the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so severely damaged that the her@@ al@@ ende freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators are going out of two male animals and search for them since the night hours .
close to the scene a ros@@ ist rolling and a bike driver had been observed near the scene .
&quot; this goes far beyond a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat , &quot; said Ö@@ BB &apos;s spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch said to AP@@ A .
the perpet@@ rators were in danger even in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility and the delay and the cost of rail traffic , also P@@ ön@@ alen transfers could also appear to the perpet@@ rators .
overall , speaking of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , the speaker said .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south@@ side route could be guided without disabilities .
almost ten persons were unusual , two of them concerned the correspondence .
goods are not inv@@ aded , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB &apos;s spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 yards of out@@ lines .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to ease IB@@ D ( inflamm@@ atory represent@@ ations )
red meat and chocolate can sound perfect for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of patients with inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States , causes gast@@ cl@@ amps and blo@@ ws , recur@@ ring or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those that are usually advised to alle@@ vi@@ ate flesh and dairy products found researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins contributes to develop immune cells , which promote an toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the executive expl@@ orer , Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that are hidden in the food , do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are able to trigger infections are offset by cells , protecting the tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive fabric .
when the balance is too far in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it can result in an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory intest@@ inal disease .
in experiments that a type of tolerance subsi@@ dy immune cell comes in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in its inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oma , and developing a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had of these imm@@ unity . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an diet toler@@ ated , less inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel diseases , if the same system works in humans .
the Post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of students had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , which was not separated .
it is thought that the difference had to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses , and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were missing in a ster@@ ile environment , so they did not develop a bo@@ wel micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers removed L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ate the toler@@ ant conveyor cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the lining of mice , the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent , but the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant conveyor @-@ giving cells like mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us from our stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
it is not known if Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i found the cells at men such as in mice but defects in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells are controlling inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially may lead high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of these population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; Genie . &quot;
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; ; Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pounds signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressed with the Hal@@ ter role as people mar@@ ched as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira as desired .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; it takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent revealed in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wished for three additional new under@@ tak@@ ings , but he in@@ sist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fulfil three of its four main comm@@ it@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot;

new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , President of the SPD head , was a prime minister of prime minister of elections ahead of elections with some concern to Berlin .
only no distur@@ b@@ fire from the party central , merely no other wind from the Bund - so the most important desire of the election campaign .
since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed pro@@ found@@ ly .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing determin@@ ing the events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ning state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has been given from there since the beginning of the year , would not have been described by a counter@@ wind .
there were pit@@ falls .
and one after another .
the Federal CDU , after the aston@@ ishing end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , sees a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and Green Party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising question of quest@@ ionn@@ aire by the Gre@@ ens M@@ EPs took the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months prior to the country election , its red @-@ green coalition lost their vote majority to the opposition of the CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Business Administration Michael Kell@@ ner asked to give back its mandate back to the Gre@@ ens Green Party .
the survi@@ vor of the CDU is a clear for@@ gery of the worker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return to her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German business leader and elec@@ toral campaign of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not all be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sigh@@ s an SPD elec@@ toral campaign than on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , President of the SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony is after the survi@@ ving of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of the CDU to the CDU without their own government majority .
it is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no longer , the comra@@ des s@@ ooth@@ ed down .
everything will be different after the federal elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
this was then also - and everything was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ meln , the Dus@@ seldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite party felt smooth .
the comra@@ des reported to meet the comra@@ des in the weeks afterwards .
when she had just had a new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and the next fall came with him .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his aura at that weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burnt .
and because he did something wrong in the crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for political survival .
so also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ gas aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the lower sax@@ onian Prime Minister had already been in the cr@@ iti@@ que for some time .
several surveys were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps , because in the past weeks , because in the past weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ ents in the covenant .
the amb@@ ition of the former mayor of Hannover to expand its power in Berlin , was also not conc@@ e@@ aled in Martin Schulz as well .
they left him , as they promised by Weil a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
thus , because in the part@@ isan horn , the lower Sax@@ on Green is basically no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz is not at all .
sometimes , the comra@@ des ende@@ av@@ ours to keep the own ranks closed .
her anger rests upon the green , and here especially on the revol@@ ving parliamentary group in T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cr@@ ative purposes , such as Mrs. T@@ eth her own care@@ ers on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party in the SPD parliamentary report , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests is not elected for their person as direct can@@ did@@ dat@@ in , but on the country list of the lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the Sax@@ on Parliament continues .
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary question , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the watch@@ man of four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil to prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who carries the lower Sax@@ on SPD as a top candidate in the German elections , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career re@@ jects of a future CDU de@@ pu@@ ties in the elec@@ toral result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he urged to clari@@ fy the background .
I want to know if there was more or there is no further charge of the CDU of Lower Saxony .
conveyor belt for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
those who would like to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of the Ste@@ er Urban Development will begin on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen as well .
on the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a look back on the past .
since 1991 there have been mat@@ isation areas in Emp@@ fingen regions .
back then , in the area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the total funding amount .
at the san@@ itation zone II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus still was 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the former bud@@ gets are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is very important to promote interior development , and not just develop new construction sites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 4 April , one of the information of the government of government , Karlsruhe , will receive information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the total amount was 8@@ 33 333 euro , of which would be 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church emp@@ tied .
how is a sanit@@ ising market now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investig@@ ate such sh@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it plays a role either in the planned area of interest , to renov@@ ate .
if necessary , the area borders may also move again .
the ste@@ g was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal state @-@ country program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which framework the renov@@ ations would then be performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of the program are re@@ aliz@@ ations of indoor towns , improving the living and employment and building infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measures would be objec@@ t@@ uted , i.e. , per land , carried out .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be established as a by@@ laws .
the elig@@ i@@ bility period for the funding period runs until January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , only once the survey was carried out , within the scope of which involved parties involved in the refurb@@ ishment , have received a quest@@ ionn@@ aire to fill out .
as possible in November or December , the deadline for the proposition can begin to begin with the refurb@@ ishment in the coming year .
afterwards Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every municipality had to carry out the prec@@ ed@@ ented pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about to assess the urban ab@@ normal@@ ities and decide when will be renovated and in what extent will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be registered in the book for the respective plot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to Emp@@ fingen and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project to co @-@ operation of the involved .
therefore , there will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires , to be sent to citizens in the coming weeks , until the end of the summer holidays can be completed .
the yellow quest@@ ionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and plot of building , &quot; in which it works for the structural condition and refurb@@ ishing views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey quest@@ ionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , partition and inhabitants of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blue &quot; operating arc &quot; is only possible if in the building premises are operated .
however , to be observed , Got@@ zel denied that a filling quest@@ ionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler has also stressed that the distribution of funding to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ id principle &quot; function - who comes first , gr@@ in@@ ds first .
no funding will be reserved for later . &quot;
at the end , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make a restoration work &quot; tasty . &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to come with a manual movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip that he can enter his door , enter his office and even start with a manual movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and po@@ inters and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has merged with Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advis@@ ory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ists in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant@@ ation process is performed according to medical standard .
the technology re@@ sembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 each lock .
the married father of one has now fitted both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the White House advertising expenses cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly to the South La@@ wn through an event that focuses primarily for the US production in the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers are left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President on board is the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ president Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter used in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter in the South La@@ wn , after the recordings of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of that , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Commander of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event its predecessor , the Deputy Military Tribunal for Aircraft . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter ho@@ ved around 15 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn at the South La@@ wn and so long until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note that if the flight departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restri@@ ction of service hours a second squ@@ ad would be needed for return flight .
during the event , the original flight was during the helicopter , while security personnel remained on the ground during the time .
the recordings provided by the TIM@@ E were not clear , but ultimately , a second flight number was required .
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal authority to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds like if you are closed , &quot; the Deputy Command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the official events have political over@@ tones .
on the event , the President gave a impulse to the reform of the health reform , which was underway in the Senate and he proph@@ es@@ ied the efforts to overcome the rule of government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advant@@ ageous purposes .
presi@@ dents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is un@@ common .
in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation as the presidential aircraft before the background of his first battle r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy editor of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and the South La@@ wn in order to reset the US President in the White House with precise enti@@ re@@ ars .
in the beginning of July , when Tr@@ ump was on the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 carried out 58 exercise circuits in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event attracted at the training requirements for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ Presi@@ dential support &quot; .
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers have not presented the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps taken at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in order to extra@@ dite Hel@@ icop@@ ter &apos;s helicopter .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintain bud@@ get@@ ary drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the academic year of the Secretary of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D was 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
record of the unit recorded the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are lying close at this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for tax@@ pay@@ ers are based on the basis of estimates , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs that are contained in annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , replacement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and contract .
at that time , the White House , Sean Sp@@ agna , def@@ ended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ eyer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked in@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is reasonable to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
it wasn &apos;t clear if Tr@@ ump with the helicopter were inter@@ ned when he entered his tour through the South La@@ wn as he entered the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ ok@@ ing with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

despite the five games still mak@@ es@@ el@@ os@@ er , the leader of the second tennis league won the sense of reality .
team Director Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has always respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in a similar formation .
just in the rear positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , mainly imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup .

how America can harm the OMV
as a Wednesday evening , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work as he put his signature on the law to ti@@ gh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ple@@ a , the law is en@@ acted , a few &quot; un@@ constitutional prescri@@ ptions &quot; were packed , et@@ ched .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected and even Brussels sh@@ amed against the U.S. advance .
after all , the proposal is to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
accordingly , investors of the European OMV , together with other European companies , have contributed to the construction of the Russian Baltic Region North Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is tremendous .
nevertheless , it is too early for a estimate of consequences , so the official statement of oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump even would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions from an executive order .
twelve weapons are present for him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked at which the Group could waste and which could really hurt him .

the Staff@@ ing three and four have been confirmed by streaming service , the first one received its first trailer and showed the newest bows of the show .

escal@@ ator backwards : the city presents 46 kitchen@@ ettes
the city organized the K@@ ita lunch @-@ style again .
with firm contact partners for the children and the assignment of the team .
in the municipal day@@ care centers the clock will be turned back .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supplies in the urban kinder@@ garten ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ich , Deputy Head of Youth Aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked by house . a Cat@@ erer takes this task and provides fresh @-@ boiled cooled down .
the town runs in the area of 46 day@@ care centres in 44 , where children receive a warm meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last Kit@@ a@@ year 2800 children were at the tables and the need grows constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are over@@ looked after 45 weeks in the K@@ ita in the mid@@ day , explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 participants from 1 September kitchen service : they warm the meals included , supplement them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , clean rooms , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ich .
the size - there are two groups as well as seventh group facilities - decides on the timet@@ able .
&quot; the food hel@@ in@@ ers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier for the kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for that &apos;s why it comes : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is advant@@ ageous .
also for the kids .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar with them , and not ever changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as well as the kitchen counter @-@ stock - will be settled by special cleaning agents in future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , it also has the charm finding it out between self @-@ reg@@ ression and equipment for the city as the most economic one , it says from the press office .
and that , even though 46 new forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 persons in the educational field , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative , if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , reig@@ ning leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are in the provinces of the provinces . three women are responsible for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .

Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban will have thre@@ ats against a election trial , which comp@@ ose an advis@@ ory role with the transition from international batt@@ lements on an advis@@ ory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , the elections for the first time will be peaceful from a demo@@ cr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
Afghan independent elec@@ toral commission reported that 1.2 million women of registered 3.6 million voters registered .

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to make some managers of the Bis@@ c@@ it producer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their production plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had s@@ led over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which manufactures Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that staff and trade representatives were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the firm &apos;s branch of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on &quot; concerns &quot; concerns that the financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines is not driven forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ iser Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity on the future needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , aff@@ ecting our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have been working here and labour concentr@@ ates strongly on the local community and the large @-@ room Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in a field with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , at the prosp@@ ect of work@@ places , the wage and prosperity , and in front of the Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of living and chronic production decre@@ ases , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently need a peaceful production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ e has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , since we estimate continuous efforts in employees and trade unions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed with the staff we operate like all companies working in a extremely competitive and un@@ safe business climate , our shops continuously check - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operating improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . should our company processes change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago ?
the page of La League enjoys your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not given up in the pursu@@ it of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after receiving an offer of £ 189 million in order to em@@ ulate its free@@ wheel cl@@ auses , but have they warned us three years ago in front of the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has been heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season .
after finishing , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sports@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way , how Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way to outside , although a source of the Catal@@ ans board has always given that the club has always been his best to take care of him from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but was the football world warned three years ago from the PS@@ G president before this prosp@@ ect ?
when Manchester City will show interest in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi was a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign a one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried about knowing if they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , we will contact them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the beginning of this summer with the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that it would not allow it to leave the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing some of their price quotes by Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ spar@@ row @-@ Report &quot; was the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Brandenburg Dom@@ spar@@ row report on the abuse of abuse has reli@@ eved Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means the author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ing , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after publication by the German press agency , he ob@@ servatory from the former Reg@@ ens@@ berg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ ge Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would be very common to see the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret on their own under@@ cover or their wrong evaluation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , critic@@ ised that in the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ ab pads with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; regards the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be punished by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it that signi@@ fies the Catholic Church as a source of all evil work is already a part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Scar@@ aff@@ ia writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Für@@ st@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn und Taxis meant in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re looking forward to the church and this is a found fres@@ cos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stripes have been a quite educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with fre@@ t children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with reports about the abuse , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; totally in@@ justice , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all of this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the findings of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report which was awarded by the bishop in Regensburg with the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ary lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ ile Dom@@ spar@@ ks were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ spar@@ ks sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; summar@@ ize that from Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and mental force were applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at high Emot@@ ions , the punishment for students could also be more fer@@ o@@ cious .
nevertheless , unlike numerous other acc@@ us@@ ations , many victims of the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories of him . &quot;
in an interview , H@@ es@@ emann explains why the final report describes the abuse of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of violence on protective results &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many students bring forth his &quot; humanity . &quot;
for the other , it also appears as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was able to handle the more difficult times when a Dom@@ ot@@ atz was no top performance .
how do you analyse this final report as a biograph@@ er ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all .
just eight pages are devoted to him and it is acquitted clearly by every sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the violence of violence took place outside of its sphere of action .
they can ban it if late , too late , or have not taken our first hin@@ ts seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in practically all the respon@@ dents , in which he worked , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practically all respon@@ dents - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger represents a very excellent report , describes him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sin@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as an extremely skilled teacher , who provided the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
merely a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high Emot@@ ions , who also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ qu@@ arri@@ es .
that he threw not only with chairs and threw the key ring onto the ground , but also ear@@ ing too bold guys on the hair or ears , he has already been granted , deeply regret , and ap@@ ologi@@ ze for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , to his honour , however , that such educational methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely distributed in parents as with teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you also know such bre@@ eder methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state school .
compared to what it actually goes on in this report , namely the appe@@ aling sexual abuse and the non @-@ violence on the pre@@ school , that is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
you &apos;re wonder@@ ing if it doesn &apos;t seem to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just over@@ threw him .
at the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him , are still eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
but the truth is : the report ab@@ duc@@ ed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media reports were clearly reported about the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also under@@ take any transaction or sc@@ aff@@ inity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entru@@ sted to the domain master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother to talk about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a concrete representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem with re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of sexual abuse has been and yet is that most victims are silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral director who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ spar@@ rows student R@@ atz@@ inger play a role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had had left un@@ tim@@ ely findings and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; I think it ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also absurd to assume that it exclu@@ de him ... Bu@@ ben an urgent or clear@@ er or more obvious or more obvious , compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ors , trust teachers etc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report comes to a clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pupils involved in advance and / or their surroundings , could not be confirmed in the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what concerns sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus exemp@@ li@@ fied by every mit@@ ig@@ ation .
thus , he cannot be accused of having prevented or brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to put his good name with these contra@@ cted crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent food &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read by the shel@@ ters in the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ en@@ cap@@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be thrown out in his report . &quot;
does he have to live with this alle@@ g@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the coverage all bl@@ ends and men@@ tions to a huge bag of sexual abuse and violent ex@@ changes and somewhere , in the middle of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly a mis@@ use of the report .
it is clean separately : between the pre@@ school and the high school of Dom@@ spar@@ row , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other claims .
the report also deals with inci@@ dents in the period since 1945 , so after four decades of which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the chorus of the domain .
the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the l@@ ad were tor@@ tured and pain@@ stak@@ ingly cont@@ ested , and among them suffered , happened at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where truly sk@@ in@@ ous states have to have re@@ igns .
but with them , Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only on his face when they were already in the gymn@@ as@@ ium .
on that , as most of the witnesses are emphas@@ ized , the topic &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; tab@@ oo .
it was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different from the gymn@@ as@@ ium physi@@ que ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there indeed were discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at the conclusion that the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims were in@@ crimin@@ ated and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most acc@@ us@@ ation , at most , remains to be looked at .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the conditions at school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself , and from operations at a school which he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) would not hear , and then again at 1993 .
Lock Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently uph@@ eld the ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Cathedral Division , which was even re@@ produced .
in this way , he points out that in the pre@@ school , the test penalty will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
he recommended even in face of the risk of negative profits .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was banned when testing was also forbidden in Bavaria .
before that she occurred in a law@@ n@@ ly gray area , as everyone knows of us know .
it was hard to estimate him , where the people were perhaps ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where truly the ad@@ missible border had been crossed .
but you can &apos;t say , he would have gone away .
that &apos;s just not right .
only in 1980 , the test penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
princip@@ ality in Gloria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said yes , it is un@@ fair to apply the current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards for that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger , past today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess has already been right .
but this is not true for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ om@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of ad@@ vers@@ aries and violence against innocent children &apos;s men , that &apos;s far beyond that .
that &apos;s all quite dre@@ ad@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be stopped .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all of this had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and punishment , so to give ear and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was prohibited , it also stri@@ ves around .
which picture of his reg@@ ained time , George R@@ atz@@ inger has played in the discussions with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
was the subject of the test conducted in the language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , the cathedral @-@ cats only played a minor part .
still , I don &apos;t waste any way , that he led an aust@@ ere regim@@ ent there .
but also this must be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without signi@@ fying un@@ conditional discipline , it wouldn &apos;t have been possible to form the real cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and cand@@ y alone one does not make a big singer and a huge singer every success , but always in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on their book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : by working on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and experienced again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , belie@@ ving , deep belie@@ ving and heart@@ ily good people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could just do something like a fly .
I regularly receive , like many former Dom@@ spar@@ ks still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ itus , regularly contact him to visit him , he is almost blind and as a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him till today , that he was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of them are grateful to him that he en@@ rich their lives and brought about the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lo@@ vable respect person was to look at her today and hon@@ oring them .
and please , even more clearly : everything you have imag@@ ined , are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have long over@@ overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make media coverage .
that is the evil intention behind it , but it is all too obvious .
for the report that has just been published was reli@@ eved him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has gained great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps in Germany nobody would have known the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ ks to finally make peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
